# Chaos Engineering vol. 2!

Did you love the first Chaos Engineering conference? Well, you ain’t seen nothing yet!

This time we’re taking this whole thing to a completely different level. With our amazing speakers, you’re going to get the insights into the blameless culture, what it really means to embrace failure and how to deal with the uncertainty in Chaos Engineering, just to mention a few. 
Listen to [Leonid Belkind](https://www.conf42.com/Chaos_Engineering_2021_Leonid_Belkind_generic_mitigations_self_healing_systems) talking about the power of a “Chaos Engineering + Generic Mitigation” combo. And the author of a truly inspiring book: [“Chaos Engineering: Site reliability through controlled disruption”](https://www.manning.com/books/chaos-engineering), [Mikolaj Pawlikowski](https://www.conf42.com/Chaos_Engineering_2021_Mikolaj_Pawlikowski_chaos_engineering_2021), will once and for all solve the great “shark vs hamburger” mystery… 

Come and see for yourself! All the talks are available on our website. 
Also a big “thank you” to our Gold sponsor, [StackPulse](https://stackpulse.com/).
