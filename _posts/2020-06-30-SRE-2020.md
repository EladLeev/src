# Site Reliability Engineering 2020 event!

Welcome to our first conference on Site Reliability Engineering!

We have a set of 10 exciting talks. [Daniel “Spoons” Spoonhower](https://www.conf42.com/Site_Reliability_Engineering_2020_Daniel_Spoons_Spoonhower_service_ownership_distributed_tracing) will give you a sneak peek into service ownership and its benefits for your team. [Nikolaus Rath](https://www.conf42.com/Site_Reliability_Engineering_2020_Nikolaus_Rath_application_product_ownership) will cover the reasons behind moving from single applications to end-user workflow. And the real cherry on top, [Mikolaj Pawlikowski](https://www.conf42.com/Site_Reliability_Engineering_2020_Mikolaj_Pawlikowski_sre_chaos_engineering) is going to break down the relationship between SRE and Chaos Engineering for you. And we’re just getting started!
