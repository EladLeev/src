In response, Software Bill of Materials or SBOMs are being quickly adopted by enterprises around the globe, so what are they all about? The Linux Foundation research team revealed that 78% of organizations expect to produce or consume the Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in 2022.

You can tune into this session to learn about this emerging standard, how it can improve the security of your supply chain, and open source tools to help you generate and analyze SBOMs and the future of SBOMs.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciara-carey-7540173/,@Ciara_Carey_,,,,dso_ciara_carey.png,https://youtu.be/tJuBe8qzxYw,"software,bill,of,materials,sboms,actionable",

With an increase in the number of APIs, it complexities associated with managing the APIs increase proportionally. We need a sustainable solution to manage our entire API lifecycle efficiently. We can achieve this with the help of MuleSoft’s Universal API management. In this session, we shall learn more about Universal API management and how to manage, secure, and govern the APIs effectively throughout the lifecycle

yes,,Kenneth DuMez,Developer Relations Engineer,Teleport,,,,Say Goodbye to Manual Kubernetes User Access Onboarding,"This talk will focus on the challenges with configuring access control for Kubernetes clusters and why it’s so important to make Kubernetes access both simple and secure. Any engineer that has worked with Kubernetes before — either as an administrator, user or developer — knows that cluster configuration is a massive iceberg. At the tip of the iceberg, you have “just make it work.” At this level one engineer can access one cluster. In some cases this can be tricky enough by itself.

Below the surface however, you get other problems quickly: infrastructure security, credential management, identity-native access, RBAC role management, audit-logging and compliance standards. And then once you figure those out you have to ask: But what about at scale? What if you have tens, hundreds, maybe thousands of clusters? What if you have a team of 40, or 200 engineers? Configuring Kubernetes access in a secure, manageable way can be an extremely daunting task. This is where open-source Teleport comes in. Teleport makes it easy to securely onboard and off-board Kubernetes access for engineers at scale, without the need for hours of manual configuration, all without using long-lived credentials. This talk will include an overview of the problem-space for Kubernetes access today, an indepth look at the technology behind Teleport and a live-demo of accessing and managing a cluster with Teleport. Learn how open-source Teleport can ease the stress of your DevOps team, and allow your security engineers to sleep peacefully at night without worrying about Kubernetes attacks.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenneth-dumez-086b84220/,,,,,dso_kenneth_dumez.png,https://youtu.be/mFxVAI-NOew,"goodbye,manual,kubernetes,user,access,onboarding",
