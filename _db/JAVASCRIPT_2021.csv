Well, how about a little change of perspective?

With software development and users' needs evolving so fast, we don’t afford the luxury of rewriting systems from scratch just because teams fail to understand what they are building. Today’s software developers are tomorrow's architects. We must challenge them to step away from the IDE and understand how the architecture evolves in order to create a common and stable ground in terms of quality, performance, reliability, and scalability. At the same time, software architects need to step away from the abstractions and stay updated to the project development reality.

This session revolves around finding the right ways of intertwining up-front architecture, API design & coding while maintaining a continuous focus on architecture evolution.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghidersam/,@mihaelag12,,,,js_mihaela-roxana.png,"This session revolves around finding the right ways of intertwining up-front architecture, API design & coding while maintaining a continuous focus on architecture evolution.","many faces,architecture",

But, like any standard, it needs to evolve to stay relevant, both in the assumptions on how sites are working and what is the reality in the implementation. In this talk, we will discuss those gaps. First, we will demonstrate how the standard can be abused and is abused when facing real-world uses. Second, we will cover multiple implementation gaps causing it to misbehave in browsers and expose information to attackers. Third, we will review and analyze bad implementations by website owners who place poor configuration, misunderstandings of the directives and outdated configurations. These three gaps between the standard and real-world uses will be the basis to discuss the improvements and considerations DevSecOps need to consider using CSP while discussing ideas on how to improve the standard.

The talk will cover the following points:
1. A brief overview of the history behind CSP (3 minutes)
2. The timeline of main changes, early versions to current (5 minutes)
3. Where it went wrong - abusing the safelist concept to inject code and extract information (15 minutes)
4. Examples of poor implementation by browsers - not covering all angles, CVEs and other gaps (10 minutes)
5. Poor usage examples by webmasters (5 minutes)
6. Thoughts on how CSP 3 (or 4) can remediate that to make a more secure internet (5 minutes)

Ever since, the technical possibilities with which MicroFrontends can be implemented have changed significantly and the options have increased considerably.

On the client-side we came from dilettante approaches based on iFrames and settled up with more elaborated strategies like Webpack Module-Federation or EcmaScript Import-Maps. We moved from pure Edge-Side-Includes to full fletched frameworks that allow us to compose MicroFrontends more comfortably and sustainably on the server-side. And even during the implementation, we achieved entirely new possibilities by more mature ways to manage MonoRepos and distributed or incremental builds. By showing real-world examples, we will go into detail about the evolution of these different approaches.

Upon a closer look at the challenges that still remain, it will become clear that none of these new concepts and tools come for free but with a fair amount of newly introduced complexity.

These apps are developed independently but stitched as a SPA on the fly with all the goodies of client-side javascript. This has been done traditionally with several approaches, but with webpack 5 we now have module federation, which opens the door for seamless Microfrontend integrations.

But, in order to enjoy the benefits of the declarative programming style of React, under the hood a tree comparison algorithm known as the Reconciliation Algorithm runs on each state or prop update.

While the algorithm is very performant and effective, it does have performance impact, and sometimes stepping out of the reconciliation loop is the better choice.

When writing code in React there is sometimes a tendency to try and solve every problem in the application using React's APIs, usually by searching for a specific library written with React. For example, you want to implement drag and drop? No problem - just DuckDuckGo """"React Drag and Drop Library"""" and pick one of the many libraries out there.

But sometimes, using React's state and prop updates is not the best choice to handle things. React's reconciliation algorithm triggering comes with a cost and in order to create fast and responsive web applications we should take that into account.

Hundreds of open source javascript libraries render charts and graphs for the web, and there’s rarely one best option for any given project. A good solution will result in a tool your developers enjoy working with, accessible visualizations your end-users love consuming, and a site that runs fast. But with so many options, how can you be confident in your choice? In this presentation, I’ll outline a process you can use to identify what your application requires from a charting library, evaluate which option will best support it, and explain your recommendation.

The presentation follows a fictional company (Superhero Trackers, Inc) as they design and build a new interactive superhero statistics dashboard. I'll recommend questions to ask during the design phase and strategies for narrowing down many options to a few final candidates. Next, we’ll examine a sample node application I’ve built with each library in order to rank two shortlisted choices, D3 and chart.js, according to accessibility, performance, and ease of development. I’ll discuss best practices for implementing accessible interactive data visualizations and demonstrate the different accessibility options each charting library affords. I will show you how to use tools like Webpack bundle analyzer and Lighthouse to estimate the performance impact of each library on the final product. Finally, I'll summarize my experience working with each library and describe the criteria I use to evaluate their relative ease of development. By outlining my process, I aim to provide a model you can use to inform charting library decisions in your own future applications.
