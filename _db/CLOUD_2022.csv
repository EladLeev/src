Yes,,Josh Stella,Chief Architect,Snyk,,,,Understanding Cloud Control Plane Compromise Attacks,"When the headline reads “Cloud Breach Due to Misconfiguration”, this is only a small part of the story, causing teams to focus solely on eliminating cloud resource misconfigurations and getting a false sense of security. 

What’s missing in these stories is the series of moves attackers make to discover knowledge about the cloud environment, move laterally, and ultimately extract data without detection. When they gain access to an environment, they’re after API keys that enable them to begin operating against the API control plane of the cloud provider. And once a control plane compromise attack begins, it’s too late to stop it. 

In this session, Josh Stella - Chief Architect at Snyk - will deconstruct how control plane compromise attacks go down in the cloud, and how teams can recognize and address the architectural design flaws in their cloud environment that make them vulnerable. 

You’ll walk away from this session with an understanding of:

No,getting started,Rosemary Wang,Developer Advocate,HashiCorp,,,,A Developer’s Introduction to Service Mesh,"In the ideal development practice, we secure, shape, and observe traffic between services with a **single** line of code. However, most environments have multiple types of applications running many versions across diverse workloads and platforms, from containers to public cloud to private datacenter. With so many platforms and application frameworks, you cannot use the same code libraries across all services to shape traffic, secure communications, or enhance observability. How can we reduce the development and operational complexity?

In this session, you dive into why and how a service mesh can alleviate the management complexity of shaping, securing, and observing traffic across multiple platforms and environments. First, I'll provide a short introduction to the session's setup, which uses HashiCorp Consul and Envoy proxy on Kubernetes. Then, you will learn how to implement and debug traffic shaping and certificate management in the mesh. Finally, you will configure tracing and metrics collection for your service mesh application and examine the telemetry in Prometheus and Jaeger.

In this talk we're going to demystify the differences between all of these concepts that are the byproduct of large-scale, rapid adoption and growth of cloud operations. Cloud operation were widely impacted by the introduction of Infrastructure as Code practices which changed the way we manage our cloud. That said, cloud deployments that predate IaC were often not codified and managed via UI or cloud APIs - which has led to a mishmash in the way cloud resources are managed and maintained today.  We will go on to focus on how and when ghost assets happen, why you might have these haunting assets and what to do about them - hopefully without spooking you out too much.

Monoliths, to microservices to Functions as a Service. Applications and infrastructure are getting more and complex. At the same time the tolerance for down time is rapidly shrinking. This all drives the need to be able be very reactive or better still proactive to keep things operating smoothly. ChatOps takes us to a place where we can potentially be far more mobile and not bound to a computer terminal. But ChatOps is not normal ops from a phone. Scrolling through screens of terminal output will not work. The first step to ChatOps is to get our monitoring to extract the relevant information and communicate just that data. Proactive monitoring using tools like Fluentd is a 1st step.

In this session, we will explore how we can use Fluentd to be highly reactive if not proactive and provide just the necessary information as the 1st step to effective chat ops, including a demo of a quite simple proactive operation.  We will look at what more needs to be in place to facilitate effective ChatOps.  To do this we will explore and demos some examples of Fluentd and how it makes life easier & more efficient.

Perhaps for image recognition, speech recognition, fraud detection, recommendation engines, or something new on your application. Adding Machine learning to your application isn’t as hard to understand as you might think. In short, ML involves using pattern recognition software to find trends in data, building models that explain the trends/patterns, and then using the models to predict something.

In this talk, we will discuss the following:

* A high-level overview of machine learning for people with little or no knowledge of computer science.

* Create and test a machine learning model on a streaming dataset.

* Load a model and use it with new data.

No,security,Peter Bosch,Distinguished Engineer,Cisco,,,,"APIs, the Universe, and Everything","Cloud-native application security involves balancing contradictory requirements: the benefits of cloud services in accelerating development, while at the same time handling security in an adverse environment where there are more attack surfaces and opportunities for data breaches. Today, tools exist that focus specifically on the security and vulnerability posture of cloud workloads. Container and configuration vulnerabilities are identified, and enforcement policies are enacted to protect the workloads if these are operating with such vulnerabilities.

Unfortunately, many security tools do not address the vulnerabilities of APIs. Cloud-native applications expose many internal API services and developers are increasingly using external API services for their applications. Both internal and external API use expose the workload to new vulnerabilities; more strongly, workload security and API security are really two sides to the same coin. This talk specifically focuses on the security problems and vulnerabilities exposed through APIs.

Questions we address include:
What does a developer know about a service before using it?
Does a poorly defined interface expose API service vulnerabilities?
Does the service perform well to begin with?
How does the developer get/maintain an access token?
Do API specs show critical use cases and dependencies?
Can the security impact of an external API service be estimated and managed?
Do the APIs violate the OWASP API top 10?
How can we test against the OWASP API top 10?
Can PII be shared with such services?
We show how SecureCN addresses both sides of the security coin: container workload and API security in one tool, and we present actual issues with a live demonstration of SecureCN.

With the ever increasing data storage and query requirements, new challenges are brought forward for horizontal elastic expansion and security of the PostgreSQL database. 

How to provide existing PostgreSQL databases with incremental capabilities such as data sharding, data encryption and other functions is of great concern to many PostgreSQL users.

This will focus on introducing how to empower PostgreSQL thanks to the ecosystem provided by Apache ShardingSphere - an open source distributed database, plus an ecosystem users and developers need for their database to provide a customized and cloud-native experience. 

ShardingSphere doesn't quite fit into the usual industry mold of a simple distributed database middleware solution. ShardingSphere recreates the distributed pluggable system, enabling actual user implementation scenarios to thrive and contributing valuable solutions to the community and the database industry. The aim of ShardingSphere is the Database Plus concept.

Database Plus sets out to build a standard layer and an ecosystem layer above the fragmented database's basic services. A unified and standardized database usage specification provides for upper-level applications, and the challenges faced by businesses due to underlying databases fragmentation get minimized as much as possible. 
To link databases and applications, it uses traffic and data rendering and parsing. It provides users with enhanced core features, such as a distributed database, data security, database gateway, and stress testing.

ShardingSphere uses a pluggable kernel architecture for Database Plus. That means there's modularity, which provides flexibility for the user.

The ability to influence the service mesh based on networking telemetry data adds even greater power to the microservice application model and the service mesh.  In a multicloud service mesh, optimizing intercloud service communication is highly desirable and service mesh endpoint routing capability is a nice addition to the operations toolbox. This talk will show how an SDN controller, using Istio's telemetry and mesh state, can adopt the network for optimal application performance.

This talk combines principals from effective monitoring with microservice architecture patterns to define criteria that will set microservice organizations up for success. 

One example of effective techniques include having consistency across all services since this consistency can centralize the definition of observability & what it means to have an “observable” system, make it easier to set up monitoring for services, and enable engineers to troubleshoot production issues across their own services and service dependencies. 

Another example is having SLOs that align well with microservice ownership. Much like any given team should not own more than a few services, any given team also should not own more than a few different SLOs. I will dive into the organizational benefits that microservices provides and SRE reinforces by implementing SLOs. 

Thirdly, how the main units of an observable system (events) align well with event-driven microservices. I will go into specifics on how events, logs, metrics, and traces relate to one another.

Bug or hotfix comes through and you want to start working on it right away so you create a branch and start fixing. What you don’t do is create a Jira ticket but then later your boss/PM/CSM yells at your due to lack of visibility. I share how I automated ticket creation in Slack by correlating Github to Jira.

You have 20 minutes until your next meeting and you open a pull request and start a review. But you get pulled away half way through and when you come back the next day you forgot everything and have to start over. Huge waste of time. I share an ML job I wrote that tells me how long the review will take so I can pick PRs that fit the amount of time I have.

You build. You ship it. You own it. Great. But after I merge my code I never know where it actually is. Did the CI job fail? Is it release under feature flag? Did it just go GA to everyone?

In fact, debugging in a modern production environment is even harder - orchestrators spinning containers up and down and weird networking wizardry that keeps everything glued together, make understanding systems that much more difficult than it used to be.

And, while k8s is well understood by DevOps people by now, it remains a nut that developers are still trying to crack. Where do you start when there’s a production problem? How do you get the tools you’re used to in the remote container? How do you understand what is running where and what is its current state? 

In this talk, we will review debugging a production application deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, and review kubectl debug - a new feature from the Kubernetes sig-cli team. In addition, we’ll review the open source KoolKits project that offers a set of (opinionated) tools for kubectl debug.

KoolKits builds on top of kubectl debug by adding everything you need right into the image. When logging into a container, we’re often hit with the scarcity of tools at our disposal. No vim (for better or worse), no DB clients, no htop, no debuggers, etc… KoolKits adds all the tools you need right out of the box and lets you inspect a production container easily without resorting to endless installation and configuration cycles for each needed package.

We’ll finish the talk by delving into how to get better at debugging on a real-world scale. Specifically, we’ll talk about how to be disciplined in our continuous observability efforts by using tools that are built for k8s scale and can run well in those environments, while remaining ergonomic for day to day use.

Considering a cloud-agnostic strategy is an affordable option to efficiently build and run cloud-native applications. 

The popularity of cloud-agnostics is not a new occurrence. Most organizations examine a cloud agnostic strategy due to the savings. It’s expensive to maintain and run servers. You need a dedicated IT person or company to manage the servers just to keep up with the load which quickly becomes a costly headache. Going cloud-agnostic frees your company from the shackles and helps save money.

When you choose cloud-agnostics, there are costs involved for the orchestration or executions, but they are not very much and won’t break the bank compared to running and maintaining servers. You pay for the number of executions which occur in each millisecond by using the API when you send and receive information. A short task is not overly costly compared to using a server. 

It’s true, nothing in the world of technology is perfect or might even meet your particular needs. As with anything, there are some downsides to cloud-agnostics. After this talk we are confident that you’ll discover the benefits of cloud-agnostic technologies far outweigh the drawbacks for most organizations.
