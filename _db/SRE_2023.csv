yes,,Travis Rodgers,Developer Relations Engineer,Teleport,,,,Replacing Privileged Users With Automated Just-in-Time Access Requests,"Managing privileged access to resources has for many been a cumbersome process. As developers often need temporary access to resources beyond their normal day-to-day duties, it often falls on SREs to respond to these numerous ticketed requests. In addition, employees often require to break glass, thus sharing super-privileged admin accounts to circumvent or expedite the process. 

With the rise of just-in-time privileged access solutions, engineers can apply the principle of least privilege, and escalate when required, in a secure and effective manner. In this talk, we’ll
look at how we can use an open-source access platform like Teleport to securely automate just-in-time-access (JIT access) to its managed infrastructure in tandem with everyday messaging tools used by engineering teams like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or PagerDuty.

Combined with the right role-based access control (RBAC) in place, teams can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the need for admin accounts.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/travisdotmedia/,@travisdotmedia,,,Conf42 SRE 2023 - Travis Rodgers.pdf,sre_travis_rodgers.png,https://youtu.be/3ySS8c5Ja0E,"automated,just-in-time,access,requests",30

no,culture,Mandeep Ubhi,Founder & CTO,DevSRE.org,,,,Bell the “Chaotic Cat” with SRE,"In chaos engineering, we introduce intentional chaos to find blind spots where the products may fail in a production environment. We then use the obtained knowledge about those blind spots to make the products more resilient should actual chaos hit production.

But what about the overall product development lifecycle (PDLC) where unintentional chaos takes a DevOps team’s bandwidth away from making the product what it could be? Such unintentional chaos seeps into teams as silently as a cat walks into the house and creates chaos (yes, you may recall those ‘Tom & Jerry’ episodes).

That’s what I refer to as ‘chaotic cat’.

Examples of unintentional chaos: obsession about speed (time to market); conflicting priorities within a DevOps team; manual repetitive tasks (toil); lack of monitoring & observability leading to high mean-time-to-resolve (MTTR); vendor products becoming a bottleneck in end-to-end observability; company acquisitions causing dependent application hierarchy; reactive fire fighting, etc.

But how does it all relate to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)? Isn’t SRE just about SLIs, SLOs, and Error Budgets? Well, think again; or join this power packed session where I explain how SRE helps you bell such chaotic cats.

You may argue that such chaos in PDLC is ‘business as usual’ and we really can’t eliminate that, and you’d be right. That’s why it is about ‘belling the cat’; not killing it! It is about becoming aware of what can create havoc if left unattended and then taking proactive actions.

We are not going to talk about SRE concepts, much. We are going to focus on HOW to implement specific SRE practices that help teams grow out of routine chaos in PDLC. And as a result, enable focus on improving UX of the products on business critical factors - availability, performance, and overall reliability.

In a way, we are going to talk about shifting the SRE to the left! We will look at the top 3 themes that induce unintentional chaos - speed, toil, and lack of monitoring.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandeepsu/,,,,Conf42 SRE 2023 - Mandeep Ubhi.pdf,sre_mandeep_ubhi.png,https://youtu.be/0mz86s5I4mo,"bell,chaotic cat",
