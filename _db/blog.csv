Welcome to our first-ever Conf42 Golang conference!

We couldn't be more excited for this event. 25 amazing talks delivered by speakers from around the world. We have something for everyone!

The `getting started` track will help any Golang newbie advance in their Go journey. The `security` track will allow you to learn from a CISO with decades' worth of experience, using decentralized identity tokens and even writing Quantum-Resistant code in Go! `Frameworks` covers tools like `GoPickle` and `Ent`. `Deep dive` will take you from building blockchains, to secured gRPC servers, terminal emulators, state machines and WebRTC. And finally `lessons learnt` track will share with you lessons from using concurrency primitives to building clouds... in the cloud.

The event is kicking off today, and the attendance is free for our community members. See you [there](https://www.conf42.com/golang2021)!"
