Adding Generative AI to Real-Time Streaming Pipelines,"In this talk I walk through various use cases where bringing real-time data to LLM solves some interesting problems.

In one case we use NiFi to provide a live chat between a person in Slack and several LLM models all orchestrated via NiFi and Kafka. In another case NiFi ingests live travel data and feeds it to HuggingFace and WatsonX.AI LLM models for summarization. I also do live Q&A from hosted chat webpages. We also augment LLM prompts and results with live data streams.
