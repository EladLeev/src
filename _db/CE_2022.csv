One way this is manifested through the notion of self-healing systems, that is, systems that monitor and fix themselves.

Through the use of intelligent error monitoring and feature flags, we can start to see applications that can do just that.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickhodges,@NickHodges,,,,ce_nick.png,https://youtu.be/UBqouRXnslA,self healing systems,30
Yes,,Zach Wasserman,CTO,Fleet,,,,"Glitches in the Matrix, or Taming Agent Chaos","This talk is accessible to all levels, and will include specific examples from [Fleet's codebase](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/) that will engage even advanced practitioners. We will also touch on the capabilities in [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) that help to improve reliability.

Questions posed and answered from Fleet's experience include:

* Where to focus efforts when considering performance and chaos?
* How does Fleet engineer for resiliency when our users self-host the software and have hundreds of thousands of (potentially misbehaving) agents checking in for * coordination?
* What Go tooling can we use to improve monitoring of the Fleet server both during internal performance testing and while running in production?
* How do we collect information about the infrastructure dependencies (MySQL & Redis) to understand the entire system beyond the code we control?
* How can we ensure osquery agents don't bring down the endpoints they are deployed to protect?",https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharywasserman,@thezachw,,,C42 Chaos 2022 - Zach Wasserman.pdf,ce_zach.png,https://youtu.be/hBtYFm2m2Lo,"glitches in the matrix, or taming agent chaos",30
Yes,,Ana Margarita Medina,Senior Chaos Engineer,Gremlin,,,,Continuous Reliability. How?,"As engineers we expect our systems and applications to be reliable. And we often test to ensure that at a small scale or in development. But when you scale up and your infrastructure footprint increases, the assumption that conditions will remain stable is wrong. Reliability at scale does not mean eliminating failure; failure is inevitable. How can we get ahead of these failures and ensure we do it in a continuous way?

One of the ways we can go about this is by implementing solutions like CNCF's sandbox project Keptn. Keptn allows us to leverage the tooling we already use and implement pipelines where we execute chaos engineering experiments and performance testing while implementing SLOs. Ana will share how you can start simplifying cloud-native application delivery and operations with Keptn to ensure you deploy reliable applications to production.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/anammedina,@ana_m_medina,,,C42 Chaos 2022 - Ana Margarita Medina.pdf,ce_ana.png,https://youtu.be/5NJk7wc5WII,continuous reliability,30

No,getting started,Narmatha Bala,Senior Software Engineering Manager,Microsoft CSE,,,,Confidence in Chaos - How properly applied observability practices can take the ‘chaos’ out of chaos testing,"Everyone wants to use observability because it can reduce time between a problem and a solution, but there is a difference between applying traditional observability practices and how they are applied for each custom project and scenario. Narmatha Bala is a Senior Software Engineering Manager in the Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team and runs the Observability chapter of the CSE Engineering Playbook, a best practices guide put together by development teams to accelerate the sharing of how best to work together, to quickly transfer learnings across teams with customers, particularly with new technologies and projects as a way to enable customers to carry the work forward and continue the development. CSE is a global engineering organization that works directly with the largest companies and not-for-profits in the world to tackle their most significant technical challenges. 

In this talk, Narmatha will share her experiences in instilling Observability best practices with engineers who use best utilize observability in applications versus engineers that think they do. She will cover why actionable failures are a good thing in system design, how to best define Service Level Agreements and Objectives (SLAs, SLOs), and where monitoring fits into the process. This talk is best suited for intermediate practitioners who want to improve their chaos testing by improving their observability practices.

But failures will happen, it's not an issue of IF, but a question of when. So how can we reduce the impact on our users?
In this talk, I will review the production incident cycle, the time that we are not reliable and our users are not happy which includes the time to detect, time to repair and time between failures.  I'll share a few methods to tackle each one of those parts in order to minimize incident impact both from technical and people aspects, expending on incident response and postmortems to know what is the most important thing for us, and we want to be data driven in those decisions.

I too was of that mindset until performing a focussed chaos engineering experiment, which lead to some helpful conclusions that were then utilized during a production incident.

This talk will demonstrate how these experiments eventually led to key discoveries in a system and how during a production incident, the conclusions artifact was utilized to assist with incident response. Had the chaos experiment not been performed, incident response would have taken much longer and would have been more painful for end-users.

My goal is to help provide another answer to the question ""why chaos engineering?"".

No,security,Kim Carter,Lead Security Engineer,BinaryMist,,,,Purple Teaming with OWASP PurpleTeam,"#### What is OWASP PurpleTeam?

PurpleTeam is a Developer focussed security regression testing CLI and SaaS targeting Web applications and APIs.
The CLI is specifically targeted at sitting within your build pipelines but can also be run manually.
The SaaS that does the security testing of your applications and APIs can be deployed anywhere.

Kim will briefly discuss the four year journey that has brought PurpleTeam from a proof of concept (PoC) to a production ready Developer first security regression testing CLI and SaaS.

An overview of the NodeJS micro-services with many features allowing a Build User (DevSecOps practitioner) to customise their Test Runs without having to write any tests by simply configuring a Job file.
Allowing multiple options to deal with false/true positives.
Setting alert thresholds in multiple places and for multiple testers (app-tester, tls-tester, server-tester) allowing the Build User to define what constitutes a successful or failed Test Run.

#### Why would I want it in my build pipelines?

In this section Kim will discus the problems that PurpleTeam solves, such as training the Build User with advice and tips on security defects as you fix the defects that PurpleTeam highlights.
As well as the huge cost savings of finding and fixing your application and infrastructure security defects early (as you're introducing them) as opposed to late (weeks or months later with external penetration testing) or not at all.

#### OK, I want it, how do we/I set it up?

Kim will walk you through all of the components and how to get them set-up and configured

### Great, but what do the work flows look like and how do I use it?

Let's walk through the different ways PurpleTeam can be run and utilised, such as:

* Running purpleteam stand-alone (with UI)
* Running purpleteam from within your pipelines as a spawned sub process (headless: without UI)
* Running all of the PurpleTeam components, including debugging each and every one of them if and when the need arises",https://www.linkedin.com/in/carterkim,@binarymist,,,,ce_kim.png,https://youtu.be/ELSwfpQ6o48,owasp purpleteam,
No,security,Kennedy Torkura,Co-Founder & CTO,Mitigant,,,,Defeating Ransomware Attacks with Security Chaos Engineering,"Due to the rapid increase of ransomware attacks in the last year, 2021 was tagged the  ""Golden Era of Ransomware"".  Most ransomware countermeasures recommend backups and runbooks. However, these techniques are seldom verified to ascertain the level of technical efficiency they provide. Furthermore, the human operators who use these ransomware countermeasures rarely have the opportunity to understand how to react to ransomware scenarios. A more effective way is by leveraging security chaos engineering to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings. By conducting planned experiments, ransomware countermeasures can be crafted as a hypothesis and proven. This approach enables security incident response teams to gain confidence in their technical and organizational skills as well as practice how to operate the ransomware countermeasures.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/aondona/,@run2obtain,,,,ce_kennedy.png,https://youtu.be/y_Ve7jiHDFA,defeating ransomware attacks,

No,ai,Michele Dodic,SRE DevOps Engineer,Accenture,,,,Chaos Experiments under the lens of AIOps,"Imagine this: you’re a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at a major tech giant and you are responsible for the overall system health, which is running in prod. Numerous alerts, server crashes, Jira tickets, incidents and an avalanche of responsibilities, which sometimes simply feel like a ticking time bomb. These are just some of the daily struggles an average SRE needs to go through. But why should it be like that? Well, it shouldn't - thanks to a term coined by Gartner in 2016. AIOps, meet audience. Audience, meet AIOps.

Let's extend this scenario. On top of all of the above mentioned issues, our poor SRE needs to watch out for potential security breaches and make sure nothing ever gets in through the cracks. However, by conducting proactive experimenting, continuos verification and improvement, he makes sure that the system is able to withstand these turbulent and malicious times that we're living in. Do these notions ring any bells? They sure do! Chaos Engineering, meet audience. Audience, meet Chaos Engineering.

What's our angle, you're wondering? AIOps and CE are two concepts, which are often kept separate. In this talk, we will discuss (and show you!) how both practices combined can significantly increase cyber resiliency, while at the same time maintain full E2E transparency and observability of your entire system. 

For this session, we have prepared and analyzed several use cases, followed main principles, summarized best practices and prepared a live demo through a combination of CE and AIOps tools.

Above all, we are SRE Engineers. As such, during this session, we will stay close to the SRE principles and best practices that we used to achieve our goals, e.g. reduce organizational silos, measure everything, learn from failures, analyze changes holistically, etc... As we proceed with our talk, the audience will be able to identify how these are related to AIOps, as well as CE, and finally, how it all ties together.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/michele-dodic/,,,,C42 Chaos 2022 - Michele Dodic.pdf,ce_michele.png,https://youtu.be/5Q5_vuHdOkI,chaos experiments under the lens of aiops,

2.  Short-term: This consists of choosing the best tool for the job, learning how to calibrate and change the route midway, and avoiding investing more time than needed where you don't need to.
3.  Long-term: This topic is about the challenging art of prioritizing and choosing. Here I'll cover different ways your brain works and the main frameworks on making choices and feeling optimistic about it (even in the chance of making a bad one).
