We illustrate how open Earth Observation data (or satellite imagery) can be used to measure economic activity.

The alarming speed with which the COVID19 global pandemic spread across the world and the subsequent quarantine & work-from-home (WFH) measures initiated by various governments has created an unprecedent situation. There has been a sharp decline in economic activity and the global GDP is projected to contract by 3% (IMF projections April 2020) That is equivalent to $3tn of lost economic output & precious jobs.  World Bank believes that the pandemic will also push the poorer section of the society into extreme poverty. However the pandemic has also given us an opportunity to observe the impact - EO/ Satellite data is being used to quantify the impact on the global economy. 
We discuss the various methods with which economic activity can be measured. As an example we will also illustrate how, NO2 data can be extracted from multi-spectral satellite imagery.

Django is the heavy tool while Flask is the flexible, tedious solution if not careful. This talk unveils Shopyo which leverages Flask loaded with Django advantages. Presenting a monster of a new kind.

This talk presents Shopyo. A framework to help Flask users get started quickly with a great architecture and features never seen before in the Flask world. It allows Flask people to have Django powers, and beyond. It allows the use of apps/modules with the addition of a concept called box. It also supports some Django commands like collectstatic. It comes with tests and docs ready to go. We also included a few touches of Masonite. It's much, much more than a Flask boilerplate project. In line with the Flask spirit it leaves much control of the wizardry in your hands, you the user.

The framework was designed to spin big, flexible and organised projects. The talk presents the features of the project as well as setting up a demo project.
This talk is an advanced one. It requires the user to have knowledge of common packages like flask_login, sqlalchemy, alembic & flask_migrate, flask_wtf, sqlalchemy_wtf, of concepts like multi-profile configs and the app factory pattern etc. To be a well grounded Flask dev if you like. Just go over them if you are reading these lines as the talk needs at least a conceptual knowledge of those.

## Why should you waste your time attending this presentation?
I decided to present the conclusion of years and years of Flask development as a framework which allows you to stand on the shoulders of giants from day one.

No,deep dive,Cheuk Ting Ho,Developer Relations Lead,TerminusDB,,,,How to be Pythonic? Design a Query Language in Python,"We created Python API calls that let you can make queries and manipulate data in our graph database. We thought about what will be best for Pythonistas? What will be the most Pythonic way to do it? (Is it a thing?) Here's our journey in making WOQLpy and we want to make it useful to you.

Query language is an important part of a database system, it is how people manage their data and how they can make the data useful to them. Starting from the 70s, the world is full of relational databases and SQL was the way to make queries. However, SQL is valuable to an injection attack. Lots of efforts are being used to stop those attacks and it made workflow become less efficient.

We don’t want to make the same mistake. That’s why using a Python query language is good. Having the Python community in our mind, we created WOQLpy, an open-source query language that lets users build queries in Python, instead of JSON-LD which is the native query language for our TerminusDB database. Now users can store data with a knowledge graph and make graph data visualization with Python.

In the first part of the talk, we will talk about what challenges we have when creating a query language in Python, the method we use, the idea and theory behind, and how WOQLpy work. This part will include a quick live demo of using WOQLpy so audiences can have an impression on how to make a query and get the task done, that is, getting a meaningful graph visualization form the source CSVs. The process of how to create a database and schema, loading the data form many CSVs, making a query and visualization, will be demonstrated using just one python script.

In the second part of the talk, we want to stimulate a discussion of what is a good design in Python and what is not. This part will be more interactive with the audiences, as we want to hear from you all, what would be the best for Pythonistas. By first suggesting some possible design, we will use a live voting system to gather opinions. This part of the talk will extend to the Q & A sessions to allow further discussions.

This talk is for Pythonista at all levels who are interested in starting to design a package in Python, no matter if the audience has published a python library or not. By attending this talk, audiences will learn about how to design a Python package that will be useful to Pythonistas and hopefully encourage more people to publish open-source packages online.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheukting-ho/,@cheukting_ho,,,,python_cheuk.png,,"how to be pythonic,query language",

Lets dig into problems Kafka is solving, its Python libraries and prebuilt connectors together!

Code and data go together like tomato and basil; not many applications work without moving data in some way. As our applications modernise and evolve to become more event-driven, the requirements for data are changing. In this session we will explore Apache Kafka, a data streaming platform, to enable reliable real-time data integration for your applications.
We will look at the types of problems that Kafka is best at solving, and show how to use it in your own applications. Whether you have a new application or are looking to upgrade an existing one, this session includes advice on adding Kafka using the Python libraries and includes code examples (with bonus discussion of pizza toppings) to use.
With Kafka in place, many things are possible so this session also introduces Kafka Connect, a selection of pre-built connectors that you can use to route events between systems and integrate with other tools. This session is recommended for engineers and architects whose applications are ready for next-level data abilities.

Apache Kafka is becoming the de-facto standard for streaming applications with many companies basing on Kafka their whole data pipeline.
In micro-services contexts Apache Kafka runs the fundamental role of decoupling information's producers and consumers thus making sure data pipelines are scalable and reliable.
I'm a Developer advocate at Aiven.io, leader in the managed Apache Kafka sector, spending most of my time in developer's shoes building reproducible examples of data pipelines.

A recent study by CheckPoint Research has recorded over 1,50,000 cyber-attacks every week during the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been an increase of 30% in cyber-attacks compared to previous weeks. The pandemic has been the main reason for job loss and pay cuts of people and has led to an increase in cybercrimes. Examples of cyber-attacks include phishing, ransomware, fake news, fake medicine, extortion, and insider frauds. Cyber forensics is a field that deals with the investigation of digital crimes by analyzing, examining, identifying, and recovering digital evidence from electronic devices and producing them in the court of law. Python has a great collection of built-in modules for digital forensics tasks. The talk begins with an introduction to digital crimes, digital forensics, the process of investigation, and the collection of evidence. Next, I will cover the various python modules and built-in functions required to build your first cyber forensic application. The modules covered in the discussion are pyscreenshot, PIL, secrets, argparse, hashlib, os,csv, logging, time, sys, stat and NLTK. Finally, I will demonstrate using code walk through the sample cyber forensic application.

$460 million in less than an hour.  More often, bugs expose you to a little more risk
or a little less value that you expected... but what can we do differently?
We often think of manual testing as slower and less effective than automated testing,
but most test suites haven't automated that much!  

Computers can execute all our 
pre-defined tests very quickly - and this is definitely a good thing, especially for 
regression tests - but the tricky parts are still done by humans.
We select test cases (inputs) and check that the corresponding outputs make sense;
we write functions that ""arrange, act, and assert"" for our tests; and we decide -
or script via CI systems - which tests to execute and when.

So lets explore some next-generation tools that we could use to automate these 
remaining parts of a testing workflow!

[PROPERTY-BASED TESTING](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/) helps you to write more powerful tests by automating selection 
of test cases: instead of listing input-output pairs, you describe the kind of data 
you want and write a test that passes *for all X...*.  We'll see a live demo, and 
learn something about the Python builtins in the process!

[CODE INTROSPECTION, and a handy templating tool](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ghostwriter.html), can help write tests for you.
Do you need to know any more than which code to test, and what properties should hold?

[ADAPTIVE FUZZING tools](https://hypofuzz.com/) take CI to its logical conclusion: instead of running a fixed
set of tests on each push, they sit on a server and run tests full-time... fine-tuning
themselves to find bugs in *your* project and pulling each new commit as it lands!

By the end of this talk, you'll know what these three kinds of tools can do - 
and how to get started with automating the *rest* of your testing tomorrow.

---

Is it really automated testing when you still have to write all the tests?  What if your tools:

1. wrote test code for you ('ghostwriting')
2. chose example inputs (property-based testing)
3. decided which tests to run (adaptive fuzzing)
