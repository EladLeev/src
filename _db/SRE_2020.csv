Yes,,"Daniel ""Spoons"" Spoonhower",CTO & Co-Founder,LightStep,,,,Driving Service Ownership with Distributed Tracing ,"While many organizations are rolling out Kubernetes, breaking up their monoliths, and adopting DevOps practices with the hope of increasing developer velocity and improving reliability, it’s not enough just to put these tools in the hands of developers: you’ve got to incentivize developers to use them. Service ownership provides these incentives, by holding teams accountable for metrics like the performance and reliability of their services as well as by giving them the agency to improve those metrics.

In this talk, I’ll cover how distributed tracing can serve as the backbone of service ownership. For SRE teams that are setting standards for their organizations, it can help drive things like documentation, communication, on-call processes, and SLOs by providing a single source of truth for what’s happening across the entire application. For embedded SRE teams, it can also accelerate root cause analysis and make alerts more actionable by showing developers what’s changed – even if that change was a dozen services away. Throughout the talk, I’ll use examples drawn from more than a decade of experience with SRE teams in organizations big and small.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/spoons/,@save_spoons,,,sre2020_driving_service_ownership.pdf,sre_daniel.png,https://youtu.be/azmyU4_7VYI
Yes,,Nikolaus Rath,Tech Lead,Google (SRE) London,,,,From application to product ownership: an SRE team's journey,"In the past, my team was responsible for specific applications/ executables. Now, we are responsible for specific for end-user workflows, no matter which executables they involve. I will describe the technical and social changes that necessitated and enabled this change of paradigm. At the end of 2019, our team supported in the order of 200 executables/microservices that provide functionality for Google's products in the advertising space.

This number was the result of continuous growth over more than 10 years.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolaus-rath-85342235/,,,,,sre_nikolaus.png,https://youtu.be/mZfIHxkonxg

No,deep dive,Ryan Dawson,Core Member,Seldon Open Source Team,,,,Machine Learning in Production: An Intro to MLOps,"Reliably deploying and maintaining machine learning applications is complex. There's a dizzying array of tools and they look different from the usual DevOps tools. 

To apply SRE skils to ML, we need to understand the specific challenges of ML build-deploy-monitor workflows. We'll use reference examples to understand the cycle in terms of data prep, training, rollout and monitoring. We'll see that some key challenges relate to training models from slices of large and varying data domains - a problem alien to the mainstream DevOps world.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-dawson-501ab9123/,@ryandawsongb,,,,sre_ryand.png,https://youtu.be/UlmCJl8ZsT4
