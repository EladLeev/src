Yes,,Jessica Wirt,Content Strategist,truematter,,,,UX Unicorns Do Not Exist: The Myth of the One-Person Usability Team,"So you’re ready to hire someone to help with user experience. You’ve identified usability issues with your sites, apps, or other software products, and need someone to help fix them, a single usability professional to “do UX”—whatever that means. I’m sorry to tell you, this person does not exist. And, if you try to foist all of your usability problems onto one professional, you will not get the rainbow-filled success you’re hoping for.

While UX professionals might be pretty magical beings, no one person can juggle all of the areas of expertise needed for top-tier user experience. Having a full, well-rounded usability team is always ideal. But we don’t live in a world of unicorns or ideals. You may only be able to get the budget, resources, or go-ahead for one UX hire.

If that’s where you’re at, not all is lost. You can still create more useful, usable sites and apps with a single, strategic UX hire. To make this work, you’ll need to focus less on one person to do all things UX and more on how your lone UX pro will fit into the team and skillsets you already have.

Attendees will walk away being able to:    
* Make an honest assessment of their team’s strengths and weaknesses
* Understand the value of embedding UX in their existing team structure
* Take concrete steps towards happier users and improved success online

Yes,,Manuel Carrasco Molina,Senior SwiftUI Dev & Ethical (H)ac(k)tivist,StuFF mc,,,,How Devs can save the future generations,"Manuel's passion for software development is way older than his passion for the environment. Still, over the last 10 years, he realized one cannot be more important than the other one.

If I want to leave a livable planet to my grand-children, if I want to have grand-children at all, I need to bring the argument of CO2 on the table regularly at technical meetings and conferences.

I don't want to hide under APIs ever again. I don't want the politician and activist in me to ever hide behind the programmer, because I felt I could convey the message better with slides full of code.

The time is now where I would like to try a wake up call to all of us and explain why if we don't work all together, at every level, the world as we know it, the so-called civilization will be over in 10 to 15 years.

We're the new dinosaurs, let's try to survive instead of writing the next feature in the next sprint. This sprint — the one for our future — is a way bigger story.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuffmc,@stuffmc,,,,mobile_manuel.png,,how devs can save future generations,

The journey is not easy for developers who already have large apps that use the imperative, XML-based approach and want to convert it to Jetpack Compose. The migration journey has its ups and downs, initially daunting but eventually satisfying. 

This talk will highlight that journey, Ahmed's learnings and advice for developers looking to migrate their existing Android apps to Jetpack Compose. ",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-tikiwa/,@ahmed_tikiwa,,,,mobile_ahmed.png,,"xml,transforming large app,jetpack compose",

Even more, do you know that you need to take control of certain behaviors or situations to make your code more secure? Are you using cryptography in your app? Where do you have to save the most sensitive information? Do you know that SwiftUI offers you a way to obfuscate data in less secure situations for your users?

In this talk, we will learn more about how iOS security works and how to improve your app making it more secure.

It also touches upon how we can keep complexity manageable by creating state machines that can be composed together.

No,ios,Pawel Lopusinski,iOS Developer,Glovo,,,,Obscure Swift,"#### Swift helps the developer quite a lot and has many quality of life features that can be leveraged. But sometimes these can bite us in quite unexpected ways.

Pawel will talk about 4 such cases in Swift:
- the @autoclosure annotation and a ""hidden"" retain cycle you can get there
- how to turn a Swift struct into an NSObject
- default parameters in functions and overriding them in subclasses
- and how to have multiple variables of the same name, but different type, in a single object (kind of)

Pawel believes that developers of all levels can benefit from this - newcomers will learn about language features (@autoclosure, default implementation in extension) while at the same time, together with more experienced devs, will get a chance to take a look under the hood and see what powers those features and what seemingly unexpected consequences we may encounter when using them.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawe%C5%82-%C5%82opusi%C5%84ski-86185227,@Losiowaty,,,,mobile_pawel.png,,obscure swift,
No,cross-platform,Nicola Zaghini,Engineering Manager,Phorest Salon Software,,,,I am only dreaming. Right?,"It was late 2017 when I, the Mobile Architect, was asked to evaluate React Native for the first time: a prospect client explicitly asked for it as a cross platform solution. As a Mobile Architect that built his fortune with native I clearly advised against, pitching native as the only viable option. Few months later AirBnB was sunsetting React Native. What a win, I was right! Sadly the prospect client left as the cost of two distinct developments was unsustainable. I started to doubt my decision. I was almost ready to wake up.

Later in the year I was challenged by the C-levels on how to contain the bleeding costs of double development of every aspect of our mobile products, how to solve feature disparity among platforms, how to get faster to market and so on. We can push our architecture / process as we want but there is a limit that just a technology change can break.

I put myself outside of my comfort zone by giving up on my native dogma, prepared to give cross platform, in the specific React Native, a real chance. I was out of my bed, awake.

With a great team, in a relatively short time frame, we managed to pitch, hire, develop and distribute top class native experiences for thousands of customers and tick all the C-levels requirement boxes. There is no money that would convince me back to how I used to do mobile before.

In this talk I am sharing my experience on how to successfully do cross platform, from pitching to C-levels to forming the right team for executing and delivering top class native mobile apps that delight your customers!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolazaghini,@nzaghini,,,,mobile_nicola.png,,"dreaming,reactnative,cross-platform",
No,cross-platform,Lucas Cesar Nogueira Fonseca,Developer Advocate & iOS Specialist,Zup Innovation,,,,How to update apps and perform rollouts without going through stores from a single code?,"When we talk about **mobile development** processes, we inevitably come across the slow process of deploying in stores and the apprehension of performing application rollout. This apprehension when rolling out the application to the entire base comes from the fear of making mistakes, the difficulty in capturing user feedback and the delay in delivering the updated version of the application to the end user. However, there are technologies that help us to reduce these bottlenecks and one of them is the **Server-Driven UI**, a concept that uses cross-platform development as an alternative to automate deploys and update apps without going through the store. 

#### Server-Driven UI
SDUI is an emerging technique used by companies like Airbnb, Spotify and Lyft that leverage the server to build the user interfaces of their mobile apps. This opens up new possibilities and addresses some fundamental challenges with native mobile app development.

In a traditional native mobile app, the UI layout and presentation is created by a developer and is included in the app design. The app package is uploaded to the App Sttore/ Play Store, where it is reviewed by Apple or Google and then made available for users to download.

User interfaces in these applications become dynamic by separating the UI from the data it displays. Although the UI is part of the application binary, the data is typically fetched from a server and embedded in the UI, so the user interface is built into the application, making it inflexible and difficult to update. In an SDUI implementation, the responsibility for describing screens is removed from the application, so when the application makes a request to the server, it returns not only the data but also the application's UI.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucascesarnf,@lucascesarnf,,,,mobile_lucas.png,,"update apps,perform rollouts,no going through stores, single code",
