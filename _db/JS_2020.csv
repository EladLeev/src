I go over what makes a PWA amazing and how to make beautiful web apps that blur the lines with native apps, with their UI and offline capabilities; so much so that users might not even tell the difference.

Most people think if they want to build an app they must build two apps for Android or iOS. The web has become so much more powerful in what we can do though. JavaScript frameworks allow developers to build powerful web app with a fraction of the time and resources of native apps. While tools like Ionic are allowing developers to make beautiful web apps that look and behave so much like native application with their UI and offline capabilities; so much so that users might not even tell the difference. Even cooler is now you can install apps from the web onto your phone like a native app. The web is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and you should be taking advantage of this.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelsolati/,@MichaelSolati,,,,js_michael.png,https://youtu.be/MNkeHzckoJk,progressive web app

No,beyond js,Colby Fayock,Front End Developer,Element 84,,,,Put Down Javascript - How Building Fundamentals Will Help You Level Up,"A growing trend in the front end world is the idea that you can dive right in to Javascript and succeed. For better or worse you probably can, but you’re building on top of a fragile foundation. We’ll talk about how you can level up your Javascript by getting back to the basics of HTML and CSS.

Seasoned and beginner alike, developers have a habit of jumping right into a framework or new technology that makes a lot of promises while also glazing over important fundamentals that without, tend to hold back a website or application’s potential. Without some basic knowledge of HTML, you might inadvertently exclude people from learning about your company through your website due to poor accessibility. Lacking an understanding or simply being afraid of CSS, you might be more prone to add unnecessary libraries on top of libraries that just add to the weight of the page, impacting how quickly your app can load.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/colbyfayock/,@colbyfayock,,,,js_colby.png,https://youtu.be/nn-4BzMd0Eg,building fundamentals

However, my algorithm runs through all the pixels of the canvas, which takes a long time: more than 2 seconds to render a map on a fullHD screen.

From C++ to JS,"C / C++ is known to be a very powerful language, due to its performance is often used to develop game engines, embedded systems, and desktop apps. This talk is about how to integrate C++ code with Web Assembly in JS projects and why we would want to do that.

Back to the old school days, I remember writing a lot of C/C++, as my primary language, for a lot of academic projects. C /C++ is known to be a very powerful language. Thanks to C/C++’s performance, it is often used to develop game engines, embedded systems, desktop apps, etc. Nowadays, It sounds a little weird to do web development with languages like C/C++, Prolog, Perl, and many other good languages that are not considered web languages.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmarket/,,,,,js_alex.png,https://youtu.be/e84JsH0HHM0,"back to the future,c++"

It's one of the most common questions devs have pertaining to MongoDB. And the answer is, it depends. This is because document databases have a rich vocabulary that is capable of expressing data relationships in more nuanced ways than SQL.

There are many things to consider when picking a schema. is your app read or write heavy? What data is frequently accessed together? What are your performance considerations? How will your data set grow and scale?",https://www.linkedin.com/in/joekarlsson/,@JoeKarlsson1,,,,js_joe.png,https://youtu.be/tYNaXn2wJJo,mongodb schema design

Design tools are fast and amazing tools for thought, but for a host of reasons are limited to creating drawings rather than production assets. Developers must instead re-create surfaces from scratch, by hand, using code (often heavily using tools like the Devtools CSS inspector, the closest thing developers have to a design tool). This inevitably leads to discrepancies and back-and-forth with the design team, and ultimately two sources of truth that are never truly in sync.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/yzhang/,@plasmicapp,,,,js_yang.png,https://youtu.be/BdCwJiHlDnE,react frontend

We’ll talk about the impact maps can have and the challenges in developing these tools with Javascript and the JAMstack.

​Working on building apps and interfaces is as challenging as it is rewarding. On one hand, being able to work on tools scientists use every day and giving first responders the ability to help save lives is rewarding in itself, but getting to those goals is technically challenging considering building an application with useful map features, making it intuitive, and having infrastructure behind it that gives the map the features needed to be useful in the first place.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/colbyfayock/,@colbyfayock,,,,js_colby.png,https://youtu.be/zXcUTZsfT9s,"maps,impact,react,jamstack"
