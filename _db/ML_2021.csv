Yes,,Antje Barth,Senior Developer Advocate - AI & ML,Amazon Web Services,,,,From idea to production: Automate your machine learning workflows with pipelines,"Developing high-quality machine learning models involve many steps. We typically start with exploring and preparing our data. We experiment with different algorithms and parameters. We spend time training and tuning our model until the model meets our quality metrics, and is ready to be deployed into production. Orchestrating and automating workflows across each step of this model development process can take months of coding.

In this session, I show you how to create, automate, and manage machine learning workflows using Amazon SageMaker Pipelines. We will create a reusable NLP model training pipeline to prepare data, store the features in a feature store, fine-tune a BERT model, and deploy the model into production if it passes our defined quality metrics.

No,getting started,Milecia McGregor,Developer Advocate,Iterative,,,,Convolutional Neural Networks in Action,"Neural networks are great for complex data sets, but some sets have more features to figure out than others. Many times these features are initialized based on heuristics and they have to be tuned as the model returns predictions. With convolutional neural networks, the model tunes the features for itself.

In this talk, you will learn some use cases for CNNs, how they work under the hood, and how you can create a CNN in Python. You’ll be able to see how convolutions and max-pooling help decrease the amount of pre-processing you have to do. By the end of the talk, you should have a good understanding of the basics of CNNs and how to implement them.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/milecia/,@FlippedCoding,,,,ml_milecia.png,https://youtu.be/MUOrumcZvKo,Convolutional Neural Networks,24
No,getting started,Gajendra Deshpande,Assistant Professor,KLS Gogte Institute of Technology,,,,Multilingual Natural Language Processing using Python,"Natural Language Processing(NLP) is an interesting and challenging field. It becomes even more interesting and challenging when we take into consideration more than one human language. when we perform an NLP on a single language there is a possibility that the interesting insights from another human language might be missed out. The interesting and valuable information may be available in other human languages such as Spanish, Chinese, French, Hindi, and other major languages of the world. Also, the information may be available in various formats such as text, images, audio, and video.

In this talk, I will discuss techniques and methods that will help perform NLP tasks on multi-source and multilingual information. The talk begins with an introduction to natural language processing and its concepts. Then it addresses the challenges with respect to multilingual and multi-source NLP. Next, I will discuss various techniques and tools to extract information from audio, video, images, and other types of files using PyScreenshot, SpeechRecognition, Beautiful Soup, and PIL packages. Also, extracting the information from web pages and source code using pytessaract. Next, I will discuss concepts such as translation and transliteration that help to bring the information into a common language format. Once the language is in a common language format it becomes easy to perform NLP tasks. Next, I will explain with the help of a code walkthrough generating a summary from multi-source and multi-lingual information into a specific language using spacy and stanza packages.

No,main,Eduardo Dixo,Senior Data Scientist,Continental,,,,Object Detection using Transformers and CNNs - A Drone Case Study,"Drones with mounted cameras provide significant advantages when compared to fixed cameras for object detection and visual tracking scenarios. Given their recent adoption in the wild and late advances in computer vision models, many aerial datasets have been introduced.

In this talk, we’ll explore recent advances in object detection, comparing the challenges of natural images with those recorded by drones. Given the successes achieved by pretraining image classifiers on large datasets, and transferring the learned representations, a set of object detectors fine-tuned on publicly available aerial datasets will be presented and explained. We’ll highlight existing libraries that mitigate the cost of training large models from scratch, by including pretrained model weights and model variants found in the literature. Both Convolutional Neural Networks and the newly developed Transformers applied to vision will be covered and compared, outlining the main features of each architecture. The presentation will be accompanied by code snippets for aiding understanding and delivering practical examples.

This is aimed at a general audience familiar with Python. Knowledge of Computer Vision is a plus but not a requirement as we’ll introduce the necessary concepts. We’ll ground the presented model architectures and libraries on the task of object detection applied to aerial datasets and demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods are within everyone’s reach.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-dixo/,@Eduardo_dixo,,,Conf42 Machine Learning 2021 Slides - Eduardo Dixo.pdf,ml_eduardo.png,https://youtu.be/1s-hXnjHEHI,Object Detection Transformers CNNs Drone Case Study,28

No,tools,Laura Ham,Community Solution Engineer,SeMI Technologies,,,,Search through your data with Weaviate and out-of-the-box machine learning models,"This talk is an introduction to the vector search engine [Weaviate](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate). You will learn how storing data using vectors enables semantic search and automatic data classification. Topics like the underlying vector storage mechanism and how the pre-trained language vectorization model enables this are touched. In addition, this presentation consists of live demos to show the power of Weaviate and how you can get started with your own datasets. No prior technical knowledge is required; all concepts are illustrated with real use case examples and live demos. 

Most of all data is unstructured. Additionally, data is often stored without context, meaning and relation to concepts in the real world. This means that all this data is difficult to index, classify and search through. While this is traditionally solved by manual effort or expensive machine learning models, Weaviate takes another approach to this problem. Weaviate is a vector search engine, which stores data as vectors and automatically adds context and meaning to new data. This enables to search through the data without using exact matching keywords. Moreover, data can be automatically classified. 

Weaviate is completely [open source](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate), has a built-in machine learning model, has a graph-like data model, completely API-based and is cloud-native. Weaviate uses a GraphQL API next to RESTful endpoints to interact with the data in an intuitive manner. Additionally, Python, Go, Java and JavaScript clients are available to facilitate interaction between Weaviate and your applications. GraphQL and client examples will be shown in the presentation.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-ham/,@laura_hamham,,,Conf42 Machine Learning 2021 Slides - Laura Ham.pdf,ml_laura.png,https://youtu.be/e2jeukR8ZaA,Weaviate out-of-the-box machine learning models,13
