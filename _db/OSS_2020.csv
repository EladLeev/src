Yes,fastapi,Sebastián Ramírez,Creator,FastAPI,,,,Intro to FastAPI,"FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. From simple code you get automatic API docs, validation, and serialization.

Your API will support open standards like OpenAPI and JSON Schema by default. And your code will have autocompletion and type checks in your editor everywhere, even for your own JSON request data. It has integrated tools to handle auth with OAuth2, a powerful but simple dependency injection system, and more. FastAPI is currently used by Microsoft, Uber, Netflix, and many others for different tools and projects.",,@tiangolo,,,,oss_sebastian.png,https://youtu.be/syf6ZSiRSbw
No,showcase,Ludovic Dubost,Founder & CEO,XWiki SAS,,,,CryptPad: The Encrypted Collaboration Suite,"As users and organizations we are more and more relying on technology for everything we do, whether it is our personal usage or our business usage.
How much do we need to trust our technology providers to handle our data with care ? 

Is there any way we can be more in control of our data ?

The CryptPad project is being build based on a new approach, end-to-end encryption, raising the bar of data security and privacy, while providing a high usability and many collaboration features, including real-time collaboration.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/ldubost/,@ldubost,,,https://580d9e60-4356-475f-aa71-085d1b84e2cf.filesusr.com/ugd/f3e158_e6815ae60d2d42338d8c8d585ae20830.pdf,oss_ludovic.png,https://youtu.be/N3NAlHlLv5I
No,showcase,Josh Stella,CTO,Fugue,,,,Chaos Engineering For Cloud Security: Think like a hacker,"Cloud security is a software engineering problem⁠ - not a traditional security problem. This talk will demonstrate an advanced cloud misconfiguration exploit to understand how to protect against such attacks using architecture best practices.

The cloud changed the way hackers operate: Rather than targeting an organization and then searching for vulnerabilities to exploit, they now use automation to scan the internet looking for cloud misconfigurations to exploit, and then use IAM like a network to move laterally, find data, and extract it. We’ve graduated from simple misconfiguration mistakes to techniques bad actors are using today to breach data out from under the most advanced cloud security teams⁠—often without detection.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-stella-949a9711/,@joshtella,,,https://580d9e60-4356-475f-aa71-085d1b84e2cf.filesusr.com/ugd/f3e158_055bd5b6d23f41a2b3e17db5927b12a6.pdf,oss_josh.png,https://youtu.be/AtqFi-f9r54
No,showcase,Clément Aubin,Developer,XWiki SAS,,,,Bringing ActivityPup to knowledge management with XWiki,"XWiki is a wiki-based platform focused on storing knowledge in a structured manner, and is extensible.
After an introduction to XWiki, we'll focus on how ActivityPub can help you supercharge your collaboration by connecting XWiki to other platforms.​

ActivityPub is an open, decentralized social networking protocol which provides a federated server-to-server API for delivering notifications and content. The integration of such protocols greatly ease platform intercommunication, allowing content to flow through different platforms over a structured protocol.This talk aims to provide a glimpse at the possibilities offered by the integration of ActivityPub within knowledge-oriented platforms, focusing particularly on XWiki, which recently developed its own ActivityPub integration.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/aubincleme/,@aubincleme,,,https://580d9e60-4356-475f-aa71-085d1b84e2cf.filesusr.com/ugd/f3e158_5b6a872920934012aa990d40507e9d85.pdf,oss_clement.png,https://youtu.be/eK1krh81z_A
No,showcase,Sven Al Hamad,Coder,Webiny,,,,Webiny - your open-source foundation for building serverless full-stack applications,"Serverless infrastructure is changing the way how applications are architected and coded. However, today there isn't a framework that you can use to help you build and architect your serverless application. Webiny is here to solve that problem. It's your serverless foundation.

Webiny is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. Webiny is coded 100% in JS, with React.js on the frontend, and Node.js on the backend. Webiny gives you a blueprint to code your first serverless application, but without the pains of figuring out how to do proper routing, SSR, a file system, ACL, DB connection pooling and much more - these things behave differently when using a serverless infrastructure. Essentially Webiny removes the risk of adopting serverless.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/svenalhamad/,@SvenAlHamad,,,,oss_sven.png,https://youtu.be/jMPbo7rkKbA
No,showcase,Tom Payne,Creator,chezmoi.io,,,,"chezmoi: Manage your dotfiles across multiple machines, securely","Another dotfile manager? chezmoi aims to solve the dotfile management problem Once And For All(tm), allowing keep your personal configuration files in sync wherever you login. It's familiar, fast, flexible, full featured, secure, easy to install, and runs everywhere. Join this talk to find out more!

In just 10 minutes, we'll quickly justify the problem that chezmoi tries to solve, and then dive in to a fast demonstration of its key features to help you decide if chezmoi is useful to you. We'll do a quick comparison with other dotfile managers, and spend one slide on chezmoi's technical choices, before leaving you with clear next steps to get started with chezmoi yourself.",,,,,,oss_tom.png,https://youtu.be/JrCMCdvoMAw
No,showcase,Josh Stella,CTO,Fugue,,,,Addressing Cloud Security with Open Policy Agent (OPA),"OPA is an open source policy as code framework and toolset which can be used to validate policy compliance of cloud infrastructure environments. Learn how OPA works, how cloud engineering and dev teams can leverage it and other open source tools to prevent deployment of resource misconfigurations.

The challenges of building and modifying at-scale cloud infrastructure environments led to the development of infrastructure as code, and now the challenges of managing the security and compliance of those environments has led to policy as code. Cloud environments are simply too vast, complex and dynamic to address with traditional security and compliance approaches such as manual audits and checklists. Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source policy as code framework and toolset that’s a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).",https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-stella-949a9711/,@joshstella,,,https://580d9e60-4356-475f-aa71-085d1b84e2cf.filesusr.com/ugd/f3e158_882b00295eac4223aba51c76ae9f7829.pdf,oss_josh.png,https://youtu.be/A-39YWIXyag
