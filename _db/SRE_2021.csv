Yes,,Robert Ross,CEO,FireHydrant,,,,Pragmatic Incident Response: 5 lessons learned from failures,"Incident response is overwhelming. So where do you start? There's a lot of advice out there, but it's mostly theories that aren't taking reality into account. So how do you get a process in place that actually works and scales? 

In this session, FireHydrant CEO and Co-Founder, Robert Ross, will share stories (good and bad) from his experience as an SRE and what 5 pragmatic tips he’s learned along the way on building a successful incident response process.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobby-tables/,@bobbytables,,,,sre_robert.png,,"pragmatic,incident response",
No,main,Julie Gunderson,Senior Reliability Advocate,Gremlin,,,,Reducing Trauma in Production with SLOs and Chaos Engineering,"Customer experience is the responsibility of the entire team. Many organizations leave reliability up to the SRE team, however reliability should be built in from the very beginning. 

In this talk Mandi and Julie will discuss what Service Levels Objectives are, why they are important to the organization, and how to define and set them. Going beyond SLOs, attendees will learn what Chaos Engineering is and practical ways to ensure compliance and resilience with best practices. We’ll show you how to focus your goals and error budgets with examples that will lead to reliability and improved user experience.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliegunderson/,@julie_gund,,,,sre_julie.png,,"trauma,production,SLOs,chaos engineering",
No,main,Mandi Walls,DevOps Advocate,PagerDuty,,,,Improve Your Automation to Reduce Toil,"In the course of your day as an SRE, your knowledge and expertise are in high demand. You can’t do every task every person in your org needs from you without the help of comprehensive automation. 

Automation can be tricky. Some systems aren’t built with automation in mind, but assume that a human being will be there to keep an eye on things and fix errors on the fly, and we can’t be everywhere when there’s too much to do.

Plus, you want to provide access to automation for the right folks and keep a record of when the tools were used. 

In this talk, we’ll cover some things to keep in mind when you’re building out your automation library, characteristics of good automation, and give you a look at PagerDuty Rundeck, a platform that will help you share your expertise with other folks in your organization.

Build automation that works for you and gives you your time back!

No,main,Chris Riley,Senior Technology Advocate,Splunk,,,,"Incident Response, Incident Management, and Alerts - Where do they fit in CloudOps","Responding to incidents is not just about wiring up the right tools, it's also a strategy and process to know how to respond, how to record details of incidents, and how to learn from them after everything has been resolved. There has been a lot of confusion about the relationship of incident response to incident management, and alerting. In this session we will talk about the differences and the best practices for these key processes in healthy cloud operations environments. Expect to learn in this session.

1.) What is an alert and how does it feed incidents
2.) What is the difference between incident response (IR), and incident management (IM)
3.) What are the best practices for IR and IM tooling
4.) How incidents are being handled in modern dev environments

We will also talk about on-call scheduling, shift-left, and how machine learning supports incident response strategies.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/cloudproductandmarketing/,@hoardinginfo,,,,sre_chris.png,,"incident response,incident management,alerts,CloudOps",
No,main,Pranjal Deo,Engineering Program Manager,Google,,,,Engineering Reliable Mobile Applications,"""##  Why Mobile and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)?
* Mobile is nonuniform and uncontrollable
* SRE responsibilities differ in critical ways from infrastructure or server-side application reliability engineering
* Focus on where your end users are (i.e. today many users access services through mobile applications)
* Specific challenges of mobile
        * Monitoring
        * Release management
        * Incident management

## Case studies
* Doodle outage, etc.

## Future of SRE for Mobile
*  Visibility into mobile application performance
* Find and react to issues before the user does
* Measure SLIs throughout the product stack (from client to service)""",https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranjal-deo-56840230/,,,,,sre_pranjal.png,,"reliable,mobile applications",
No,main,Dewan Ahmed,Developer Advocate,Red Hat,,,,Deploy N applications to N clusters using AppSet,"As the scaling needs grow, you have to deploy your application to more than one Kubernetes cluster. How about deploying multiple applications across multiple clusters? This talk covers Argo CD + ApplicationSets that allow you to manage deployments of a large number of applications, repositories, or clusters, all from a single Kubernetes resource.

Starting with a brief introduction to GitOps and Argo CD, you will learn about the challenges of having to use new manifest files every time you want to deploy to another cluster. With Argo CD's Application resource, users are limited to deploying from a single Git repository to a single cluster/namespace. In contrast, you'll learn in this talk, the ApplicationSet resource uses templates, and automated generation of template parameters, to allow you to manage many Argo CD Applications simultaneously from multiple Git repositories. The demo will feature OpenShift GitOps which bundles Argo CD, ApplicationSets and other tools, to enable teams to implement GitOps workflows for cluster configuration and application delivery. Although some knowledge about Kubernetes and GitOps will help, the demo will explain the concepts in action. ApplicationSets Generator demos will show how your applications can be deployed and managed across single/multiple clusters from one or more Git repositories.

You will leave the talk with the necessary resources and knowledge on Argo CD, ApplicationSets and OpenShift GitOps, and learn how these tools can help you manage large numbers of applications through templating and automation.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/diahmed/,@DewanAhmed,,,,sre_dewan.png,,"deploy,applications,clusters,appset",
No,main,Dmitry Vinnik,Developer Advocate,Facebook,,,,"Fixing Broken Windows: Dealing with Legacy Systems, Poor Quality and Gaps","We all encountered a “Broken Window” theory in practice. The original idea was that if someone breaks a window in a neighbourhood and this window is not repaired right away, the entire area will start getting messier at an accelerated rate.

The same theory is also true for Software Development. How many times have you looked at a legacy system with no code coverage, and decided not to write any tests because """"this is how we do things here""""? These bad practices behave just like those """"Broken Windows."""" They cause our code to degrade and become unusable.

In this talk, we discuss how to break away from bad development practices and how to address major gaps in your legacy and current systems. We look at ways to successfully lead-by-example and to introduce refactoring culture into your team and organization. We cover tips and tricks that help to improve the development culture and to emphasize the general health of the codebase.
