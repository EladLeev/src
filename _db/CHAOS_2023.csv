yes,,Pablo Chacin,Technical Lead Chaos Engineering,Grafana Labs / K6,,,,Shifting left chaos testing,"We all agree reliability is one of the most important features of any application. Then, why are we not routinely including reliability as part of the testing process? Why have we “shifted it to the right” relying (maybe too much) in chaos testing in production? Can we shift it back to the left?",https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablochacin/,@pablochacin,,,Conf42 Chaos Engineering 2023 - Pablo Chacin.pdf,ce_pablo_chacin.png,https://youtu.be/Lxtr9h0Xkqc,"shifting,left,chaos,testing",15
yes,,Benjamin Wilms,Co-Founder & CEO,Steadybit,,,,Reliability in the Face of Uncertainty,"Today's success of businesses depends on their systems' stability and reliability. Downtimes are painful: They cause you to lose the trust of your customers and cost your business money. Providing reliable services to your customers is essential to success. Despite the best efforts, the one sure thing about undesirable events like outages is that they will always occur, but the moment chooses you.

Waiting and hoping an outage will not occur is not a strategy.

yes,,Uma Mukkara,Head of Chaos Engineering,Harness,,,,Continuous Resilience with Chaos Engineering,"Chaos Engineering has been helping SREs in improving resilience for a while. The adoption has been growing so much that we are now seeing more patterns of usage of Chaos Engineering and one of them is use of chaos experiments across the board in the software delivery process. In this talk, I introduce the details and best practices of the pattern of developing and using chaos experiments in CD pipelines and Production by both developers and SREs through a collaborative that gives rise to a new concept in DevOps called Continuous Resilience. With the continuous resilience pattern in place, there is an opportunity to resolve the traditional issues in the implementation of chaos engineering such as low chaos coverage, dependency on developers by SREs etc. ",https://www.linkedin.com/in/uma-mukkara/,@Uma_Mukkara,,,Conf42 Chaos Engineering 2023 - Uma Mukkara.pdf,ce_uma_mukkara.png,https://youtu.be/8bUiFaPqRj8,"continuous,resilience",45

We all know that Software Development Lifecycle can be a complicated process. We are usually good at identifying bottlenecks and we have tools like Value Stream Mapping to visualize them. We are often able to remove some of the berries by adjusting the process itself. There are also some impediments that can only be removed by building trust across teams. During my talk, I will shine the light on how to build trust between these teams, break the silos and accelerate the delivery of our product.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaszmanugiewicz/,,,,Conf42 Chaos Engineering 2023 - Tomasz Manugiewicz.pdf,ce_tomasz_manugiewicz.png,https://youtu.be/gRbhNHO0jRk,"trust,driven,development,devops,transformation,practice.",
