no,deep dive,David Oyinbo,dev.davexoyinbo@gmail.com,Senior Frontend Developer,HeySummit,,,,Unlocking the Power of Rust: Building Safe and Fast Software for the Future,"Rust is a modern systems programming language that is quickly gaining popularity due to its ability to build safe, fast, and reliable software. In this talk, we will explore the key features of Rust that make it such a powerful language for building the software of the future.
We will start by discussing the Rust type system, which is one of the language's most important features. The Rust type system helps to prevent errors at compile time, which can save developers a lot of time and frustration. We will also discuss Rust's ownership and borrowing system, which helps to ensure that memory is managed safely and efficiently.

Next, we will look at some of the performance features of Rust. Rust is a compiled language, which means that it can be very fast. We will discuss some of the techniques that Rust uses to optimize code, such as its borrow checker and its efficient memory management system.

Finally, we will look at some of the real-world applications of Rust. Rust is used to build a wide variety of software, including operating systems, databases, and web servers. We will discuss some of the projects that are using Rust to build the software of the future.

By the end of this talk, you will have a good understanding of the key features of Rust and how they can be used to build safe, fast, and reliable software. You will also be familiar with some of the real-world applications of Rust.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-bayode-oyinbo/,,,,,David Oyinbo_rustlang.png,,"building,safe,fast,software,future",
