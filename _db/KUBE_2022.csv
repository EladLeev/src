Yes,,Arsh Sharma,Dev Experience,Okteto,,,,Did We Actually Make Developers Happy by Shifting to Microservices?,"Containerization made us realize that it made more sense to break our monolithic applications into a bunch of smaller microservices that interacted with each other. We changed how we deploy our applications and architect our applications, but we STILL had developers continuing to write code using the same old tools they did before. This introduced frictions in the development process:

- developers had to spend a lot of time configuring things before they could get to the ""code writing"" phase
- being able to accurately mimic the production setup during development became almost impossible
- the feedback loop became very slow due to CI pipelines and staging environments being the only way to be able to test changes in a production setup

This talk will go into the details of these problems and analyze how they lead to a bad developer experience when working on microservices-based applications. After discussing these problems, the talk will also go over the current attempts we as an industry are making to solve these issues and make lives easier for developers.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/arsh4/,@RinkiyaKeDad,,,,kube_arsh_sharma.png,,"shifting,microservices",
No,getting started,Rob Richardson,Developer Advocate,Jetpack.io,,,,Horizontal Autoscaling with Kubernetes,"Now that the app is running in Kubernetes, how do we scale it to meet demand? What metric should we use? CPU? Requests? something else? Let's dig into why we auto-scale, and how we auto-scale with lots of examples. Finally we'll look at potential pitfalls and gotchas like how to scale to 0 and how to avoid scaling too big for your budget. Come learn how to scale with Kubernetes.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/erobrich/,@rob_rich,,,,kube_rob_richardson.png,,"horizontal,autoscaling",
No,getting started,Abhishek Gupta,Principal Developer Advocate,AWS,,,,Building Kubernetes apps? How about removing YAML and writing Go code instead!,"The combination of Containers and Kubernetes has emerged as a de-facto standard for packaging, deploying and orchestrating applications. But the (harsh?) reality is that Kubernetes app development workflows and specifications are dominated by YAML config which become harder to manage and maintain over time. Solutions such as Helm, Kustomize etc. help relieve some of the pain, but at the end of the day, they too are YAML-centric.

What if you could just write Go code to define Kubernetes applications? Well, cdk8s (short form for Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes) is an open-source CNCF project that allows developers to build ""reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs""

This talk will provide an overview of cdk8s and it's workflow, how to define your first cdk8s application and building reusable components called ""constructs"". You will also see ""cdk8s in action"" with some live-coding and demos! All of this will be done using Go, which has first-class support in cdk8s.

The attendees can expect to walk away with:
1. Understanding the concept of ""Infrastructure-Is-Code"" in the context of Kubernetes
2. How to leverage Go for writing infrastructure code for Kubernetes based applications
3. Learn about an end-to-end scenario of how to practically use cdk8s to define and deploy apps to a Kubernetes cluster",https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhirockzz/,@abhi_tweeter,,,,kube_abhishek_gupta.png,,"building,apps,removing,yaml,writing,go,code",

No,security,Jose Manuel Ortega,Freelance Security Researcher,,,,,Sharing secret keys in Docker containers and K8s,"In this talk I will show how to save secret keys in Docker containers and K8s in production and best practices for saving and securing distribution of secrets. With Docker and k8s secrets we can manage information related to keys that are needed at runtime but cannot be exposed in the Docker image or source code repository.

These could be the main talking points:

1.Challenges of security and secret keys in containers

2.Best practices for saving and securing distribution of secrets in Docker Containers

3.Managing secrets in Kubernetes using volumes and sealed-secrets

4.Other tools for distributing secrets in containers like Hashicorp Vault and KeyWhiz",https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmortega1/,@jmortegac,,,,kube_jose_manuel_ortega.png,,"sharing,secret,keys,docker,containers,k8s",

Everyone’s homelab is different and the reasons for building one are just as different. No matter why you built it, everyone should always be thinking least privilege. The problem is that least privilege, especially with Kubernetes, is hard. It doesn’t have to be. In this talk you will see what can happen when you don’t implement least privilege, how to configure roles, and how to use them. We will look at how to do this with a number of tools and end with a quick look at doing everything with Infra which is 100% open source. You will leave the session with actionable next steps to get single sign on up and running in minutes at home using only open source tools.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/technovangelist/,@technovangelist,,,,kube_matt_williams.png,,"homelab,sso",

No,deep dive,Shahar Azulay,Co-Founder & CEO,groundcover,,,,Cloud-Native Observability at Scale: Why Distributed Architectures are Here to Stay,"Gaining affordable, in-depth insights is always the first observability task of engineering teams. When you take a conventional, monolith-friendly monitoring architecture and try to graft it onto a distributed, cloud-native app problems arise - you can no longer have both.Centralized architectures, where raw data is being trucked all the way to the observability provider before being digested for insights (such as metrics), have started to weigh heavy on their teams - usually by way of immense burdening costs. Suddenly to get the desired logs, metrics and traces, teams had loads more data to collect, since a monolithic single app now gave way to a complex array of microservices. A new breed of observability architectures are out there and it’s time we all get acquainted. These architectures collect and digest raw data in a distributed manner, where the data actually lies. They break the link between the data volume monitored and the volume of data being sent, handled, and stored to support in-depth monitoring insights - reducing costs, network usage and irrelevant data collection. We’ll delve into a real life  implementation of such an approach, showing how it can redefine modern observability today, and allow sustainable scale in the future.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/shahar-azulay-54156bb4/,,,,,kube_shahar_azulay.png,,"cloud-native,observability,distributed,architectures",
No,deep dive,Ed Shee,Head of Developer Relations,Seldon,,,,Deploying Machine Learning Models on Kubernetes,"Until recently, the data science / machine learning field has been pretty immature in its adoption of DevOps tools and processes. That's now changing rapidly as engineering teams realise that, in order to gain any value from their ML models, they need to get them into production.

In this talk, Ed will introduce the open source Seldon Core library, build a model using popular machine learning tools and deploy it to Kubernetes to handle production traffic. 

You will learn how to turn an ML model into a production microservice that handles REST/gRPC traffic, how to use complex model deployment techniques and how to monitor both the infrastructure and the models themselves, spotting drift and outliers as they take place.

No,deep dive,Shivay Lamba,CTO,DarkHorse,,,,Supercharge your Kubernetes AI deployments with Web Assembly,"Machine Learning inference (though what we talk about can be applied to other computationally intensive tasks) is often a computationally intensive task and could greatly benefit from the speed of WebAssembly. What if I told you, that you could improve the performance of your application deployed on Linux containers.
Enter Wasm and Kubernetes.
This talk starts off by introducing the audience to WebAssembly (Wasm) and how they could make use of the speed and security among others of Wasm for their deployments. Another problem we face is that the standard WebAssembly provides very limited access to the native OS and hardware, such as multi-core CPUs, GPU, or TPUs which is not ideal for the kind of systems we target. The talk also shows how one could use the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) to get security, portability, and native speed for Machine Learning models. The talk then shows how one can use Krustlet to run Wasm on Kubernetes with a demo of deploying a model while also talking about necessary considerations while doing so.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivaylamba/,@howdevelop,,,,kube_shivay_lamba.png,,"ai,deployments,web,assembly",

No,lessons learned,David Joyce,Principal Data Engineer,Spectrum Labs,,,,Building Scalable Data Pipelines With Argo Workflows,"At Spectrum Labs, our deep learning models are trained and validated against large data sets that can only be processed in a distributed manner. Data Scientists require the ability to invoke batch jobs as part of the the model development lifecycle, and these jobs must run in a scalable, fault-tolerant manner.

Argo Workflows is chosen as our data pipeline framework as it provides a container-native workflow engine that allows us to build on our existing Kubernetes deployment. We use Apache Spark as our distributed processing engine, which we deploy and manage ourselves on Kubernetes. The integration of these 2 technologies provides us with a batch job framework to meet our Data Scientists needs.

In this session, we will provide an overview of Argo Workflows and how we use it within Spectrum Labs to execute Spark jobs that process datasets that contain over 100 million records. We will demo our current pipelines and describe how we have built a framework that allows us to deploy a scalable Spark application with only a few lines of configuration. We will also provide an overview of Argo Events which allows us to orchestrate our pipelines in an automated manner. Lastly, we will discuss some of the advantages and challenges of using the Argo framework.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-joyce-55599069/,,,,,kube_david_joyce.png,,"scalable,data,pipelines,argo,workflows",
