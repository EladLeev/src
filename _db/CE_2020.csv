Yes,,Russ Miles,CEO,ChaosIQ,,,,How to be WRONG,"Being wrong is often seen as the WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN(tm), especially when you’re building business-critical applications and services.
​
But the increased velocity of modern software development, plus the increased need for our systems to be resilient, reliable, and RIGHT has increased the pressure on developers exponentially. Never before have software owners had such an opportunity, or the power, to BE WRONG!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/russmiles/,@russmiles,,,ce2020_how_to_be_wrong.pdf,ce_russ.png,https://youtu.be/7k6gYZa6BVg,how to be wrong

No,chaos,Long Zhang,PhD Student in Computer Science,KTH Royal Institute of Technology,,,,Application-Level Chaos Engineering in JVM,"During the talk, I will introduce the main research work we did recently on chaos engineering. We focus a lot on application-level chaos engineering in JVM.

For example, ChaosMachine provides unique and actionable analysis on exception-handling capabilities in production, at the level of try-catch blocks. TripleAgent combines monitoring, perturbation, and failure-obliviousness for automated resilience improvement, at the level of methods.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/gluckzhang/,@GluckZhang,,,ce2020_application_level_ce_in_jvm.pdf,ce_long.png,https://youtu.be/B0zf4a9T8jo,jvm
No,chaos,Vilas Veeraraghavan,Director of Engineering,Walmart Labs,,,,Journey To Resilience: Building the Ramp to accelerate The Adoption of Chaos Engineering Practices,"Chaos engineering has come a long way from its early days at Netflix. Its importance is no longer questioned in the community but as it has gone mainstream, teams quickly learn that adoption is not a given.
 
In this talk, we talk about the challenges that we encountered at Walmart and the techniques used to break through them.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/vilas-veeraraghavan/,@vsqr,,,ce2020_journey_to_resilience.pdf,ce_vilas.png,https://youtu.be/4VosMeJlvWA,"resilience,adoption"
No,chaos,Joyce Lin,Developer Advocate Lead,Postman,,,,Who is responsible for Chaos?,"If you’re thinking of starting a chaos program, you might be wondering which job functions are typically responsible for managing chaos within their organizations.

This talk will look across a number of companies to determine who historically initiates chaos programs, as well as reveal new trends in this space.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/joyce-lin/,@PetuniaGray,,,ce2020_who_is_responsible_for_chaos.pdf,ce_joyce.png,https://youtu.be/ZTbrf47mCEU,who is responsible for chaos
No,chaos,Yury Nino Roa,DevOps Engineer,Aval Digital Labs,,,,Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure,"Practicing Chaos Engineering and reproducing outages have taught us that the culture of postmortems must be open and blameless. That is difficult, in part, due to the social stigma associated with publicly acknowledging the contributions of persons to outages.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurynino/,@yurynino,,,ce2020_postmortem_culture_learning_from_failure.pdf,ce_yury.png,https://youtu.be/JtLrlDNdJzg,postmortem culture
No,chaos,Luka Kladaric,Founder & Chaos Management,Sekura,,,,Shipping Quality Software in Hostile Environments,"Everyone loves features, right? Product loves features. Management loves features. The board loves features. Features are what make the users use and the investors invest, right? They certainly make the media pay attention.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukakladaric/,@kll,,,ce2020_shipping_quality_software_in_hostile_environments.pdf,ce_luka.png,https://youtu.be/nApPLgPfPYM,"quality software,hostile environments"
No,chaos,Andrew Pruski,SQL Server DBA ,Channel Advisor,,,,Chaos Engineering for SQL Server,"In this session we’ll look at how Chaos Engineering can be implemented with regard to SQL Server. SQL has various different high availability solutions but can we be sure that they’ll react as expected to a real world issue? Has the HA architecture only ever been tested in a planned maintenance window?

We’ll explore SQL Server’s built-in high availability features and take a look at Kubernetes, a brand new platform for SQL Server.

We’ll also have some fun by looking at KubeInvaders, a chaos engineering tool for Kubernetes…using Space Invaders!",https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewpruski/,@dbafromthecold,,,ce2020_ce_for_sql_server.pdf,ce_andrew.png,https://youtu.be/HCy3sjMRvlI,sql server
No,chaos,Adrian Hornsby,"Principal Technologist, Architecture",Amazon Web Services (AWS),,,,Chaos Engineering: Getting out of the Starting Blocks,"Architectures are growing increasingly distributed and hard to understand. As a result, software systems have become extremely difficult to debug and test, which increases the risk of failure. With these new challenges, chaos engineering ha become attractive to many organizations as a mechanism for underling the behavior of systems under expected circumstances.

Whilst interest is growing, few have managed to build sustainable chaos engineering practices. In this talk, I will review the state of chaos engineering, the issues customers are facing, based on my learning as an AWS Solution Architect and Technologist focusing on Chaos Engineering and explain why I started to build tools to help with failure injection.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/hornsby/,@adhorn,,,ce2020_getting_out_of_the_starting_blocks.pdf,ce_adrian.png,https://youtu.be/WGAogib0NZw,getting out of the starting blocks
No,chaos,Uma Mukkara,CEO,Chaos Native,,,,Cloud Native Chaos Engineering,"The cloud native approach has taken the DevOps world by a pleasant surprise by the welcome adoption of Kubernetes across all categories - from Developers to SREs to VP of digital transformation. As the huge mass of legacy applications move Cloud-Native platforms, an important problem arises. How do SREs make sure the systems do not have weaknesses and have the required level of resilience? A well thought out chaos engineering methodology is the right answer. And for a large number of fast-changing applications and infrastructure, finding the right set of chaos experiments and identifying if the impact of chaos has resulted in showing up a weakness in the system is almost an impossible task.

In Cloud Native Chaos engineering, the developers develop chaos tests as an extension of the development process. These tests are developed using standard Kubernetes Custom Resources or CRs so that they are easier to manipulate according to the environment. These chaos experiments are groomed in CI pipelines and finally published in the Chaos Hub so that they are available to SREs using the Cloud-Native applications in production. SREs use such chaos experiments of various microservices to schedule chaos in a random fashion to find weaknesses in their deployments, which leads to increased reliability.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/uma-mukkara/,@Uma_Mukkara,,,ce2020_cloud_native_ce.pdf,ce_uma.png,https://youtu.be/KUyIjjgYhl0,cloud native
Yes,,Matty Stratton,DevOps Advocate ,PagerDuty,,,,Psychology of Chaos Engineering,"Chaos Engineering, failure injection, and similar practices have verified benefits to the resilience of systems and infrastructure. But can they provide similar resilience to teams and people? What are the effects and impacts on the humans involved in the systems? This talk will delve into both positive and negative outcomes to all the groups of people involved - including users, engineers, product, and business owners.

Using case studies from organizations where chaos engineering has been implemented, we will explore the changes in attitude that these practices create. This talk will include a brief overview of chaos engineering practices for unfamiliar members of the audience, but the main focus will be on human elements. I will discuss successful implementations, as well as challenges faced in teams where chaos was a “success” from a technical perspective, but contained negative impact for the people involved.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattstratton/,@mattstratton,,,ce2020_the_psychology_of_ce.pdf,ce_matty.png,https://youtu.be/QbcrJKjWQGE,psychology
