error budgets to operate enterprise-level services with a thousand (or
more) engineers? Fred Moyer takes you through approaches he’s
developed working with teams in a large production ecosystem where
service reliability was a nonnegotiable business requirement.
Engineers and operations folks who are putting SLIs, SLOs, and error
budgets into practice in high-scale production environments with
diverse service architectures should come away with an understanding
of how to democratize SLOs, what objectives they should target for
enterprise-level reliability, and how to communicate and implement
error budgets across multiple teams.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/redhotpenguin/,@phredmoyer,,,,fred moyer_obser.png,https://youtu.be/c8Tjbmq66UU,"slos,error,budgets,scale",
