Engineers and operations folks who are putting SLIs, SLOs, and error
budgets into practice in high-scale production environments with
diverse service architectures should come away with an understanding
of how to democratize SLOs, what objectives they should target for
enterprise-level reliability, and how to communicate and implement
error budgets across multiple teams.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/redhotpenguin/,,,,,fred moyer_obser.png,,"slos,error,budgets,scale",
