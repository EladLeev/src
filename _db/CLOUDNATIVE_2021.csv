We also developed Puerta — a homegrown gating service that implements the Flagger webhook phases to support time-based approvals, triggering E2E jobs (CircleCI etc.), load-testing and auto release to production once canary passes on staging.

In this session, we’ll discuss why and how we built Puerta and dig into three key areas:
- How to customize your CD workflow to fit your needs and culture
- How to empower developers so they can quickly deploy their code securely 
- How we dedicated time and resources to developing this internal CD service",https://www.linkedin.com/in/0r3limelech/,@orelimelech_,https://www.linkedin.com/in/eldad-rudich/,@d3bu9,,cloud_or_eldad.png,https://youtu.be/Vs_kTJ8rOBw,"open source gating service,flagger",

Yes,,Josh Stella,CTO,Fugue,,,,Locking Down the Security of IAM,"If you use Amazon Web Services (AWS), you’re probably making extensive use of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). It’s a powerful service for managing access to your AWS services and resources that is almost like a new kind of network in the cloud. 

But for enterprise cloud environments, AWS IAM security can become quite complex. Recent high-profile cloud-based data breaches have involved AWS IAM but cannot be chalked up to simple customer mistakes. Rather, advanced cloud misconfiguration attacks exploit IAM misconfigurations that compliance controls and security professionals often miss. 

In this session, Josh will walk through some of these  IAM misconfigurations, using the AWS console to demonstrate  to  participants how to avoid becoming a victim of cloud exploits through IAM.  Josh will dig into AWS IAM and take us on a deep dive into the layers of AWS IAM and how malicious actors can exploit common misconfigurations to gain access to—and extract—data without detection. 

You’ll understand how to identify AWS IAM misconfiguration vulnerabilities you’ve missed before—and how malicious actors exploit them.

In this talk, Fugue co-founder and CEO,  Josh Stella digs into how AWS IAM works to help you think more critically about the security for your AWS use cases. You’ll understand how to identify AWS IAM misconfiguration vulnerabilities you may have missed before—and how malicious actors exploit them.

Operating a distributed high load, high throughput database in the cloud comes with several interesting challenges. In order to manage real-time serving of mission critical workloads at 100% availability we developed a Kubernetes operator that handles the operational complexities.
 
We needed to handle the following requirements: 
- Apply live patches
- Replace live cluster with tens of nodes
- Handle degraded/crashed nodes 

Under these conditions: 
- High Availability - remain 100% online with no down time
- Operate under very high workloads and traffic 
- Manage replicated records across different hardware failure groups (rack awareness)

Due to its stateful nature and the type of workloads that are usually handled, cluster management and recovery are non-trivial. We are using the Operators API to handle that complexity and control the clusters from within Kubernetes.

In this talk we’ll cover the steps we took to plan and execute and the challenges we faced and share the best practices.

There are many solutions out there.  Some are better than others.  Should state be held in a server side component?  Generally we are told this is a bad practice, but is it?  It’s unclear and this confusion may lead to poor technology stack choices that are impossible or extremely hard to change later on as your system evolves in terms of demand and performance.

We learn from the experience of others.  Choosing who to follow is hard and this topic will help you the developer or technical decision maker to meet your company’s I.T. demands in the modern world.  We will explore into a tried and true, enterprise-grade, Java Open Source stack - Open Liberty in Kubernetes - which exercises and promises to fulfill the expectations of a modern server solution that epitomizes all the elements needed to build, run and deploy an efficient production system today.

We will examine and demonstrate the fundamentals of such a system that’s built with Open Liberty in Kubernetes:
* Microservices/REST API –  Options to use when running your apps in the JVM
* Concurrency – how to take advantage of multi-core CPUs and clustered distributed systems 
* Stateful vs Stateless - while stateless apps are easier to implement, the bulk of the apps in production are stateful which involve a higher level of complexity and risk, especially when data would need to travel across multiple machine and network boundaries
* Deployment – how about containerization and orchestration using Kubernetes?

No,multi-cloud,Lawrence Finn,Author,Cloud Sidecar,,,,Enabling multi-cloud and breaking vendor lock-in with Cloud Sidecar,"Many companies want to become multi-cloud or have the ability to switch clouds. However, cloud providers try hard to lock in customers with proprietary services like storage. Cloud Sidecar provides a simple way to take existing software and deploy it to different clouds without complex rewrites.

Cloud providers offer numerous services that abstract away common problems from software developers.  No longer do companies need to manage their own file storage solutions, message queues, key-value stores, etc...  The problem is, once you start building software on top of these services you get locked into that specific cloud provider.  This is better known as vendor lock-in.  Of course, the more services you use the harder it is to go multi-cloud or switch clouds.  

Cloud Sidecar solves the problem of vendor lock-in by converting requests from one cloud's API to another cloud's API.  So if your applications use Amazon Web Services' S3 and SQS, you can easily deploy Cloud Sidecar next to your application and now it automatically uses Google Cloud's GCS and Pubsub.

Kubernetes provides a native Role based access control (RBAC) authorization scheme, allowing cluster operators to define rules to define which operations users or services can do against a particular Kubernetes object. As more enterprises migrate to cloud native environments like Kubernetes, RBAC alone presents limitations.

I will talk through the problem space, look at the kinds of security issues we need to consider, and look at where the integration points are to build in security as part of our CI/CD process.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattjarvis08/,@mattj_io,,,Conf42 Cloud Native 2021 - Matt Jarvis - Continuous Security.pdf,cloud_matt.png,https://youtu.be/VhUYRuhm5pA,"conunuous security,pipelines",
No,CI/CD,Efi Merdler-Kravitz,VP R&D,Lumigo,,,,CI/CD in the serverless era,"Serverless development introduces a new methodology of how to build real “Cloud Native” applications or workloads. It is impossible to duplicate an exact serverless environment to be run locally, and this is influencing the tools we use and the way we need to manage our CI/CD pipelines.

The main goal of Serverless is to release software faster. So, practicing CI/CD is the logical thing, but there are some adaptations that need to be taken. In this session, we will share how we are doing CI/CD on a pure serverless platform we are developing.
We will discuss:
 - Dev Environment
 - Testing Methodology
 - Deployment Pipeline, combining Bash, AWS CLI, and Serverless Framework to create a seamless CI/CD pipeline
 - Monitoring

Let's discuss good serverless practices.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/efime/,@TServerless,,,Conf42 Cloud Native 2021 - Efi Merdler-Kravitz - CICD in the serverless era.pdf,cloud_efi.png,https://youtu.be/q1_1N8KCeMM,"ci/cd,serverless",
No,CI/CD,Zan Markan,Developer Advocate,CircleCI,,,,The Need for Speed (in your CI/CD setup),"What's the longest CI/CD build you worked with? Mine once took whole day. 
This is a tale of creating and taming that monster build.

When developing software and maintaining CI/CD and testing pipelines we are often compelled to increase our test coverage by adding more tests, and therefore improve our apps’ quality. After all, more automation equals better software, right?

There’s a flipside to this equation however, and a point at which we start seeing diminishing returns from each test we add. Taken to extreme, these diminishing returns begin to actively harm our ability to deliver working software. 

In this talk we will look at a tale of creating and taming a monster of an all day build (one that really happened to me once), and cover tips, tricks, and tools to help you avoid that scenario in the future - from obvious suggestions such a s adding resources to your build machines, to less obvious ones like removing tests altogether.

No,lessons learned,Lian Li,Engineering Manager,Container Solutions,,,,Kubernetes won't save you,"Kubernetes has become the new darling of the infrastructure world. Not only is it a great piece of technology for managing your containers, but in conjunction with the possibility to rent managed clusters from any of the big Cloud providers, Kubernetes offers organisations the possibility to get rid of the shackles of hosting and/or managing one’s infrastructure.

But that does not mean that Kubernetes is a one-size-fits-all solution. Especially in big corporations, bigger, systemic and/or more pressing problems could be revealed while implementing a big shift like moving to the cloud. As consultants, we can often observe the chaos and frustration that breaks out, when the vision of management does not align with the reality of what the teams are able to deliver. More often than not, it’s not a technological problem, but a cultural one.

When is an organisation ripe for cloud transformation? How can we make sure we are addressing the problems at their root?

No,lessons learned,Dhiraj Hegde,Architect,Salesforce,,,,Containing an Elephant: How we took HBase and HDFS from private data centers into Kubernetes and Public Cloud,"Operating a distributed system like HBase/Hadoop FS at peta byte scale took years to master in our private data centers. This talk describes our dramatic shift towards running a mission critical stateful application on Kubernetes in Public Cloud, why we did it and the challenges we had to overcome.

Salesforce runs a very large footprint of HBase and HDFS clusters in our data centers with multiple petabytes of data, billions of queries per day over thousands of machines. After more than a decade of running our own data centers, we pivoted towards public cloud for its scalability and availability. As part of this foray, we made a bold decision to move our HBase clusters from staid bare metal hosts to the dynamic and immutable world of containers and Kubernetes. This move brought with it a number of challenges which are likely to find echoes in other such mature stateful applications adapting to public cloud and Kubernetes. The challenges include
1. Limitations in Kubernetes while deploying large scale stateful applications
2. Failures in HBase/HDFS as the DNS records keep changing in Kubernetes
3. Resilience of HBase/HDFS even when a whole availability zone fails in Public Cloud
4. Introducing encryption in communication over untrusted public cloud networks without application being aware

 This talk will go over how we overcame these challenges and the benefits we are beginning to see from these efforts.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhirajlink/,@dhirajtxt,,,Conf42 Cloud Native 2021 - Dhiraj Hegde - Containing An Elephant.pdf,cloud_dhiraj.png,https://youtu.be/T3_UMV6_tKw,"hbase,hdfs,kubernetes,public cloud",

No,lessons learned,Stephane Jourdan,CTO,CloudSkiff,,,,Why you should take care of infrastructure drift,"As infrastructure as code (IaC) becomes widely adopted by users with heterogenous skillsets, and as IaC codebases become larger and larger, it becomes harder to track drift. Drift is a deviation between the actual infrastructure state and the IaC codebase. It causes issues for security posture management, collaborative work, and maintenance. It’s hard to improve what you can’t measure! Can we define good metrics for drift? 

Developers track unit tests coverage to track how well unit tests match application code over time. Can we use an analogy and define infrastructure code coverage to track how well IaC matches the actual infrastructure state? 

In this talk, we will show how minor infrastructure drift can cause issues. We will then introduce various ways to track IaC coverage, and how we can use them to bring visibility into the state of infrastructure and anticipate common drift issues. We will also show how measuring IaC codebase also benefits IaC adoption.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanejourdan/,@sjourdan,,,Conf42 Cloud Native 2021 - Stephane Jourdan - Infrastructure drift.pdf,cloud_stephane.png,https://youtu.be/--DgCAQwFVY,infrastructure drift,
