Yes,,Radu Marginean,Software Developer,,,,,Uranium - a visual quantum computing platform,"Many of the quantum circuits used in the NISQ era, and beyond, can be understood visually as a collection of gates in circuits placed according to some pattern. Hence, the use case for designing circuits visually using an editor is a strong one. However, most of the existing circuit editors are rather basic. Uranium is an open-source platform that intends to fill this unoccupied space: https://uranium.transilvania-quantum.org/. At its core, it comprises an advanced circuit editor which is easy to use and versatile, and a high-performance simulator written in Rust that can run in your browser or offline. It features a large collection of one and two-qubit gates, many of which are not available elsewhere, plus several larger gates.  Circuits can be composed and reused, this way large, complex circuits can be easily created. The editor is easy to use, productive, and supports export to external formats. Circuits with up to 27 qubits can be simulated in your browser. We also provide support for offline simulation for up to 32 qubits.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/radu-marginean-76ababa4/?fbclid=IwAR2k_ELpfmks8JHLBmbWtwT7TSnCDXcq3jXMDC7RpIwPqkdJmljt6U64EDM,,,,,qc_radu_marginean.png,https://youtu.be/MJFy3gucdIs,uranium visual platform,15
Yes,,Sam Samuel,CTO,"Mobility Business Group, Cisco",,,,Quantum communication challenges in scaling quantum computers,"To scale quantum computers, the communication between them is key. The benefits of quantum computation are realized when that computation occurs in a distributed manner - this requires a quantum network to join those computational elements together, placing the prospect of quantum communication as a critical piece of the puzzle. However long-distance quantum communication is raising a number of questions that are not yet answered. 

There are different modes of operations that a quantum network could have, each of them requiring quantum repeaters to guarantee end-to-end communication. All these modes come with their challenges in terms of communication rate, quantum memory management or cost of the network. This leads to additional challenges to address such as the reliability of information exchange and the integrity of end-to-end transport, as well as considerations around the engineering approach to quantum networking.

In this session, we will explore the role of quantum communication in getting quantum computers to scale meaningfully, the related challenges the industry needs to overcome and how Cisco is approaching these issues through close collaboration with selected academic partners.

Yes,,Robert Slade,Malware Researcher,,,,,Quantum Computing: Implications for Security,"Quantum computing has been seen, in trade, research, and even science fiction literature, as a way to crack encryption keys with ease.  

With the advent of the first practical (and now commercial!) quantum computing devices, it is possible to see that such a ""universal decryption"" application is likely a long ways off.

On the other hand, there are some very interesting applications that are much closer, with implications, both positive and negative, for information security.

This presentation will provide a brief outline of the realities and limitations of quantum computing, and then look at a wide variety of applications and implications in all domains of security.
