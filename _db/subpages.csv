Chaos Engineering has evolved in the past few years with the development of the Cloud-Native paradigm.  Chaos testing is seen as a must for all Cloud-Native practitioners emphasizing reliability as a container challenge.  With the introduction of the LitmusChaos tool which helps curate Cloud-Native Chaos Engineering in a controlled way, practicing Chaos has become easier. Belonging to the CNCF ecosystem, Litmus stresses upon applying Chaos Engineering to modern architectures and building resilient applications simultaneously. The features and ideas majorly surround Community Collaboration, Observability, GitOps, Open APIs & much more. This talk stresses on the evolution of Chaos Engineering with the introduction of the LitmusChaos 2.0

##Target Audience

This workshop is intended for SREs, DevOps practitioners, Developers, Software Engineers, Students, and anyone else who is interested in learning the art and value of chaos engineering and resilience. This workshop also includes a certification option. You have a chance to become a __LitmusChaos Certified Chaos Practitioner__.

cloudsmith,"Universal Artifact Management, Made Simple with Cloudsmith",https://youtu.be/mzVE3KAXu-E,"###Cloud-native, Secure, Universal Artifact Management Made Simple by Cloudsmith

Cloudsmith is the only truly cloud-native platform for engineers looking to set up a secure, cloud-native artifact repository in 60 seconds. Cloudsmith offers 24/7 engineer support, 225 points of presence, support for 28+ formats, and is ISO 270001 certified.

We make universal artifact management simple, easy and secure. Ownership of how your software artifacts, containers, and packages are pulled in, stored, and distributed is vital. It's the central point everything should pass through, and going forwards, as supply chain attacks increase, every single opening in your supply chain is a vector for attack.

You need a single source of truth, for all software and dependencies, that isolates and protects your teams and customers from supply chain attacks.

**Verifying assets with Continuous Packaging**

From signature verification to Docker vulnerability scanning, Cloudsmith helps you continuously assess threats and prevent tampering or corruption of your software. Easily protect your customers by shipping clean software only. Using Continuous Packaging (CP), Cloudsmith offers the observability and control to ensure that your software is always verified, packaged, and ready to deliver.

**The Package Delivery Network for Distributors**

Cloudsmith's Package Delivery Network (PDN) was built specifically for software distribution at the edge. Use entitlement tokens to seamlessly sell and distribute your software while utilizing custom domains to increase trust and present your brand as the DNS endpoint for global delivery. Whether deploying, or shipping licensed software to your customers, our global Package Delivery Network (PDN) is optimized to ensure lightning-fast delivery.

**Repositories Built The Way You Want**

Cloudsmith's multi-format repositories allow you to create a repository structure that works for your unique teams and processes. No more repository-per-format used. Instead, you can have as many formats within a repo as you like - letting you create a repo per environment (dev, stage, production), project, or per format.

jeli,Not Incidents. ‍Opportunities.,,"### Not Incidents. Opportunities.

![](./assets/custom/jeli subpage item 1.PNG)

Every incident is an opportunity that reveals how your organization really works.

Jeli allows you to see that opportunity.

![](./assets/custom/jeli subpage item 2.PNG)

### Streamline your investigation

Incidents rarely happen or play out as expected. Jeli takes you through a customized, step-by-step process for each incident that results in a thorough, annotated timeline with the right data, comments and questions to learn from incidents, not just fix them.

Jeli starts by collecting the necessary information from your current technical tools using our Incident Response Bot. Our bot won't disrupt your work with unhelpful messages. Instead, it helps pinpoint often overlooked human factors.

### Automatically create a timeline that makes sense

Jeli's timelines give you a clear overview of who, what, where and when from the start of an incident to its resolution.

![](./assets/custom/jeli subpage item 3.PNG)

### Add details & color

Anyone on the team can categorize, tag and comment in the timeline, to build out the story and identify the right questions for follow-ups, interviews and reports.

### Reveal deep insights across incidents

Jeli is designed to make cross-incident analysis inviting and easy. Exploring multiple incidents over time lets teams find organizational contributing factors (code freeze!), identify islands of knowledge among staff, and provide evidence to re-align staffing and spending. Jeli is designed from the ground up to replace the grind of post-mortems with the joy of learning.

![](./assets/custom/jeli subpage item 4.PNG)


### Creating opportunities at industry leaders

Jeli is used by leading companies including Honeycomb, Zendesk, Indeed, Xero, Unity and Codesee.


### Yes, we're hiring!

We're actively seeking a Head of Marketing, Customer Success Manager, and always on the lookout for good engineers. [Get in touch](https://www.jeli.io/careers)!
