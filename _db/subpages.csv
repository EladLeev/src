bastionzero,Zero finally means zero,,"#### At **BastionZero, we are reimagining the tools used to manage remote access to servers, containers and clusters. Our tools make it easy to access, control, monitor and log shell access to targets in any datacenter or public cloud. Weâ€™ve developed a next-generation cryptographic security model that eliminates the single point of compromise that plagues existing remote access tools in the market. On top of that, we are building collaborative and interactive interfaces that will revolutionize the way engineers manage access to servers and containers.
