microsoft,Microsoft Azure at Conf42 Chaos Engineering,,"Microsoft wants to help the Chaos Engineering community grow.

They are missing the opportunity to meet with Chaos Engineers in person this year, and they are putting all our energy into connecting virtually.

Meanwhile, Microsoft invites you to check the technical resources below:

* _[Microsoft Azure](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftAzureAtConf42Python2022) at Conf42 Chaos Engineering 2022_ - Improve application resilience with chaos testing by deliberately introducing faults that simulate real-world outages. Azure Chaos Studio Preview is a fully managed chaos engineering experimentation platform for accelerating discovery of hard-to-find problems, from late-stage development through production. Disrupt your apps intentionally to identify gaps and plan mitigations before your customers are impacted by a problem.

* _[Azure Heroes](https://aka.ms/AzureHeroesAtConf42ChaosEngineering) at Conf42 Chaos Engineering 2022_ – Blockchain-based digital badges (NFTs). A fun way to earn digital collectibles for inclusive behaviour and meaningful impact in the technical community. Your unique badger is very special and cryptographically secured by the blockchain (independent of the Azure Heroes programme) so it requires a blockchain wallet to safely store it.
