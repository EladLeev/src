In this talk, we present Code Insight, our tool for scanning our code for vulnerabilities:

* First, we introduce how we work and deliver code at Form3 to set the scene of our DevSecOps practices.
* Then, we move on to discuss what the requirements of Code Insight to fit our practices at Form3 are.
* Next up, we present the Code Insight architecture that we have built using Github webhooks and AWS technologies.
* Finally, we round off the presentation with our lessons learned and next steps.

Infrastructure as Code is one of the pillars of ""best practices"" in DevOps world now. It is more and more popular to use it through CI/CD pipelines, but... what about security? 
Do we really care about it?

In this talk we will explore a few Terraform scanners and we will try to answer to one question: are these tools good enough to be security scanners?",https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawelpiwosz/,@pawelpiwosz,,,,dso_pawel.png,,"security testing,terraform templates",
No,testing,Tal Melamed,Senior Director,Contrast Security,,,,Automatic serverless security testing: Delivering secure apps continuously,"Serverless technology eliminates the need for development teams to provision servers, and it also results in some security threats being passed to the cloud provider. This frees up developers to concentrate on building logic and producing value quickly. But cloud functions still execute code. If the software is written poorly, it can lead to a security disaster.

How can developers ensure that their code is secure enough? They can scan for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in open-source code. They can even scan their Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool to identify insecure configurations. But what about custom code? At many organizations, the application security team struggles to keep up with the speed of development in a serverless environment. Traditional testing tools not only provide very limited coverage, but also slow development cycles unacceptably. Serverless code contains a mixture of cloud configurations and application programming interfaces (API) calls. As a result, legacy solutions lack the context that is necessary in a serverless environment, and the consequence is a lack of observability and slower response times.

Fortunately, it does not have to be this way. Organizations can leverage robust security during serverless development, automatically—if it is done properly. In this talk, we will discuss common risks in serverless environments. We will then cover existing testing methodologies and why they do not work well for serverless. Finally, we will present a new, completely frictionless way of testing serverless applications automatically—with no scripts, no tests, and no delays.

However, similar approaches have been used since the early 2000s to indicate security verifications on open source components. SCA has become an evolution of that. It is the process of identifying and listing all the components and versions present in the code, checking each specific service, and looking for outdated or vulnerable libraries that may impose security risks to the application. 

These tools can also check for legal issues regarding the use of open-source software with different licensing terms and conditions. Nevertheless, how do those SCA tools work, and how can they help identify and remediate open source libraries used in a codebase? This talk focuses on and explains to the audience how these tools work and the main information that these tools rely on, such as the application manifest, vulnerability data sources, and dependency metadata.

TACO stands for Traceability, Access, Compliance, and Operations and is a set of 20 controls I use as a guideline for helping organizations define automated governance for their software delivery pipelines. However, the primary purpose of TACO is to provide a common language for the organization to understand what """"good"""" pipelines mean for them and how to get there.

This model allows for the creation of opinionated pipelines and helps create a common understanding across teams as to what is required in order to be secure. Taking a TACO approach can be considered a part of implementing a DevSecOps program and I’ve used this approach at multiple banks. Having this baseline helps build organizational confidence in the automation of software delivery.

No,lessons learned,Adarsh Shah,CEO,CompuZest,,,,From Infrastructure as Code to Environment as Code: Challenges scaling IaC and how to resolve them,"Infrastructure as Code(IaC) has made managing infrastructure easier in a lot of ways, but there are many challenges that companies accept as the cost of adopting IaC especially when scaling. IaC is good at provisioning individual resources (or a few of them together) but engineering teams want an entire environment with various components like networking, platform (ec2/eks), database, s3 buckets, etc. to deploy and operate their applications.

To provision and tear down an entire environment, these teams have two options. They can either hand roll pipelines to manage individual resources and then manage complex dependencies between these resources within those pipelines or create a monolith IaC for the entire environment. These approaches are inefficient and slow down feature development and innovation. They also make replicating, visualizing & understanding environments difficult. What if there were a better way?

This talk digs into these challenges to try to better understand them and then look at how to resolve them. We will introduce Environment as Code (abstraction over IaC) that enables teams to provision & teardown entire Environments in an efficient way and promotes best practices like loosely coupled infrastructure resources.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Challenges scaling Infrastructure as Code
* What is Environment as Code?
* How Environment as Code can help resolve those challenges?",https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarsh-shah/,@shahadarsh,,,,dso_adarsh.png,,From IaC to Environment as Code,

While this has the benefits of its inherent safety measures, this can also be restrictive, all while creating new challenges for security. Immutable concepts are much more effective when it comes to securing cloud native environments and infrastructure, which is becoming an increasingly more complex task.

This talk will focus on some of the fundamentals of immutable architecture, best practices and recommended design patterns to work around its limitations and enhance security, as well as what you most certainly should not be doing when running immutable architecture both from an infrastructure and security perspective.

The recent Twitch breach may have begun with a lone server misconfiguration, but it's blast radius reached everything from sensitive customer data to source code for yet-to-be-released applications. Today’s cloud attacks don’t exploit a single misconfiguration, but rather a series of them.

* Evaluate your Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources for weaknesses that attackers can exploit
* Employ penetration testing methodologies to assess the blast radius of public-facing resource misconfigurations
* Harden your cloud security posture using policy as code to address complex, multi-resource “blast radius” risks
