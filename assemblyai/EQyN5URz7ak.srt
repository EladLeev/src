00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,534
Hi, my name is Philippe and I'm here to share our vision and

2
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:26,962
how businesses can start in cryptocurrency with confidence.

3
00:00:27,106 --> 00:00:31,122
Today at UTrust, well soon to be named XMoney,

4
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:34,774
our mission is to democratize access to new digital money,

5
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:38,554
making it easy for any business to access and

6
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:41,994
accept. We want to make digital assets accessible and

7
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:45,910
universal, so that any user can pay in any merchant

8
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,050
with less intermediaries and more freedom.

9
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,998
But before talking about our solution and how we help companies

10
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:57,486
capture this market, it's important to understand some of the technology

11
00:00:57,588 --> 00:01:01,006
foundations of digital assets, blockchain in particular,

12
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:05,810
not the technical elements per se, but the new concept it enables.

13
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,634
Blockchain technology has brought about the paradigm shift by

14
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:13,186
allowing direct transfer of value in the public network. Not a

15
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,558
message, a request or an extension, or an

16
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:20,706
external representation, but true direct transfer of value between two parties

17
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:24,806
without intermediaries. This is taken to the transfer of physical cash,

18
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:28,666
but in a digital verse. If you consider transfer of value in a

19
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,930
digital space without blockchain technology, for example,

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,286
your typical home banking, these are mere representations

21
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:38,886
of value. With blockchain, it is possible for users

22
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:42,230
to have direct custody of their own assets in a

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,626
similar way to physical assets like cash or gold,

24
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:50,298
as long as of course, they have access to private keys. Hence the popular expression

25
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,830
not your keys, not your crypto.

26
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,182
While digital assets are based upon blockchain technology layer,

27
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,718
there are different types of assets with varying

28
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:04,858
degrees of openness, different use cases, value and properties

29
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:09,074
that can be less or more decentralized. Think of bitcoin

30
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:13,154
versus ethereum with a volatile or fixed value USDC

31
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:16,566
USDT as examples of stablecoins that

32
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:19,850
can be issued by anyone from a single individual, a group,

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,490
to institutions or governments.

34
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,686
Digital asset is thus a broad category,

35
00:02:25,798 --> 00:02:28,314
despite similar underlying technology.

36
00:02:28,512 --> 00:02:32,186
Not all digital assets are the same, even in

37
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,774
specific cases. In payments, for example, there are

38
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:39,182
differences. Just think of for example the difference between paying

39
00:02:39,236 --> 00:02:42,410
with an american dollar or venezuelan peso,

40
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,446
for example. The different accepting and issuer risks affect

41
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:50,114
the market price of one versus the other in FX markets and

42
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:53,806
others, and these same applies in the case of stablecoins.

43
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:58,162
For the use case of payments, cryptocurrency or digital

44
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:01,842
assets have been through narrative evolution,

45
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:05,862
which has been showcased in the terminology and target uses or use

46
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:09,606
cases. This evolution translated into a higher degree of maturity and

47
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:12,682
adoption to specialized use cases. For example,

48
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:16,902
today there are stable coins with a one to one pegged to the US dollar.

49
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:20,474
Well, not all the times, but that's a topic

50
00:03:20,522 --> 00:03:24,318
for another discussion and presentation. Maybe in the future.

51
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:28,480
And this evolution in the narrative in the

52
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,934
usability use cases of cryptocurrency is also cumulative.

53
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:37,090
Bitcoin has evolved from pure payment narrative, to a speculative investment,

54
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,730
to an inflation edge asset, to a store of value.

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,034
In the future, we will no longer have CDBCs, central bank digital

56
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:49,874
currencies or national currencies issued by central

57
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:53,560
banks which hybrid elements from different

58
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,858
aspects of these technology. They might have more

59
00:03:57,964 --> 00:04:01,514
or centralized or decentralized elements. There will

60
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:05,322
certainly be a hybrid of different elements using

61
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:07,770
blockchain technology as a foundation.

62
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,074
And of course customers of the future will be digital

63
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:16,062
natives. It's not already this is a young

64
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:20,058
segment of a very young, connected and demanding users,

65
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:23,646
hyperconnected, holding cryptocurrency and part of a connected

66
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:27,710
metaverse. This is a prime audience for any business to capture

67
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,662
and retain, especially when it comes to payments.

68
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:35,534
For businesses crypto adoption, this is a really relevant

69
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:39,014
topic. Adding cryptocurrency as a means of payment will no longer be

70
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:42,934
optional, but the status quo. Almost 32% of

71
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:46,502
SMEs in the US accept cryptocurrency and this number

72
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:50,446
is trending. The decision in adding payments in crypto has translated

73
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,818
into increase of transactional volume of more than 100%

74
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:57,258
with a return on investment of more than 300%

75
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:00,766
in some. This is an audience that any business should

76
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:04,494
be paying attention, close attention to because these are

77
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:08,398
different, the way they interact and how they consume information,

78
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:12,646
how they're influenced and how they pay. Most brands

79
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:16,846
have either started or are already catering to this trend,

80
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:20,546
introducing crypto gamification metaverse elements to

81
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:24,478
position themselves as appealing and leaders in their respective markets.

82
00:05:24,654 --> 00:05:27,654
And this is exactly where we come in.

83
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,470
UTrust is the gateway to this market.

84
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,042
For years our solution has been allowing merchants across all verticals

85
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:38,486
to accepting crypto payments, making it accessible to

86
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:42,358
tap into this new rising market. It is a payment gateway,

87
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:46,010
allowing any business to accept crypto as means of payment,

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,754
be it at a checkout or through invoicing. Simple and

89
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:53,946
without any risk of volatility. A trusted intermediary

90
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,960
that settles in fiat in the merchant's bank account.

91
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,298
We provide low transactional fees at 1%

92
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:05,582
end to end, no chargeback risks,

93
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:09,774
a drastic reduction of fraud and fast transactional settlement

94
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:13,662
versus legacy solutions. We make the checkout integration

95
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,734
super simple. These plug and play experience with

96
00:06:17,772 --> 00:06:21,366
support for the most widely used market plugins, as well

97
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:24,454
as an API for custom integrations with no

98
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:28,386
blockchain technical expertise required for the merchant.

99
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:32,390
We also make the payment experience seamless to the consumer

100
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,074
and support any wallet in the market. It's an blockchain experience

101
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:39,738
open to all, with no ecosystem lock in.

102
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:43,402
We solve all the hurdles of crypto payments for merchants

103
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:46,750
without any risk of volatility. The merchant always

104
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,554
receives a steady value as a regulated and compliant

105
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:54,354
institution, employing state of the art blockchain screening technology for

106
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:58,322
AML. That's antimoney laundering to protect users and

107
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,230
merchants in the ecosystem from malicious actors,

108
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:05,338
making the whole experience reliable and secure

109
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:09,506
with no hidden costs or fees, no annual subscription

110
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:13,142
nor commitment. Merchants only pay 1% of any

111
00:07:13,196 --> 00:07:16,690
transacted volume, providing flexibility and choice.

112
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,634
Our solution is extremely competitive given the base layer we

113
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,374
operate upon blockchain. By reducing these amount of intermediaries

114
00:07:24,422 --> 00:07:28,006
in a transaction, we obtain a lower degree of complexity.

115
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:31,434
Less intermediaries translate into more simplicity and

116
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:35,086
lower costs. With less costs, more of the value can

117
00:07:35,108 --> 00:07:38,906
be captured and passed to the client. This is a market of users

118
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:42,538
that already uses crypto for payments, but obfuscated

119
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:46,162
under more intermediary layers. Many users already pay

120
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,918
with crypto using their linked cards, paying extra fees

121
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:53,698
for the conversion. At the same time, the merchant pays a

122
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:57,890
higher percentage to receive the transaction because of the underlying rails.

123
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,358
These also allows for new business models. For example,

124
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,290
how is it possible to transform a fee into an additional revenue?

125
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,914
Like instead of a merchant paying a processing fee, this can

126
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:12,300
be truly offset to zero,

127
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,994
perhaps even becoming a net positive. Well,

128
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,822
is this entirely new? At its core,

129
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:22,082
no. This model already exists,

130
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:25,886
and it's currently used by legacy payment processors such

131
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:29,710
as PayPal. And it's not optional. All you have to do is

132
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,230
read their terms of service. How do they do it then?

133
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,246
Well, during the transit time of the funds, from the moment the client pays

134
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,090
until the merchant actually receives the money in their bank, these funds in

135
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,526
transit can be used and reinvested to generate

136
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:48,294
additional revenue. The difference? With us, they retain all

137
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:51,782
the funds to themselves. We won't retain that extra

138
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:55,894
money and pass it to the merchant, offsetting their costs a more fair and

139
00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:59,226
transparent way to take on a core model. And of

140
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,774
course, this is entirely optional. But it's

141
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:06,454
something that the current model and the foundation of blockchain

142
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:09,866
technology allow us to pass on and to

143
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:13,546
provide that extra mile to merchants. And this universe

144
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:17,402
of merchants keeps growing, especially in the sectors of ecommerce,

145
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:21,006
real estate, fashion, luxury items and

146
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:24,866
digital goods. Many of our clients want to establish themselves

147
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:29,010
as pioneers in their sector, and we are prepared to help them

148
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,866
take the maximum advantage of this new segment, be it

149
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:36,454
in co marketing initiatives, ecosystem reach out or through

150
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,066
our network of partners. Because payments

151
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:43,522
in crypto have unique challenges when compared with traditional

152
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:47,410
gateways. Our approach helps to maximize impact

153
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,014
in reach. At UTrUst, we see our merchants as partners

154
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:54,406
in these whole ecosystem journey, so don't

155
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:58,074
get left behind. As a merchant, this is these time to adopt and

156
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:01,366
join the ecosystem. Although the perception may be it's

157
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:05,278
early, this is the perfect moment for you to position yourself

158
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:08,554
as a market leader. In a similar way to the adoption of the Internet,

159
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:11,806
this is a critical moment for the mass adoption of

160
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:15,422
digital assets. Looking at the past, we see that companies that

161
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,874
persevere are the ones that keep adapting, the ones that align

162
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:22,266
with the trends of the future before they become tomorrow's

163
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:25,814
status quo. So we

164
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:29,494
invite you, web invite your business to start accepting the money

165
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:33,480
of the future by visiting our website and onboard today.

166
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,420
Thank you all.
