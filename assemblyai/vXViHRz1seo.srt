1
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,122
Everyone, very warm welcome to the Conf 42 session

2
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:28,098
on empowering executives to embrace quantum computing.

3
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:31,606
This session is ideal for executives with little to maybe no

4
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:34,742
technical background and who are extremely interested

5
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:38,166
in learning more about quantum computing. My aimed in this

6
00:00:38,188 --> 00:00:41,866
session would be to provide you with an overview of what quantum bidding is,

7
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:45,226
why is it maybe necessary for you to understand at this point

8
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:48,474
of time and if it is essential for you to

9
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:52,670
adopt this upcoming technology in your existing industry.

10
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,230
My name is Vardaan Sahgal and IBM, the software head at

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,210
Womanium where I also lead the Quantum Solutions launchpad

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,074
headquartered in Washington, D. C. Alternatively, I am also

13
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,914
an IBM Qiskit advocate and have a breadth of research experience in

14
00:01:08,952 --> 00:01:11,982
theoretical software domains of quantum computing.

15
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:15,694
Talking about womanium Womanium is basically a nonprofit

16
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,060
organization based out of Washington, DC, US.

17
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,834
Womanium was started seven years back with the aim of educating

18
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:26,818
young girls and promoting more women in STEM and essentially creating

19
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:30,506
the scientific leaders of tomorrow. Till date, womanium has

20
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:33,978
helped students get trained in STEM fields by providing over

21
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:37,766
1100 scholarships spelled across a staggering

22
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:41,326
88 countries. Womanium has been actively involved in

23
00:01:41,348 --> 00:01:45,290
training the next generation of workforce by education participants

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:49,210
in STEM fields from life sciences to engineering

25
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,634
to quantum computing, and has been the recipient

26
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:56,114
of various international awards along the way. For the past

27
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:59,586
couple of years, womanium, in very close collaboration with

28
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:03,294
a lot of us national laboratories, has been working on providing

29
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:07,138
training in all sorts of quantum domains, quantum computing,

30
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:10,390
quantum hardware, quantum sensing and even

31
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,926
quantum communication for that matter. As I mentioned before,

32
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:17,766
the main purpose of this presentation is towards a

33
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:21,046
nontechnical audience. My main aim in this session

34
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:24,202
would be to provide a bit overview of what quantum computing is

35
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:27,834
and why does it matter for executives level people like

36
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:31,680
you to understand this upcoming technology?

37
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,394
While I discuss quantum computing, I would delve

38
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:40,362
into some real world applications and real world use case studies

39
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:44,430
where quantum computing has already played a major role in defining industries

40
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,274
in the recent years. I would also highlight some very good

41
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:51,586
practices and some operations which you

42
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:55,406
should take while stepping into this overhyped quantum computing

43
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:58,806
industry. So stay tuned till the end of this presentation and

44
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:02,294
I hope you like it. So the first question is, why should

45
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:06,246
you be interested in quantum? After all, is it just

46
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:10,070
hype? But the very important

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,274
point is that even if you put aside the hype, I feel

48
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:16,698
that the stats shown on the screen right now should be more than enough to

49
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:20,670
get you interested. As of this year, more than $36

50
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,206
billion of public funding has been allocated towards the

51
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:27,710
research and innovation of quantum technologies across the globe.

52
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,522
You mind that this is a billion with the capital and Bolt B

53
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:37,246
and add to the private players working in the quantum

54
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:41,154
market, this figure grows even higher and

55
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:44,418
this humongous investments is bound to

56
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,846
make a very significant effect change

57
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:50,790
in a lot of industries. In fact,

58
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,738
according to a recent survey, 97% of the industry executives

59
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:58,806
already believe that quantum computing is bound

60
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:01,900
to disrupt the industries in the very near future.

61
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,910
A few decades back, quantum was just heretical.

62
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,946
It was just in textbooks and research laboratories. But now

63
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:14,094
it is very real and very much alive with more than

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,870
100 active quantum players in the entire ecosystem.

65
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,774
As expected, the tech giants of the industry were the very first

66
00:04:21,812 --> 00:04:25,874
adapters of this emerging technology. But apart from that,

67
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:29,406
now we are actually seeing a lot of new startups with heavy

68
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:33,090
capital backings move into this domain. And not only

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,158
startups, we are also seeing a lot of pure quantum companies

70
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:41,362
going public, making it more and more significant

71
00:04:41,426 --> 00:04:45,506
to actually work in the quantum industry. And gradually,

72
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,998
with the trend of huge investments, the traditional

73
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:53,180
non quantum companies are also slowly adopting this new technology.

74
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,430
Judging by the trend, the investments in quantum

75
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,746
are not stopping anytime soon. And with

76
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:04,206
the fast paced research that is going on, we can definitely see that

77
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:08,250
the early advantages quantum computing can be observed

78
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,920
in as nearly as maybe next four to five years.

79
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,806
Now that I have got all three at least interested in

80
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:19,794
hype about what quantum computing is, the next question should

81
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:23,090
be essentially, what is quantum computing?

82
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,158
And technically, I would love to dive into the fundamentals of

83
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:30,978
quantum computing and start explaining all about superposition,

84
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:34,630
all about entanglement, maybe what is Schorz's algorithm?

85
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,882
But honestly, I feel that you don't

86
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:42,970
need that pipeline, especially the executives present here

87
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,082
listening to me in this session. Because this

88
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:50,646
technical stuff, it comes at a later stage.

89
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:54,334
It is defined for a different audience. For you all

90
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:57,886
this does not matter or should not matter, because, okay,

91
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:01,914
let me ask you a question. You all use Internet,

92
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,314
right? Obviously you are streaming this

93
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:09,266
session right now online. So that answers my

94
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:12,610
question. But honestly, try to answer this. How many of you

95
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,354
actually know how the Internet works? Or maybe

96
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:19,862
for that matter, how does your mobile phone work?

97
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:23,414
Or maybe your laptop work? You don't know. And that

98
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:27,410
is okay, because we have been using classic computers for a long time

99
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,746
on a daily basis without worrying about the

100
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,266
underlying electronics. And the same should go

101
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:37,946
for quantum computing as well. Unless you're working at the

102
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:41,318
very bottommost level of research in quantum computing,

103
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:43,646
you should not be worried about what it is.

104
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:47,694
Instead, I would suggest that the interest should

105
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:50,862
be in the question of the high level stuff.

106
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:54,658
Maybe why is quantum computing necessary for my business,

107
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:58,366
or what are the advantages which I could get from quantum

108
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:02,354
computing? What are the tangible benefits which my

109
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:07,010
business or my organization could avail from quantum computing?

110
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,334
And continuing along these lines, I would like

111
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:14,726
to introduce quantum computing in a much more, I would

112
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,658
say, easier manner for you guys. And this

113
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:22,518
is, I feel, the best way to understand the tangible benefits of what quantum

114
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:26,102
computing is. Try imagining the problem of solving

115
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,780
a simple maze, a maze problem.

116
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:33,614
Now, if you try solving this particular maze problem using a classical computer,

117
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:37,246
it will intuitively just try solving each and

118
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:40,558
every part. It will try going from one part into the next and to

119
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:43,678
the next, and it goes on until it finds the

120
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:47,460
correct path. That is how the classical computer works.

121
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,994
On the other hand, if you look at the picture on the right hand side

122
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:55,054
of the screen, the quantum computers solves the maze problem

123
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:58,466
in a very different way. It is faster,

124
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,146
but in a different sense. It would be incorrect

125
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:06,146
if we say that quantum computers solve this maze

126
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:09,954
problem by checking all the parts faster

127
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:13,306
than a classic computer. No, it does not work that way. Even if

128
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:17,350
we say that quantum computers are just checking all the parts

129
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,666
in a more efficient way. Again, incorrect, because the

130
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:24,622
quantum computer is inherently built different. It is

131
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:28,266
not at all checking all the parts. It is, in a way, just changing

132
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:31,370
the rules of the game itself. Quantum computers,

133
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,518
using some, I would say, let's say, magical quantum properties,

134
00:08:35,694 --> 00:08:39,630
can directly understand the maze and instantly

135
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,546
compute the correct solution. And again,

136
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:46,450
these so called magical properties might

137
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,886
seem a bit tacky to you right now,

138
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:52,294
and you might be wondering what these

139
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:56,502
are. How is this happening? But these are not important for you right now.

140
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,822
You could easily skip this for the time being, because these magical properties,

141
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:05,050
which might be very, very important for physicists and

142
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,170
maybe computer scientists, maybe researchers,

143
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,962
they might find this really interesting and very

144
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:15,486
important to know. But for you, at this executive level, this does not make

145
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:19,162
a difference. And now comes a very critical point in this presentation,

146
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:23,294
because I just mentioned to you that quantum computing can outperform classical

147
00:09:23,342 --> 00:09:27,506
computers. So you are already thinking about

148
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:31,006
all the various possibilities of what quantum

149
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:35,250
users can do. Maybe quantum computers can

150
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,706
help make your daily tasks faster. So why

151
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:42,054
not just invite schrodingers cat to just do

152
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:45,782
your daily talks for you? Or maybe you

153
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:50,694
are thinking of finally colonializing

154
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:55,014
Mars, taking humans to Mars, setting up colonies over there using quantum

155
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:58,426
computers. Why not? It is faster than a

156
00:09:58,448 --> 00:10:01,360
classical computer, so it will solve all our problems.

157
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,342
And maybe you are even thinking of making time

158
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,270
travel possible using quantum computers.

159
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,400
This is all nonsense stuff. But coming to the real stuff,

160
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,430
can robots actually rule over humans

161
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,220
using quantum computers again,

162
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,438
right? So this is all just hype.

163
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:27,126
All these possibilities are, I would

164
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:31,094
say, fantasizing about quantum computers. This is not what

165
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,830
is possible, even by a long stretch.

166
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,442
And job's side, I would sincerely ask or request everyone

167
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:42,780
to take a breather, take a few steps back. And yes,

168
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,198
quantum computing does hold a tremendous advantage.

169
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:49,926
Absolutely. But is it going to replace our loving old

170
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:53,754
classical computers? Quantum and classical computers

171
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:57,646
are bound to coexist, and they have very specific

172
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:00,750
domains where both of them will exist.

173
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,946
Quantum computers might have an impact in specific

174
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:09,246
industries, huge impact. But they are not like superpowers,

175
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:12,546
right? Sent from above, sent from the God itself

176
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,950
to help us just reimagine things on earth.

177
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,666
That is not. Quantum computers are, they are not magic.

178
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:23,286
They are still very much science. They are still very much bound by

179
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,094
the laws of the nature. So looking at the realistic and practical side

180
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:31,094
of things, I would say optimization and chemical

181
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:34,486
simulation problems are one of the clear winners in getting a quantum

182
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:38,214
advantage, especially in the near future. And this is closely

183
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:42,026
followed by quantum machine learning and cryptography use cases.

184
00:11:42,218 --> 00:11:45,600
All these fields, because of their

185
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,282
interdisciplinary nature, very easily affect large industries

186
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,938
like finance, healthcare,

187
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:56,946
engineering, defense, and a lot of others. But at

188
00:11:56,968 --> 00:12:00,594
the same time, we should remember that we are still in the very

189
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:04,542
early stage of this technology. We are facing

190
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:07,846
a lot of technical challenges in getting to a

191
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:11,602
quantum advantage. So although there are a lot of potential

192
00:12:11,666 --> 00:12:15,958
use cases, we are still a long way behind

193
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:19,370
getting a realistic quantum advantage.

194
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,702
A study by McKinsey actually reports the various industry sectors

195
00:12:23,766 --> 00:12:27,546
quantum computing could directly impact in the next five

196
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:31,518
to ten years. And just as I mentioned just before,

197
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,438
use cases in optimization and life sciences tend to be

198
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:39,086
the emerging frontrunner. But the important thing to note over

199
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:43,582
here is that, in fact, every major industry

200
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:47,762
is bound to get affected in some way or the other by

201
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:50,340
quantum computing. In the long run.

202
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,514
The potential of quantum computing are vast and

203
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:57,990
really varied. But let me now talk about

204
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,670
some of the specific industrial case studies to

205
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,882
try and give you a better understanding of the impact

206
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:08,390
quantum computing can have on the industries.

207
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,666
And one of the most promising applications, like I have time and

208
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,170
again, is organizations.

209
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,814
The traditional computers struggle to solve

210
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:23,866
complex optimization problems due to their linear processing

211
00:13:23,898 --> 00:13:27,306
power, but quantum computers, on the other hand, can handle

212
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:29,870
these problems exponentially faster.

213
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,446
Companies could use quantum computing to potentially

214
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:38,530
optimize the delivery routes and reduce the traffic and

215
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,050
transportation cost. That is exactly

216
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,146
what Volkswagen has demonstrated recently. Using quantum computers,

217
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:49,542
they were able to create a very smart traffic management system,

218
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,286
which provided effective public transport station support

219
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:56,770
across the city. On a different note,

220
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,340
again using optimization, quantum South, a company based,

221
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,958
solved the optimization problem of distributing cargo

222
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:09,660
in an aircraft. Indeed a very interesting use case.

223
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,362
But the underlying fact is that optimization is a very broad term

224
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:18,222
and these kind of optimization problems can be very easily translated to

225
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:21,290
a lot of other industries. Optimization,

226
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:25,026
like speaking in layman terms,

227
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:29,026
optimizing anything and everything, eventually boils down to

228
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,314
maybe minimizing a cost function, which chain be performed better

229
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:37,254
using quantum computers. So I would say,

230
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:40,326
looking for a better workplace timetable for your

231
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:44,194
employees? Go quantum. Looking to improve your goods

232
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:47,422
delivery schedules? Again, go quantum.

233
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:51,898
And basically any kind of optimization or logistics problem,

234
00:14:52,064 --> 00:14:55,770
go quantum. Or I would say at least try quantum.

235
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,974
Another example is of pharmaceutical industries where

236
00:15:02,032 --> 00:15:05,646
using quantum computing to accelerate drug discoveries by

237
00:15:05,668 --> 00:15:09,114
simulating molecular interactions at an unprecedented

238
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:12,426
level of accuracy, quantum computers

239
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:16,254
are able to simulate molecules and simulate molecular

240
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:20,514
interactions at a much more accurately than the

241
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,220
traditional ways which we have been doing so far.

242
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,638
This allows for a rapid identification of

243
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:31,954
maybe potentially new drugs to treat various diseases,

244
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:35,846
cure a lot of the medical problems which we

245
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,286
currently face. And this drug

246
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:43,514
discovery might seem to be a very industry specific use case,

247
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:47,322
which is no doubt being actively pursued by large companies

248
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:50,842
like Fujitsu. But the underlying chemical

249
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:53,982
simulations using quantum computing might

250
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,322
hold the key to unlock large opportunities in various

251
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:00,526
industries, because once we are able to simulate the

252
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:04,580
chemistry, even in its most natural form,

253
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,486
factory chemistry, food technology, material science,

254
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:13,486
even nanotechnology, all that gets changed.

255
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:17,314
And this change in various

256
00:16:17,362 --> 00:16:21,606
industries at the same time could impact most of

257
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:26,034
the industries we know of today. Financial institutions

258
00:16:26,082 --> 00:16:29,734
could also use quantum computing to optimize their portfolio

259
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:33,526
management systems and manage their risk analysis.

260
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:37,494
And one such example which I would like to highlight today is of Morgan

261
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:41,126
and case, which have been using quantum computing

262
00:16:41,158 --> 00:16:44,494
to optimize their financial portfolios. They do this

263
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:48,170
by analyzing large amounts of data and running maybe some complex

264
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,470
algorithms and simulations on quantum computers to identify

265
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,338
the best investment opportunities, reduce risk in

266
00:16:56,344 --> 00:17:00,446
their portfolios, and ultimately result in significant

267
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,046
cost reduction, savings and obviously improved

268
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,094
returns for their clients. Great, right?

269
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:10,726
Make money out of quantum and moving on to

270
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:14,120
the final, but a very important caveat. I will say

271
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,850
using quantum computing is its effect

272
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,766
on the existing security. Quantum computers

273
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:25,174
have the potential to be like extremely, extremely powerful

274
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:28,746
machines, but this unfortunately comes with

275
00:17:28,768 --> 00:17:32,266
the risk of disrupting the existing communication and encryption

276
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:36,046
protocols. While honestly we are

277
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,278
still decades away from an actual quantum computing, being able to

278
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:43,346
hack into our existing security. But the best time to start working on

279
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:47,058
presents such a scenario in the future is now,

280
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:51,170
right? Id quantique led the movement towards

281
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,426
quantum communication protocols to replace the existing classical ones

282
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:59,282
last decade and since then, there has been a lot of improvements

283
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,898
on post quantum cryptography architectures, commonly known

284
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:06,454
as PQC architectures, to secure the data of today

285
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:11,174
from the threat of tomorrow. Companies like Sandbox

286
00:18:11,222 --> 00:18:14,982
AQ recently demonstrated that PQC security systems

287
00:18:15,126 --> 00:18:18,602
by pairing with software, yet another example

288
00:18:18,656 --> 00:18:23,230
of quantum computing making a significant impact in the existing industries.

289
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,682
Yes, I mean with all these examples,

290
00:18:26,746 --> 00:18:29,600
yes, quantum computers are the future.

291
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,466
But again, I would remind you to stay clear of

292
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:38,066
the hype. You need to get ready for

293
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:41,790
the quantum revolutionizing. But by staying well informed

294
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,694
and staying clear of all the nonsense floating

295
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,806
around quantum computing, it's very easy to jump on

296
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,710
the hype train. But that is a very dangerous part to pursue

297
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,358
because you have now understand what quantum can do. It is important

298
00:18:56,444 --> 00:19:00,326
to actually get well educated about the same too. You need

299
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:04,146
to understand the underlying principles which majorly

300
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:08,678
govern the quantum technology. You need to understand what are the various risks involved.

301
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:12,782
You need to understand the scope of a quantum advantage which you might expect

302
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:16,542
in the future, which is all

303
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:20,570
necessary to eventually make you well equipped

304
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,690
to take decisions within your organizations regarding anything quantum

305
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,738
and this is where womanium can help in

306
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:32,190
the quantum sector. Womanium maybe host

307
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,782
an annual month long quantum workforce training

308
00:19:35,836 --> 00:19:39,330
program, partnering with over 50 national research labs,

309
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,742
academic institutions and quantum companies. And this

310
00:19:42,796 --> 00:19:46,598
program is specifically designed to make you

311
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:50,714
industry ready by providing you hands on training in

312
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:54,618
advanced quantum technologies. This is,

313
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:59,078
I would say an advanced quantum program. It is typically

314
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:02,810
long, it is very thorough, it is providing you in depth knowledge,

315
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,618
and typically it is suited for students or maybe professionals

316
00:20:06,714 --> 00:20:09,998
who are looking to work at the technical side or maybe the research domain of

317
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:13,730
quantum computing. The registration of program is actually

318
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,074
open right now. The link should be somewhere down

319
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:21,438
below. It's basically womanium.org

320
00:20:21,614 --> 00:20:24,498
quantum if you do not see the link down below.

321
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:28,002
And yeah, if anyone of the tech

322
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:31,522
side is viewing this session right now, please feel free to enroll

323
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:35,286
in this year's annual session. But you

324
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:39,210
coming back to you, the executives, the high level professionals,

325
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,060
you don't need to know all this technical stuff.

326
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,666
You don't need to nerd yourself out right now, as I

327
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:51,850
said before. Instead, for professionals,

328
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,914
for investors, maybe policymakers and industry

329
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:59,374
leaders like you, you need a different

330
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:02,898
type of education. And that is where we offer an executive education

331
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:07,006
course. Now, this course is delivered by industry experts

332
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:10,766
on your demand and is customized according

333
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,798
to your needs and requirements, right from the course content

334
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:18,678
to the course duration. Everything we

335
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:22,678
tailor make it for you, for your organization's need

336
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:26,086
for your specific requirements. So since this is

337
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:29,494
an on demand course, we conduct it on

338
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:32,730
a rolling basis throughout the year. If you are interested

339
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,506
in such a kind of course, please get in touch with us. I would love

340
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,962
to discuss it more. You should find my email

341
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:43,710
again somewhere below down here or maybe at the end of this presentation.

342
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,742
And yeah, please feel free to reach out and I would love to discuss

343
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:51,182
it with you. But the final thing which I wanted to discuss

344
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:55,306
the most is something which I'm really excited about, which personally

345
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:58,990
excites me the most, is the quantum solutions launchpad.

346
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,674
What is it? I'll talk about that in a moment, but before that

347
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:06,178
I'd like to talk about why did we have to introduce

348
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:09,282
such thing? Over time, we realized that quantum

349
00:22:09,346 --> 00:22:12,754
computing is a very interdisciplinary

350
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:16,598
field and even with all the essential education at

351
00:22:16,604 --> 00:22:20,042
the corporate level, companies are facing a very hard

352
00:22:20,096 --> 00:22:23,754
time taking the first step

353
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:27,194
in quantum computing. And to solve this, we had to

354
00:22:27,232 --> 00:22:30,990
introduce this quantum solutions launchpad where we help

355
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,430
and provide full stack quantum solutions

356
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,014
to get you

357
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:41,946
started on building your first quantum project for your organizations.

358
00:22:42,138 --> 00:22:46,180
And again, all this is customized to your professional needs.

359
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,814
I hate to repeat that again, but if you're interested in any of these programs,

360
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:54,274
get in touch with me ASAP. Become I end I wanted

361
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:57,954
to take a moment and talk a bit more about what the quantum solutions launchpad

362
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:01,746
exactly is and why should you maybe collaborate

363
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:05,430
with us and join us. So as executives,

364
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,686
I feel it is very important to recognize that quantum computing

365
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:12,986
is not standalone solution, but it is

366
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:16,534
rather an ecosystem that requires collaborations and partnerships.

367
00:23:16,582 --> 00:23:20,586
And that is a fact no one will deny, because the complexity

368
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:24,734
of quantum computing solutions and quantum itself is

369
00:23:24,772 --> 00:23:29,082
such that it demands a multidisciplinary approach involving

370
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:32,930
experts in all sorts of fields, from physics to computer

371
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,810
science, mathematics, even life sciences,

372
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,998
optimization specialists, machine learning experts, all sorts

373
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:43,806
of things. So the first step would be to ideally build a diverse

374
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:46,790
team with all the necessary skill sets.

375
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,510
Tough, right? But with the quantum solutions launchpad, you get

376
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,910
access to a truly global remote quantum workforce.

377
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,986
We recruit the best talents from all over the world for

378
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:03,962
you so that you never have to worry about the logistics on maybe

379
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:07,834
onboarding different people with the right skills from all

380
00:24:07,872 --> 00:24:11,694
across the globe. You don't need to worry about that because the team which we

381
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:15,466
select to work on your problem will be the best team tailor

382
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:18,330
made for your problem. Secondly,

383
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,350
because of a unique position in our quantum ecosystem,

384
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,574
we can provide you with an honest opinion. We can provide you with an unbiased

385
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:30,222
opinion of the various quantum service providers

386
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:33,810
that maybe you can find best

387
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,520
for long term collaborations. And this

388
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,614
would include all the industry technical vendors, all the

389
00:24:42,652 --> 00:24:46,694
research institutions, all the other organizations that

390
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:51,402
help provide quantum services which

391
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:56,060
may be complementary to the project you're working on. You would

392
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,038
never have to worry about the technical details when you're

393
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:03,866
partnering with us of maybe which Quantum SDK

394
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:08,078
to pay for, which quantum hardware service to subscribe to.

395
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:11,226
You don't need to worry about that when you are working at the quantum solutions

396
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:14,866
launchpad, because we take care of that. We take care of all

397
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,580
the confusing hard decisions with input from

398
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,866
very good industrial expert team we have. We help you choose the

399
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,726
best quantum vendors suitable for the quantum project designed for

400
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:30,200
your industry. And all this

401
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,202
by being budget friendly. Since we are nonprofit,

402
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:38,502
if you remember, all the funds which we receive go back towards

403
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:41,962
student scholarships. And that is why we don't charge anything.

404
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:45,686
We don't want to keep anything in our pockets if everything we receive

405
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:50,218
goes back to training the future quantum workforce because

406
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:53,438
of this budget friendly approach that we have.

407
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:57,454
This essentially minimizes the risks involved for you as a company in

408
00:25:57,492 --> 00:26:00,250
taking the first step and getting started with quantum.

409
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,600
That is what our partners love so much about us.

410
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,498
And finally the best part, you take away

411
00:26:08,664 --> 00:26:12,660
the entire quantum project we develop for you

412
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,350
with all the IP rights and 100%

413
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,310
of the ownership, no strings attached.

414
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,902
Great, right? Yeah. So just to summarize it,

415
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:28,870
by partnering with the Quantum Solutions launchpad, you can accelerate

416
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,582
the development and the deployment of your quantum computing solutions,

417
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:35,926
while also mitigating the risk and reducing

418
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:39,962
the cost. Just to remind you and repeat myself
