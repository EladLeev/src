00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,114
Hey there. Tim Davis, DevOps advocate with M Zero and this is tag

2
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:35,554
your it. So I am a DevOps advocate

3
00:01:35,602 --> 00:01:38,902
and what that means is that I get to create content and speak to people

4
00:01:38,956 --> 00:01:42,622
like yourself. I want to thank the comp 42 folks for

5
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:46,718
having me. Really. I can't do my job if I can't help

6
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:49,902
show up at conferences and teach people things.

7
00:01:50,036 --> 00:01:53,086
This isn't my first conf fourty two that I've gotten to talk at,

8
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:56,478
so I'm really glad to be back. Before doing what I'm

9
00:01:56,494 --> 00:01:59,906
doing now, I kind of did the same thing for VMware and the cloud and

10
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:03,330
developer advocacy team. And before that I was a pre sales

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,350
se in the networking and security business unit. And before that

12
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,374
I just did pretty much a bunch of infrastructure stuff.

13
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:14,390
Everything from basic systems administration, infrastructure architecture.

14
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,650
The overall arch of my career has been

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,850
on the infrastructure side. Now these days

16
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,702
I think it gives me a nice view into the DevOps

17
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:29,466
space. I know a lot of folks tend to

18
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,138
look more on the developer side of the house,

19
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:35,534
but coming from the infrastructure side, especially getting into

20
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,878
architecture, I learned that you're not just delivering infrastructure for the

21
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:42,880
sake of infrastructure, you're delivering it for the application that runs the business.

22
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,914
So I've made sure to always keep the application top

23
00:02:46,952 --> 00:02:50,446
of mind. That's always been kind of what I've been focused

24
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:54,500
on in my job throughout history and up until now.

25
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,474
So this is tagurit. We are talking about tagging.

26
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:02,530
But really, what is tagging?

27
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,874
I'm sure youre heard this before, I'm sure you've

28
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:08,958
seen it. Anytime you've deployed a resource,

29
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:12,714
I'm sure you have ignored it exactly as

30
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:16,394
I have in the past as well. If we want to break

31
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:19,866
it down as easily as possible, a tag is just

32
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:23,982
a filter. It's a tiny piece of metadata that is attached to

33
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,850
a cloud resource that can help you filter

34
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,690
when you're searching for stuff. Now, there's lots of different reasons

35
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,634
why you would want to have those filters set up,

36
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:39,090
why you would be searching for certain resources in a certain

37
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,478
way, but to just break it down easily.

38
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:46,394
A tag is a filter. It's not going to affect

39
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:50,130
how your infrastructure is deployed, it's not going to affect

40
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,734
what's deploying on it. It's just a little thing that tells you

41
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:57,410
what it is. You can find it

42
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,002
in pretty much every major infrastructure platform these

43
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:04,282
days. All of youre major clouds, all of

44
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:07,660
your private clouds and everything like that.

45
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,754
Pretty much everything has tags available. Now that

46
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:15,854
doesn't mean that every single resource is taggable because there are certain

47
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:19,486
types of resources that aren't, but most of

48
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:23,250
the ones that you're probably using, if not all the ones you're probably using,

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,474
are taggable resources so you can affix this information

50
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:30,980
and that'll allow you to more easily find that.

51
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,358
So why should you care?

52
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:39,254
What do you have to gain from what

53
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,982
seems like adding extra work to whatever

54
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:44,680
you're already doing?

55
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,194
Well, you're going to make your life easier by

56
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:52,726
making their lives easier. Folks in finance

57
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:56,442
who are trying to run reports, figuring out how

58
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,406
much the developer teams are costing, how much the infrastructure teams

59
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:04,074
are costing, how much application a costs.

60
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:07,626
Are we spending too much money this month on databases?

61
00:05:07,738 --> 00:05:11,866
How much are all of those lambda functions that we're using all the time costing?

62
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,378
What are these lambda functions that you keep talking about all

63
00:05:15,384 --> 00:05:19,534
the time? The finance folks? If you're utilizing tagging,

64
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:23,198
it's a lot easier to run, more complex,

65
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,838
easier to view, and better to understand

66
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:30,982
financial reports so that everybody can make sure

67
00:05:31,036 --> 00:05:34,454
that you're not overspending, that there are certain

68
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:37,954
teams that aren't going crazy with resources. It'll just

69
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:41,322
overall put you in a better financial spot if you're able to youre

70
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:44,762
easily run reports and categorize workloads into

71
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:48,154
who's using it. What about security?

72
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:51,886
From a security standpoint, what resources are deployed out

73
00:05:51,908 --> 00:05:55,870
there? Do we have certain resources that are connected to this

74
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,710
insecure VPC that should be connected to this other VPC

75
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,742
working with security to figure out what's out there, what it's talking to,

76
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,970
what it's connected to, why it's out there, what it's running on. It can

77
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,362
absolutely help you have an easier life

78
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,514
simply because they're not just going to keep bugging you of, hey, what is this

79
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:17,714
thing? What is it doing? If there's tags there,

80
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:21,106
they can click on that resource, they can see exactly what's happening. Or if youre

81
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:24,982
generating reports off of what's out there, they can quickly go through,

82
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:28,514
filter that and see what's happening. Let's not

83
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:32,202
forget, of course, though, the middle managers that are

84
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:35,754
desperately trying to justify their existence, we always have to look

85
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,986
out for the middle managers. Having all

86
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:42,622
of these tags can help them run report after report after

87
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:46,494
report to make sure that they can justify that they

88
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:50,366
absolutely have to be here and that they are absolutely essential to

89
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:53,380
the operations that we know that they are.

90
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,994
Anyways, long story short, helping to

91
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:03,518
be able to run faster reporting, answer questions faster,

92
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:07,198
tell the finance folks what's running that's costing

93
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:10,598
them money, the security folks, what's connected to what and what's talking to what and

94
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:14,006
what it is. These are things that can absolutely help you have

95
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,720
a better and easier time.

96
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,370
So you like easy. You like the idea of this,

97
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,514
but how you've already got so much stuff

98
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,140
deployed out into the cloud,

99
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,622
it seems like a big job. How do you go from having no

100
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:36,094
tags to tagging everything and getting where youre want

101
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:39,918
to be? It can definitely seem like it's a

102
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:43,774
big task, but that's pretty much the same for all

103
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:47,614
things DevOps. Getting organized is a big

104
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:50,530
piece of this. A lot of folks think that DevOps is just,

105
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,598
hey, I'm going to throw a tool in here like, oh, we have a CI

106
00:07:53,614 --> 00:07:56,982
CD pipeline now we're doing DevOps. And that's just not the case.

107
00:07:57,036 --> 00:08:00,982
DevOps is like the combination of people, process and

108
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:04,790
tooling that kind of come together and help

109
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,294
everybody be more successful. And that's the same

110
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:12,346
thing here. You're not just throwing a tool at it to try to

111
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:16,730
solve this problem. You have to get the people and the process

112
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,202
on board and then you can use tooling to help

113
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:23,546
solve this problem. Remember, DevOps is a marathon.

114
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:26,334
It's not a sprint. Get it?

115
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:29,694
Anyways, you're not going through and you're not going to be able to get to

116
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:33,266
this crazy DevOps Nirvana in a day.

117
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:37,266
It doesn't work that way. Going from what

118
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:40,914
some say, legacy or just whatever you're doing today to

119
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:43,940
become more efficient and more DevOps in the future,

120
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,200
it's not something you can just snap your fingers and have done.

121
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,926
It's all about baby steps now. That doesn't mean

122
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:55,158
that youre going to take a million little steps and it's going

123
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:58,554
to take you forever. It just means that you have to take one little step

124
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:02,086
at a time and change one thing. So let's

125
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:05,226
take today from today on,

126
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:09,354
start tagging every single new resource that you have

127
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:12,602
deployed into your environment. Just start right then.

128
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:15,454
What that's going to do is that's going to make it so the backlog of

129
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:19,578
resources that you already have deployed into your environment isn't going to get any bigger.

130
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:23,246
So you'll be able to slowly work on that backlog and get caught up,

131
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:26,866
but you won't be adding on new stuff and making that bigger and

132
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:29,666
bigger because you're just tagging everything from now on.

133
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:33,282
Now youre also have baby steps in how

134
00:09:33,336 --> 00:09:36,754
you're going to add your tagging. You're not just going to go through and

135
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:40,006
I mean, maybe youre do start today and just tag everything of this

136
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:43,458
is prod. This is a database. This has this installed on it. This is connected

137
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,534
to this. This is high security. This is low security. Youre can

138
00:09:46,572 --> 00:09:50,214
absolutely start doing that. Make sure that you set a nice tagging structure

139
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:55,082
first before you start doing that. But what about the backlog application

140
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:59,094
rationalization and kind of figuring out what is deploying, why it's deployed,

141
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:02,362
what it's running and everything like that? That's a big, big deal.

142
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:05,582
A lot of companies don't necessarily know what all they have

143
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:08,974
deployed. So figuring all that out, it can be a big,

144
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:12,606
daunting task. You don't have to do it all at once. A lot of

145
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:16,574
folks have like production resources split

146
00:10:16,622 --> 00:10:20,046
into one cloud or on one account and dev resources

147
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,166
and QA. Why don't youre just take the baby steps?

148
00:10:23,198 --> 00:10:26,962
First of finding all your production resources, tagging them as

149
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:30,642
environment for the key and then for the value as prod.

150
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:34,178
Bam, all of youre prod stuff is tagged as prod.

151
00:10:34,354 --> 00:10:37,782
Do that for the dev, do that for the QA staging. However many different

152
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:41,290
environment stages you have, just go and tag those with what they are.

153
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,114
That's a great first step. Next step, maybe take all your web

154
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:48,294
servers, tag those as all as web servers, or take all your databases,

155
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:51,962
tag all those, kind of start moving inward of hey,

156
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:55,566
what environment this is in? What is the main function? What is

157
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,862
it running? The answer

158
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:03,386
of what tags you should have and how many. The answer is always, it depends.

159
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:06,606
We're engineers. That's how it works. So I can't tell you

160
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:09,826
what your tagging structure will look like. I can't tell you the best way to

161
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:13,714
do that. But really, just think about it one little step at a time.

162
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:17,698
Change that people and process of from now on, let's tag everything

163
00:11:17,864 --> 00:11:20,822
and then you can go through and start working on the other stuff.

164
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:24,802
But what about the tooling? You want to be lazy?

165
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:28,246
You want to do it even easier because we all like to

166
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:30,906
automate things and do stuff so that we don't have to do it again and

167
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:34,506
we can go just do something else. Well, there's an

168
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,442
answer for that. Automating tagging these days

169
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:42,438
is pretty easy, especially if you're using infrastructure as code, like terraform.

170
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,918
There's your from bridge crew, there's terra tag by m zero.

171
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:49,518
If you're using AWS with terraform, there's the default tags that you

172
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:53,034
can add straight into there. If youre using Pulumi, then you can add tags

173
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:56,814
there. If you're in Azure, you can utilize Powershell, vMware.

174
00:11:56,862 --> 00:12:00,354
There's power Cli, all of these different tools that can help

175
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:04,954
you automation the tagging process, not just from automating the deployments

176
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:08,550
from now on, but also working through those backlogs.

177
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,662
Go through and find all of those resources and

178
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:16,562
update them and allow those tags to be added systematically.

179
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:20,578
So we always want to make sure that we're making our lives easier

180
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:24,106
by possibly having to do a little bit more today to

181
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:28,074
get there. But future you is going to be really happy with

182
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:31,222
you because now you don't have to get hassled for reports

183
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:34,686
or answer a bunch of questions. You're now being able to provide

184
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:38,026
all of this information a lot more easily

185
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:40,720
so that you can go off and do a lot cooler things.

186
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,618
Remember, work hard today to be super lazy tomorrow.

187
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:47,970
That's the best way of going about it in my mind. I have no problem

188
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,314
going out of my way today so that I don't have to do that again

189
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:55,242
tomorrow or the next day or the next day. Just taking those repeatable

190
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:57,750
processes and making your life easier.

191
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,430
Utilizing this tiny little tag thing that you've been

192
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,360
looking at or possibly avoiding up until now,

193
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,520
you could end up saving yourself a ton of time.

194
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,994
Feel free to reach out on Twitter at vtimd.

195
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:16,726
That's probably the fastest way to get a hold of me because I'm on

196
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:18,710
there wasting away constantly.

197
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,430
But feel free to look up tagging. If you have questions or anything,

198
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,266
feel free to let me know. And I appreciate you checking out the session.

199
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:27,100
Have a great day.
