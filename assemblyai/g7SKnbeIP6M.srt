1
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,774
What on earth could DevOps and fly phishing possibly have

2
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:46,674
in common? How could they be related? And how does sociotechnical

3
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:50,510
engineering have anything to do with fly phishing? Hello. Hello, everyone.

4
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,806
I'm glad you could all join me today. Today we're going to talk about the

5
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:57,198
two things I love, phishing and DevOps. We're going

6
00:00:57,204 --> 00:01:01,086
to talk about how they could possibly be related, how we cold possibly learn

7
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:04,874
about one from the other, and we're going to learn a little bit about sociotechnical

8
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:08,066
engineering along the way. I think we're going to have some fun with

9
00:01:08,088 --> 00:01:11,822
this one, so let's just jump right in. My name is Brian Walter,

10
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:15,246
and I've spent the last 27 years building technical teams

11
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:18,614
and complex architectures. I've had the privilege of working on

12
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:22,022
some very large systems at scale, and now I'm currently building

13
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:25,826
a company called Open Context. We're a platform for auto discovering

14
00:01:25,858 --> 00:01:29,590
and understanding your organization's sociotechnical map,

15
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:33,306
a real time view into the contextual relationships between people,

16
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:36,620
code, infrastructure, security, and services.

17
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,694
Now, I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, and as you imagine,

18
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:44,990
probably by the name of this talk, I absolutely love to fish.

19
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,426
I love being on the river. I love the bugs. I love the fish.

20
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,914
I love being cold. I love the boats. If it's fishing,

21
00:01:51,962 --> 00:01:54,994
boating or water related, rain or shine, any of those things,

22
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:58,574
I'm probably your guy. I fished all over North

23
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:01,822
America, British Columbia, Alaska, Montana, Wyoming,

24
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:05,730
Oregon, Idaho, Washington. I love to travel to fish,

25
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,666
but my home waters are here in the northwest, specifically the north

26
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:12,726
coast of Oregon. I've lived in a cabin just

27
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:17,030
outside the small coastal town of Tillamook, Oregon, on the banks of the Wilson river.

28
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,930
Now, the Wilson is an incredible steelhead and salmon river. In the

29
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,314
winter, this was my home in the pictures here. And while

30
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,770
its remoteness trades off some of the major conveniences of city

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,890
life, it lets me be by the water constantly.

32
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,798
I've also been around this DevOps thing for quite a while, and as I

33
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:37,866
draw on my experiences from the two of the most important aspects

34
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:41,726
of my life, phishing and DevOps, I keep finding a connection and

35
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:46,254
an intersection between the two, overlapping between two seemingly

36
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:49,666
unrelated and different worlds. I could have

37
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:52,846
named this talk sociotechnical engineering for DevOps,

38
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,338
but then all the cool fish pictures wouldn't have made sense. So today we're going

39
00:02:56,344 --> 00:03:00,054
to talk about those connections and hopefully entertain you along the way.

40
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:03,426
We're going to start our journey into sociotechnical engineering

41
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,526
at my old home on Oregon's Wilson river. Now, the Wilson is

42
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:10,730
a coastal tributary of Oregon's Tillamuk Bay.

43
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,206
Several different rivers flow into the waters of Tillamuk Bay and the Wilson's, the largest

44
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:18,506
of them home to Chinook salmon both in

45
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:22,306
the fall and the spring, coho salmon in the fall, steelhead in the winter,

46
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:25,854
and sea run cutthroat trout through the late summer and fall.

47
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:29,694
Additionally, there's native trout that call the Wilson home all year long.

48
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,926
Now, I love the Wilson river, but I'm not

49
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:36,254
the only one. Its close proximity to the Portland

50
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:39,634
metro area and its fantastic fisheries have made

51
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:43,326
it a hugely popular destination for fisher people, swimmers,

52
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:46,350
boaters, and countless other groups who enjoy the river.

53
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,558
If you're on the west side of town, the Wilson is by far one of

54
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:53,286
the easiest rivers to access from Portland, the Wilson has been on

55
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:56,530
its own journey, a journey of being loved to death.

56
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,846
As Portland has grown, by the 1980s and 1990s,

57
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:03,110
the Chinook coho and steelhead trout fisheries were dwindling.

58
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,794
Use of the river was at an all time high, with its

59
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:10,314
fisheries collapsing due to pressure. Something had to be done.

60
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:14,750
Salmon runs were down by 80% by the year 2000, and steelhead, the same

61
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,542
harvest had been taking its whole, taking its toll, as had

62
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:22,110
logging and habitat loss throughout the estuary. Reforms were needed

63
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,506
in so many different areas. One of those

64
00:04:25,528 --> 00:04:28,994
reforms we're going to talk about next. Today, more than

65
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:32,866
half of the salmon and steelhead runs in Tillamook Bay are born here at

66
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:36,286
the Whiskey Creek volunteer hatchery. A fish hatchery

67
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,010
is a place where salmon and steelhead are collected from the river,

68
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,646
artificially spawned and bred to grow thousands upon thousands of

69
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:46,962
baby fish. Those fish are put back into the ecosystem and ultimately

70
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:50,426
contribute to the populations of the river. Located just

71
00:04:50,448 --> 00:04:54,534
to the south in Nitart's Bay, the Whiskey Creek hatchery is almost entirely

72
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:58,470
volunteer run, grassroots supported, and absolutely vital

73
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,346
to the success of the north coast fisheries. But operating

74
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:06,270
a fish hatchery in the northwest is extremely complicated.

75
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,682
There are incredible politics involved, environmental concerns,

76
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:13,834
policies to follow, special interest groups to appease,

77
00:05:13,962 --> 00:05:17,662
as well as the demands on the best possible science and practices

78
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:21,826
to ensure the correct impacts, that we're not actually damaging the ecosystem we

79
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:25,374
so love. It's not just about the creation of hatchery

80
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:29,094
fish, but being confident that the impacts to the wildfish that we

81
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:32,978
dearly love are safe beyond all these concerns, it turns

82
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:36,754
out that simply operating these fish hatcheries is extremely

83
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:40,346
complicated in its own right. Today, more than a

84
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:44,406
dozen different state, federal, tribal government agencies,

85
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:48,026
international government agencies. Yep, the canadian treaties are part

86
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:52,186
of this, too. Local fishery advocacy groups environmental groups

87
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,786
and commercial interests all weigh in on how fisheries

88
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:59,120
are managed in the northwest. This has a direct

89
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,270
impact on hatchery plans and operations.

90
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,898
All of these groups have different personalities, people and needs.

91
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:10,734
Some are easy, some are difficult, some are straight up obstinate

92
00:06:10,782 --> 00:06:14,094
and impossible to move. And this is a relatively

93
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:17,666
simple hatchery just to the north on the Columbia river, with the largest

94
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:21,538
salmon run in the world. The complications are even wilder

95
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,286
when you go there. It's ten times more complicated. So what

96
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:29,302
is a small team of highly skilled ecologies

97
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:33,382
and passionate volunteers to do? How can they run their hatchery operation

98
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:37,290
under in such incredibly complicated and complex conditions?

99
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,226
Well, it starts with everyone at the table recognizing that we all love the

100
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:44,734
ecosystem and we all love these fish. We all

101
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,094
want a healthy river system. And at the end of the day, compromise is

102
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:52,042
often the answer. Think of these groups as your stakeholders,

103
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:55,902
your business, your product team, your finance team, your compliance department,

104
00:06:56,046 --> 00:06:59,346
and even your customers. Everyone cares, everyone has

105
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:03,060
a voice, and everyone can make a complete mess of your project.

106
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,762
Starting to sound familiar, right? A highly technical environment

107
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:11,122
with significant regulation, with intense technical

108
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:14,726
demands, and if all goes well, very frequent and

109
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,246
regular deployments of fish. Now, we're not going to dive into

110
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:22,010
how hatcheries operate here. That's not what this presentation would be about.

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,366
But in my learnings, I quickly discovered that the concepts

112
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:28,534
of sociotechnical engineering and the principles of DevOps

113
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,382
exist outside the traditional DevOps field, and we find them in many

114
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:35,854
other areas of life. So with that connection, let's learn

115
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:40,154
a little bit about sociotechnical systems theory. Now, full disclosure,

116
00:07:40,282 --> 00:07:43,662
I don't profess to be an expert in sociotechnical theory. I'm learning

117
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:47,870
this too. I'm learning from our mentors, folks like John Willis and Andrew Clay Schaefer

118
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,474
and James Wicket, folks that have published incredible works and

119
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,946
helped define the DevOps movement. If you want to go deep on

120
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:58,790
that subject, John Willis's new book on edward stemming is a great

121
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,882
place to start. And presentations from Andrew Clay Schaefer are fantastic

122
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:05,400
as well. But at a high level.

123
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,574
Sociotechnical systems theory starts with this, a holistic

124
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,934
systems view with an emphasizing on the interconnectedness

125
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:16,378
of the components and relationships between all the components of

126
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:19,610
your environment, the people, most importantly the people,

127
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,690
the teams, the code, the infrastructure, et cetera,

128
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,430
feedback loops and continuous learning,

129
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,590
collaboration, shared knowledge, furthering our craft,

130
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,206
adaptive design and evolution, resiliency,

131
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:37,342
anticipatory measures, and most importantly,

132
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:41,266
ethics and human values. We care about our teams. We care

133
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,180
about the impacts to our families. We care about the people.

134
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,846
If these values sound a lot like what we've heard about DevOps over

135
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:51,830
the years. That's because DevOps has its roots in sociotechnical engineering,

136
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,034
much the same way a river system is an incredibly complex ecosystem

137
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:59,446
of interdependent components. So are the environments we operate

138
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:02,934
as DevOps practitioners, with a heavy emphasis

139
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:06,874
on the human element. Sociotechnical engineering underscores the

140
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:10,858
intertwined nature of technology and human systems,

141
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:14,686
urging our DevOps practitioners to ensure that both are in

142
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:18,190
harmony for optimal outcomes. Now,

143
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,110
me, I'm an introvert. How can I be socio anything

144
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,218
if I don't like talking to people? Is it that I

145
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:29,506
don't like talking to people, or is it something more nuanced than that?

146
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:33,086
Simon Sinek draws an analogy of what an introvert versus

147
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:36,674
an extrovert is, as this an introvert is someone

148
00:09:36,712 --> 00:09:40,466
who starts the day with five coins. In every human interaction

149
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:44,978
with another person, those coins are depleted. More human interaction,

150
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:48,614
more depletion. That's why for many of us, we're just exhausted after

151
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:52,006
a conference like this one. Extroverts are the opposite

152
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:55,306
of that. They start the day with no coins, and by

153
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,046
the time they interact with someone, it recharges them. They get a dopamine

154
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:02,286
hit. They get fulfillment out of interacting with others.

155
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,674
It's an addiction almost for them. And without this interaction,

156
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:09,294
they feel drained. Now, I suspect many of you are

157
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:12,998
introverts, and just as we've learned about sociotechnical engineering,

158
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:16,414
we find ourselves in an interesting spot. If DevOps

159
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:19,726
requires such strong interactions between teams,

160
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:23,410
how on earth can I do this without feeling so drained?

161
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,842
I found that tools like asynchronous communication, deliberate writing,

162
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:31,730
and access to real time context maps for our environment crucial

163
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,174
to managing my introversion. Nothing kills me

164
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:38,498
faster than an 80 person conference bridge just to solve

165
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:42,394
an incident. For me, just acknowledging this

166
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:45,882
and having a little empathy for our people goes a long way. But for others,

167
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:49,066
it's more difficult. But either way, empathy goes

168
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:52,746
a long way. So with that background, let's talk about some DevOps

169
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,590
principles and how they could possibly intersect with fly phishing.

170
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,230
Now, if you're at this conference, you're already

171
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,802
somebody who knows a thing or two about DevOps. But if not,

172
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:08,974
here's some of the principles. The essence of systems

173
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:13,170
thinking, feedback and iterative improvement.

174
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,230
Collaboration, shared knowledge,

175
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,160
adaptability and continuous learning.

176
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,738
Resilience through problem solving and ethics,

177
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:26,886
community and sustainability. Now, the essence of systems thinking.

178
00:11:26,988 --> 00:11:31,274
This is understanding the broad complexities of how our systems work,

179
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:34,806
not just the technical components, but also recognizing

180
00:11:34,838 --> 00:11:38,106
that people are part of that system feedback and

181
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:41,534
iterative improvement. This is learning from

182
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:44,686
our experiences and making small changes to improve our

183
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:48,494
systems and improve our practices. Collaboration and

184
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:51,838
shared knowledge it's been said, if you want to go fast,

185
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:55,266
go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.

186
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,260
We're nothing if we don't work together as a team.

187
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,434
Adaptability and continuous learning bottom line,

188
00:12:02,552 --> 00:12:06,454
stuff happens all the time. Our environments can be absolutely

189
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:09,846
crazy. We got to do what we got to do sometimes to

190
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:13,858
get things working. We adapt. And through resilience

191
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:18,146
and problem solving, we know sometimes our problems require

192
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:21,674
just intense focus and commitment. And if it were easy, everyone would

193
00:12:21,712 --> 00:12:24,906
do it. But our ethics and our community and our

194
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:28,554
sustainability are at the forefront. We do the right thing,

195
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,866
we be honorable. We care for our teams, we have empathy for

196
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:35,326
each other. These are the basic DevOps principles we've all come to

197
00:12:35,348 --> 00:12:39,086
know and love. So let's dive in a little bit deeper now.

198
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:42,894
The essence of systems thinking is not just technical

199
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:46,926
dependencies. We're recognizing the intricate interconnection

200
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,354
and relationships between people, process and technology

201
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,226
within an organization. We're emphasizing viewing the

202
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:58,034
entire software development delivery pipeline as a holistic

203
00:12:58,082 --> 00:13:00,898
system rather than isolated components.

204
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:04,834
Systems thinking encourages us to break down silos between development

205
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:08,078
and operational teams, fostering collaboration

206
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:12,106
and treating them as integral parts of the same system with a

207
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:15,894
shared objective. This approach promotes a culture

208
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:19,654
of continuous improvement where feedback loops and proactive

209
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:23,194
problem solving become central. By embracing

210
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:26,894
systems thinking, DevOps practitioners can optimize the flow of work,

211
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,674
enhance communications, and drive innovation,

212
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:34,006
ultimately leading to more efficient, resilient and customer centric

213
00:13:34,058 --> 00:13:37,540
views on how we deliver our software and our services.

214
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,062
Now, when we think about systems thinking, how it could possibly

215
00:13:42,126 --> 00:13:45,426
apply to fly fishing. In fly fishing, we see the river

216
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,666
as a system, water flow, fish behavior, insect cycles

217
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:53,746
successful anglers understand the entire ecosystem from the types

218
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:57,550
of insects fish might eat to water temperature and clarity.

219
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,070
Before setting out, anglers often check weather conditions,

220
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,410
understanding the types of fish in a given location and selecting the right gear.

221
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,054
In DevOps, we recognize the software development lifecycle as

222
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:15,002
a holistic system. From ideation all the way through deployment.

223
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,762
It's essential to have an endtoend view of the software

224
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:22,394
development lifecycle, understanding both development

225
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:26,450
and the operational side. Before deploying code or changes.

226
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,874
Teams prepare by understanding the environment and selecting the right

227
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:34,254
tools and setting up monitoring and alerts. Our sociotechnical

228
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:38,194
connection is deep. How both domains require this understanding

229
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:41,954
of complex systems and how the intricate interplay between the various

230
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:46,098
components comes to light, feedback and iterative improvement

231
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:49,150
are fundamental principles in the realm of DevOps,

232
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,934
DevOps encourages a culture where feedback is not only welcomed,

233
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:57,290
but actively sought at every stage of the software development and deployment lifecycle.

234
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,738
This feedback can come from various sources, including automated testing,

235
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,402
monitoring and end users. By continuously

236
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:09,082
gathering and analyzing feedback, DevOps teams can identify

237
00:15:09,146 --> 00:15:12,754
areas for enhancement and make incremental changes rather

238
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:17,022
than waiting for major overhauls. This iterative approach ensures

239
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:21,202
that software and infrastructure are constantly evolving to meet

240
00:15:21,256 --> 00:15:25,394
changing requirements and challenges. Ultimately, small feedback

241
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,774
driven improvements lead to more reliable, efficient and

242
00:15:28,812 --> 00:15:32,514
customer centric solutions. We're aligning our DevOps

243
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:36,520
practices with the ever evolving demands of our digital world.

244
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,554
Now, fly fishing. How does that connect here?

245
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:44,346
Right, fly fishing we're adjusting our techniques based on success and

246
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:47,926
failures. We're understanding our fish's reaction to different flies.

247
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:51,914
Not every cast results in a catch. Anglers need patience

248
00:15:51,962 --> 00:15:56,330
and the willingness to try different techniques. Anglers constantly

249
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,866
observe currents, constantly observe fish behavior

250
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:03,246
and the effectiveness of their flies and lures, and we adjust our techniques

251
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,414
accordingly for DevOps continuous monitoring,

252
00:16:06,462 --> 00:16:10,290
testing, iterative development and response to system's feedback.

253
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,382
We know that not every deployment is smooth and teams face challenges,

254
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:18,520
but they persist, they troubleshoot and they iteratively improve their process.

255
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,670
We're continuously monitoring the feedback,

256
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,734
we're continuously monitoring our teams, and they're adapting their

257
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:29,514
code to the infrastructure based on the performance, the user feedback and

258
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:32,874
systems alerts. Sociotechnical connection here

259
00:16:32,912 --> 00:16:36,486
is that we're emphasizing the dynamic relationship between tools

260
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:41,002
and equipment, human decisions and actions, and socially

261
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:44,714
we're connecting based on feedback. Without that feedback, we can't

262
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:48,734
improve the system. Collaboration and shared knowledge are

263
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,722
pivotal elements in the DevOps philosophy.

264
00:16:51,866 --> 00:16:55,342
DevOps bridges traditionally distinct worlds of development

265
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:58,706
and operations by fostering a culture of collaboration and

266
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:02,734
open communication. This collaboration encourages developers

267
00:17:02,782 --> 00:17:06,962
and operations teams to work together seamlessly, breaking down silos

268
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,214
and sharing their expertise. The sharing of

269
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:14,034
knowledge and tools and best practices creates a collective intelligence

270
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:17,160
within the organization, a context for learning.

271
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,386
By pooling their insights and experiences, teams can

272
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:25,146
solve problems more effectively and proactively, speeding up

273
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:28,250
development cycles and enhancing system reliability.

274
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,266
In essence, collaboration and shared knowledge are the glue

275
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:36,254
that binds DevOps teams together, enabling them to deliver high

276
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:40,362
quality software efficiently and respond swiftly

277
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:44,154
to the ever changing demands of our business. Now, fly fishing

278
00:17:44,202 --> 00:17:47,998
anglers, we do share knowledge. We share knowledge of good fishing spots,

279
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:51,646
we share knowledge of fly patterns and our techniques. We tie

280
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:54,910
flies and we maintain our equipment as a craft.

281
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,814
Often this craft is honed over many, many years,

282
00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:00,338
and while it can be a solitary activity,

283
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:03,510
anglers often share chips and favorite fishing

284
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,120
spots and techniques with the community.

285
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,654
Now, DevOps crossfunctional collaboration and sharing insights across development,

286
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:15,210
operations and other departments. We write good code,

287
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,694
creating efficient pipelines and ensuring that systems

288
00:18:18,742 --> 00:18:21,200
resilience is a craft in its own right.

289
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,674
Collaboration between development, operations and even business units

290
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,586
is fundamental to the DevOps philosophy.

291
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:32,286
Now, both tools and platforms for sharing in the technical and

292
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:35,474
the culture of collaboration in the social will influence our

293
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,954
outcomes. I think that's clear now.

294
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,474
Adaptability and continuous learning in the fast paced and ever

295
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:45,006
evolving world of tech, DevOps teams remain agile and

296
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:48,038
adaptable. They're committed to embracing change,

297
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:51,794
whether it's in the form of new tools, methodologies, or shifting

298
00:18:51,842 --> 00:18:54,886
business requirements. Continuous learning is

299
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:57,030
a cornerstone of this adaptability.

300
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,774
DevOps practitioners are dedicated to staying

301
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:04,810
updated with the latest industry trends, ecologies and best practices.

302
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,614
They understand what works today may not work tomorrow,

303
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:12,126
so they continuously seek opportunities to enhance their skills and

304
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:15,962
knowledge. This commitment to adaptability and learning ensures

305
00:19:16,026 --> 00:19:20,270
that DevOps teams are well equipped to respond to emerging challenges.

306
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,378
They innovate effectively and they deliver value to their organization with

307
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:28,158
a resilience and agility. Now, on a river,

308
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,954
we can go from the view on the left to the view on the right

309
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:35,554
in a matter of hours. Change happens with

310
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,678
or without you being ready for it. We have to be prepared and we have

311
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:41,320
to adapt. And your business is no different.

312
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,334
In fly fishing, we're constantly modifying our strategies based

313
00:19:45,372 --> 00:19:49,270
on changing environmental conditions and our learned experiences.

314
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,414
Anglers often experiment with different flies, casting techniques,

315
00:19:53,462 --> 00:19:57,034
fishing locations, and depending on the time of the day, the type

316
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:01,054
of fish in the water and the conditions. We change our tactics in

317
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:04,334
DevOps, adapting to new tools and methodologies and

318
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:08,046
best practices in this ever evolving tech landscape. It can

319
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:10,400
drive you crazy, but we do it.

320
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,190
Teams experiment with new tools, deployment strategies,

321
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,630
infrastructure configurations, and we optimize our processes.

322
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,230
Teams need to be agile, adapting to our user requirements,

323
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,290
our system changes, and our unexpected challenges.

324
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,954
Here we have yet another sociotechnical connection,

325
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:31,394
where continuous learning and adaptability is the intersection

326
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:34,882
of evolving technical systems and the people operating

327
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:38,310
within them. Resilience through problem solving

328
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,250
is a critical aspect of DevOps philosophy.

329
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,474
DevOps teams recognize that failures and issues are an

330
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,622
inherent part of complex it systems.

331
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:52,910
And those failures are not always technical. Sometimes they're human.

332
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,538
In fact, often they're human. Instead of merely

333
00:20:56,634 --> 00:21:00,510
trying to avoid problems, we embrace them as opportunities for improvement.

334
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,606
DevOps encourages a proactive approach to problem solving

335
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:08,674
by establishing user feedback loops and using automation for

336
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:12,702
early detection and resolution of issues. This resilience

337
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:15,194
mindset involves learning from failures,

338
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:18,962
documenting our incidents, and continuously improving

339
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:22,726
process to prevent similar problems from reoccurring again.

340
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:26,566
In doing so, DevOps not only encourages the robustness of

341
00:21:26,588 --> 00:21:30,170
our systems, but also fosters a culture of continuous learning

342
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,550
and adaptability, ultimately enhancing an organization's ability

343
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,218
to weather challenges and deliver reliable and high quality

344
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:42,202
software and services. In fly fishing, overcoming challenges

345
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:46,126
like weather is the name of the game. We have elusive fish. We have

346
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:49,566
equipment malfunctions constantly. Sometimes the

347
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:53,358
fish just aren't going to bite. In DevOps,

348
00:21:53,454 --> 00:21:57,134
anticipating and mitigating and quickly recovering from systems failures

349
00:21:57,182 --> 00:22:00,754
and bugs. That's what we do. So our

350
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:04,954
connection here, we're building robust systems, and not just through technical

351
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:08,434
measures, but by leveraging our human creativity and problem solving

352
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:12,402
skills. Ethics, community, and sustainability

353
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:16,370
are increasingly important considerations in the world of DevOps.

354
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,634
DevOps practitioners are recognizing their ethical responsibility to

355
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,886
build and deploy technology that is not only functional, but also considers

356
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:27,958
the broader societal and environmental impacts.

357
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:31,610
DevOps communities are actively sharing knowledge on the best practices

358
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,130
related to ethical considerations, things like data privacy,

359
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,430
security, and responsible AI deployment.

360
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,510
Moreover, sustainability has emerged as a key concern,

361
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,434
with a heavy focus on reducing the carbon footprint of our services and

362
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:50,078
operations. DevOps practices like automation

363
00:22:50,174 --> 00:22:53,854
and efficient resource utilization align with sustainability goals

364
00:22:53,902 --> 00:22:58,134
by reducing waste and energy consumption, not to mention the

365
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:01,682
financial incentives to your business. In essence,

366
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:05,494
DevOps is evolving to encompass this holistic approach that

367
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:09,318
incorporates ethics, community collaboration, and sustainability

368
00:23:09,414 --> 00:23:12,934
principles, ensuring that technology development

369
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:16,390
is not just efficient, but also socially responsible

370
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,718
and environmentally conscious. In fly fishing,

371
00:23:19,814 --> 00:23:23,786
ethical anglers practice catch and release, ensuring minimal

372
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:27,082
impact to the fish populations and impact of the watershed.

373
00:23:27,226 --> 00:23:30,910
Sports people are the greatest contributors to conservation efforts in the United

374
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,290
States by an order of magnitude above any other groups.

375
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,846
We take care of our resources, and we're stewards of the environment.

376
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,414
In DevOps, ethical considerations in software development,

377
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:46,686
like data privacy, security, and user trust, matter teams

378
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:50,354
respect their operational environment, ensuring minimal

379
00:23:50,402 --> 00:23:54,294
downtime, rapid recovery from failure, and sustainable work

380
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:58,258
practices. We care about the health of our wealth and well being of our coworkers

381
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:02,742
and colleagues. We're in this together sociotechnical.

382
00:24:02,806 --> 00:24:06,726
We're navigating the ethical landscape using both technical tools,

383
00:24:06,838 --> 00:24:10,378
policies, and human judgment. We know that people matter,

384
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:13,614
we show empathy, and we're excellent to each other.

385
00:24:13,812 --> 00:24:17,338
So why do I care about all this stuff? So, I'm the co founder

386
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:20,750
of a company called Open Context. We're a real time,

387
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,254
auto discovered, sociotechnical map of your company. I know

388
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:27,586
that's a mouthful, but we help you find someone who can fix a

389
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:31,566
problem in a complex system faster. We graph

390
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:34,882
the relationships between all the things, the people, the code,

391
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:38,486
the infrastructure, the vulnerabilities. We're in

392
00:24:38,508 --> 00:24:43,560
open beta right now, and we'd love your feedback. You can sign up for free@opencontext.com.

393
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,434
So to wrap this up, the aspects of sociotechnical

394
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:51,702
engineering are everywhere, and we permeate so many different

395
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,526
aspects of our lives, not just DevOps. I hope this has been

396
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:59,414
entertaining and I've enjoyed sharing some of what I've learned along the way.

397
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:02,826
If so, sign up for Opencontext and most importantly,

398
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:04,700
go fishing. Thank you.
