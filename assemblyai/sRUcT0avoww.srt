00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:35,186
Sauk,

2
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:38,534
I'm going to take you on the journey of how and why I

3
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:42,246
built a serverless SaaS startup in 30 days

4
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:45,000
and how you can do exactly the same.

5
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,206
I'm Sam and I've been working 100% serverlessly for

6
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:53,054
over five years now. I run complete coding, which is a

7
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:56,394
YouTube channel teaching people to become serverless

8
00:00:56,442 --> 00:01:00,042
developers. And now we even have a full serverless

9
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:03,534
masterclass course which takes you from novice

10
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:07,010
to being able to apply for serverless jobs.

11
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,010
I've always had an entrepreneurial side,

12
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,794
and over time I've tried building startups

13
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,662
and have honestly generated quite a nice list

14
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:22,086
of failed startups. They tend to

15
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:25,126
always be the same. I start building something,

16
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,254
thinking this is an amazing product. I spend evenings

17
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:32,042
and weekends for months working away at it.

18
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:36,198
Eventually I get to the point where I'm ready to launch

19
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:39,946
and then nothing. Sometimes I

20
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:43,486
get a few free users, but I never manage to

21
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:47,406
build something that people are willing to pay for. Spending all

22
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:50,702
of that time and effort for no real reward is

23
00:01:50,756 --> 00:01:53,070
incredibly frustrating and painful.

24
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,906
So I decided that next time would be different. I took

25
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:01,310
a leaf out of Peter Level's book. He gave himself

26
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,942
30 days to test a startup idea from

27
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:09,062
scratch and did one a month, resulting in twelve

28
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:12,822
startups in twelve months. I still have

29
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:16,374
consulting clients and a YouTube channel to run, so I

30
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:19,594
decided to modify this a little bit. I kept the

31
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:23,926
30 day limit built. I decided only to do it four months throughout

32
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:28,122
the year. If I can get a paying user in

33
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:31,886
30 days, then it's a good idea. But if I

34
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:35,934
can't get a paying user, the idea wasn't an idea that's ever

35
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:39,454
going to become a valuable company and I would

36
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,398
move on. Luckily for me,

37
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:46,194
the first 30 day challenge went basically as well as I could have

38
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,146
hoped, getting over 300 users in that month

39
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:53,278
and generating $140 of income.

40
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:56,834
And a month later it hasn't all crashed and burned and we're

41
00:02:56,882 --> 00:03:01,042
still doing over $120 in monthly recurring

42
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:04,582
revenue. There were two things that I really

43
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:07,914
think helped make this a success, and I'll talk

44
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:10,780
about those a little bit more at the end.

45
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,042
So the key challenges for me and

46
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:19,514
for getting paying users in those 30 days come down

47
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:21,680
to basically three things.

48
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,174
So keeping it simple enough that I don't end

49
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:29,486
up with a massive architecture where

50
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:32,830
I'm going to spend all of the 30 days building it,

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,850
and then have no time to actually give users access

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,562
to it, get some real feedback, and actually spend time

53
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:43,906
marketing it. The second is finding a problem that

54
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:47,810
is actually painful enough that people want to

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,574
pay to solve that pain. This is something that I

56
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:54,902
haven't done a great job of in the past, so this is definitely

57
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:58,402
going to be a focus for this one. And thirdly,

58
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:02,362
I'm not a marketer, I am a developer through and through, so building

59
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:05,146
the tech is going to be the least of my problems.

60
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,970
It's going to be about learning how I can try to get

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,382
my ideas and my products in front of as many people

62
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:16,478
as possible. There are loads of ways to find a customer

63
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:19,934
pain point, but for this challenge, it kind of came

64
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:23,434
by accident. So I was scrolling through LinkedIn

65
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:27,342
one day and I saw one of my favorite creators, Luke Matthews,

66
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:31,330
and he was talking about how he would grow

67
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,722
on LinkedIn if he was starting again. So number

68
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:38,342
three was to engage on the posts from five or ten

69
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,830
creators from your niche. And I was like,

70
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,842
that kind of seems obvious when you comment on other people's posts.

71
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:49,754
Then that audience of 83,000 people

72
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:53,574
that you might be seeing from their following

73
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:57,222
will see you. They might either directly subscribe

74
00:04:57,286 --> 00:05:00,910
or follow you, which is amazing. But they might also just like

75
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,542
your comment. And LinkedIn will actually then

76
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,854
show some of your posts to them, even though they're got

77
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:11,162
following you because they've liked one of your comments

78
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:14,114
recently. So this is a great way.

79
00:05:14,152 --> 00:05:17,330
So why isn't everyone doing loads of comments?

80
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,310
And this second post came up from Merco

81
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,038
talking about his normal LinkedIn schedule,

82
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:29,046
and this is what he does on LinkedIn every day. If you can

83
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:32,278
see at the bottom, it says that he spends, on average, one and a

84
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:35,814
half to 2 hours per day commenting on

85
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:39,340
LinkedIn. That is an insane amount of time

86
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,490
if you're running a business, or even if you're just an employee,

87
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:48,794
you can't really justify spending 2 hours of your day,

88
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,910
especially if you look at the times in the middle of the day, in the

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,914
middle of the workday, focusing on commenting when you're

90
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:59,120
either growing your business or trying to just do your job.

91
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,666
Around the same time I had been messing around with chat

92
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:05,874
got, and I knew that it could be

93
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:08,130
insanely powerful if used properly.

94
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,826
Prompt engineering was also starting to become a bit of

95
00:06:11,848 --> 00:06:14,866
a topic, so I knew whatever I could come up with,

96
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:18,870
I could always tweak and improve the outputs.

97
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,878
Wondering how engaging Chat GPT would be at making

98
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:27,590
a LinkedIn comment, I decided to test it out manually.

99
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,866
I found an interesting LinkedIn post that is

100
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:35,594
the kind of thing that I might normally reply to. I then

101
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:39,162
copied it and pasted it into Chat GPT with

102
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:42,634
a little bit of a prompt saying act as a software

103
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:46,590
engineer and write me an engaging LinkedIn comment.

104
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,958
What came back was a little bit long and a

105
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:54,862
little bit wordy, but compared with other automated

106
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:58,514
tools out there, that post oh, great post or

107
00:06:58,632 --> 00:07:01,794
interesting. This comment is amazing.

108
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:05,186
It has depth, it has interesting discussion points,

109
00:07:05,368 --> 00:07:08,520
and from this point on I knew I was onto something.

110
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,566
This is the point where I would normally go

111
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:16,102
into building the solution, spending weeks or months,

112
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:19,814
then launch it, and kind of hope that there was an audience and

113
00:07:19,852 --> 00:07:22,986
there was a customer base. This time was going to be

114
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:26,426
different. I was going to validate the idea more and

115
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:30,170
make sure that it wasn't going to be a complete flop.

116
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,206
So to validate it, there were kind of two

117
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:37,882
topics that I wanted to validate. The first is the technical

118
00:07:37,946 --> 00:07:41,838
validation can I actually build everything I need

119
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:45,874
to deploy this idea? So with

120
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:49,294
this I have a couple of advantages being a serverless

121
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:52,546
developer. On the second point, I wanted to

122
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:55,798
validate that there were actual customers out there

123
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:59,302
and there was enough of them and actually that

124
00:07:59,356 --> 00:08:02,680
they would pay money to solve this problem.

125
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,698
So for technical validation, as I just said, being a serverless developer,

126
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:11,578
I knew I could build APIs and databases from

127
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:15,322
all of the proof of concept projects I've worked on over the last

128
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:18,678
five years. The test with Chat GPT

129
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:22,010
showed that I can generate good comments,

130
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,774
and I can probably improve those further with

131
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:29,502
better prompt engineering down the line. I also

132
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:33,022
knew from other projects that I knew how to create

133
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:36,462
a chrome extension where I could have user login.

134
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:39,854
I could then add buttons to existing websites,

135
00:08:39,982 --> 00:08:43,474
send API requests, and all of the kind of things that I knew

136
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,200
I would need to do to get this working.

137
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,566
If you've never actually deployed a full stack app before,

138
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:54,406
then actually spend some time looking into the best ways to

139
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:58,258
deploy your ideas. It could be serverless code like

140
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:01,402
I did, but also no code or low code

141
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:04,540
tools can be a really good option.

142
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,794
Personally, I like serverless because you have the full control over the

143
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:12,794
custom code, but without the issues of managing

144
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:15,966
server redundancy scaling. Plus you

145
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,294
only pay for what you use. So if it does turn out,

146
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:23,038
unfortunately, there are no paying users. You've also had to

147
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:26,670
pay nothing for the servers that are sitting there idle.

148
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,794
Now onto customer validation and this is where I did

149
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:35,540
some things well and other things I should have done better

150
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,630
in terms of the positive validation I did.

151
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,274
LinkedIn is a growing tool, especially with Twitter recently

152
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:46,006
going through all of its shenanigans. There's a lot of people who are joining the

153
00:09:46,028 --> 00:09:49,706
platform and wanting to grow their audience and

154
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,890
their following whilst boosting their authority.

155
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,062
Both of the posts I saw on LinkedIn

156
00:09:57,206 --> 00:10:01,390
were from either LinkedIn ghostwriters or LinkedIn

157
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,080
basically services who are paid to grow your account.

158
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,606
So that is people already paying them to

159
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,238
grow on LinkedIn. And finally, under both of

160
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:18,242
these posts were loads of comments saying, this sounds great,

161
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:21,906
I want to comment more, but I don't have the time to write all

162
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:25,694
of those comments. This was proof that people both

163
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:29,010
had the pain of I want to grow on LinkedIn,

164
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,880
but they don't have the time.

165
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,510
Now where I should have done a lot better with the customer validation is

166
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,300
actually talking with those potential customers.

167
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,982
I could have messaged all of those people who commented

168
00:10:45,046 --> 00:10:48,762
that they didn't have the time to write those comments and

169
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:52,010
I could have talked with them. I could have found out how much time

170
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,806
do you actually have and why is it that you're wanting to

171
00:10:55,828 --> 00:11:00,046
grow on LinkedIn? And of course I could have found out if

172
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:04,206
you were going to pay for a service that could help you write LinkedIn comments,

173
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,566
how much might you actually pay if you could quarter

174
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:10,450
the time spent writing comments?

175
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,866
Another whole vertical I could have approached was I could

176
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:18,054
have talked with copywriters about whether

177
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:21,894
they would use this tool in their business, and that could have been

178
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:25,926
a whole different focused instead of going directly to

179
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:29,462
the customers, I could have done a more b to b approach,

180
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,982
talking with copywriters and ghost writers,

181
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:36,780
trying to get them to use it to speed up their work.

182
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,582
Now, other ways you can validate your

183
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:45,118
customers are with like a landing page where

184
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,066
you just send users and you have a description of what you're

185
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:52,762
wanting to build, and then a waitlist

186
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:56,674
where they can sign up if they're interested to find out more when it

187
00:11:56,712 --> 00:12:01,166
launches. If you're really keen, you could even try preselling

188
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:04,546
your product. So saying buy it now

189
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:08,294
and when it's live, you will get full access, usually at

190
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:12,374
a discount. If people are willing to pay for the product before it even

191
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:15,110
exists, that is great validation.

192
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,906
You can also use surveys, whether it's free surveys to

193
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:22,970
your audience or paid ones out to anyone

194
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,458
who is willing to take them. There's loads of other ways you can

195
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:29,802
do market research, but most importantly is

196
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:33,498
probably just talking with your target customer. And that's

197
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:37,294
something I should have done a lot better. But I

198
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:40,986
thought my validation that I had done was enough. So I moved

199
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:44,978
on to the next step with more customer

200
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,674
validation than I normally do. It was time to start my

201
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:52,386
first coding montage. I spent a few days focusing on

202
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:56,086
the MVP, the minimum viable product. And I

203
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,974
prefer the name minimal viable product because you

204
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,538
still need to provide some value to your users.

205
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:07,494
Because if you're not valuable to their users, why would they use

206
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:11,322
it? Or why would they pay? So for me, that was

207
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:14,746
a chrome extension that adds a button just like this

208
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:18,106
to the LinkedIn payments section. Whenever you

209
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:21,200
click it, it reads the text from the post,

210
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,162
sends that to the API which generates the comment,

211
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:29,034
sends it back, and types it into the comment

212
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:32,850
section. One thing I didn't want to do is

213
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,570
be a completely automated solution.

214
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,682
I didn't want people clicking one button to comment on

215
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:44,066
the top ten posts because partly I

216
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:47,266
think that would get them blocked from LinkedIn because LinkedIn doesn't

217
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:50,614
like you even if you are manually doing it, going through and

218
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:55,030
sending loads and loads of comments in really, really quick succession.

219
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,050
But also I wanted the users to basically

220
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,086
add their personality to the payments.

221
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,914
If you're just sending a generic comment, it's probably

222
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:09,420
not going to grow as much as if you add your own

223
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,710
personality if you add your own perspective and experience to it.

224
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,354
So I did something a little bit cheeky. I added a fake typing

225
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:20,446
speed. So as the message is

226
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:24,318
being entered into the comment section, it types

227
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:28,462
it out one word at a time. This means that naturally

228
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:32,510
users will read the message as it's being typed,

229
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,386
and if you read through the whole message, you're more likely to go

230
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:40,040
ah, that doesn't quite sound right. I'll just tweak that a little bit.

231
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,958
So, with all in all, that took about three days to get the

232
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:47,574
chrome extension as well as all of the APIs working.

233
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:51,402
And before I went any further, I did something

234
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:54,666
that turned out to be super useful. Later on in the

235
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:58,406
month, I recorded a quick demo of the extension,

236
00:14:58,518 --> 00:15:02,990
generating a comment, and posted the video on LinkedIn.

237
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,054
That post now has over

238
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:10,830
17,000 views and 52 comments,

239
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,122
which was great exposure. Those comments were a mix of

240
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:18,690
supporting the idea and asking can they get access to it?

241
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,786
But also some absolute hatred for the

242
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:26,318
idea. As you can see, I was told to burn it

243
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:29,686
with fire, and I honestly can't remember the last time I

244
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,200
was told I need to repent for something.

245
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,630
But to capitalize on this notoriety, I quickly

246
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,282
created a landing page using just a website builder that

247
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:44,326
had a waitlist sign up form on. I continued

248
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:48,054
to post updates on LinkedIn and then carried

249
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:51,750
on building out features like a user sign up and login

250
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,190
usage monitoring, as well as making some tweaks to the chrome extension.

251
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,594
By the time I was ready to do the beta launch,

252
00:15:59,722 --> 00:16:03,486
I had 25 users on the waitlist who were wanting to

253
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:07,106
try out the product. So for the beta launch I

254
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:10,674
sent out the email to everyone on the waitlist telling them they could

255
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:13,860
install the chrome extension and try out the tool.

256
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,086
Straight away I started getting feedback and this is kind

257
00:16:18,108 --> 00:16:21,720
of really why I wanted to get people using it as soon as possible.

258
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,006
Some of the feedback was really good and some of

259
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,414
it was bugs, and having that interaction

260
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:33,018
with the users, being able to ask them more questions was super

261
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:37,370
valuable. So at this point I had kind of two tasks.

262
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,914
So handling the feedback, whether it was bugs or

263
00:16:42,032 --> 00:16:46,014
features that I thought yes, that's a great feature, I need that.

264
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:49,898
Before v one there were some other features which were like that's

265
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:53,678
a great feature, but I can't quite get it done before

266
00:16:53,844 --> 00:16:57,714
the MVP is launched. And some

267
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:01,106
ideas I thought didn't really match what I wanted to make the

268
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:04,466
product. As quite a few people did say, oh, can you

269
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:08,694
not just completely automate everything? Which kind of goes against what

270
00:17:08,732 --> 00:17:12,534
I was trying to achieve. I also wanted to get v

271
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:16,102
one ready and for that I needed two real

272
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:19,802
things, a proper website with a landing page,

273
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:23,562
sign up flow and account page. But also

274
00:17:23,616 --> 00:17:27,610
I wanted to have subscriptions so that people could actually pay

275
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,674
for the product for the website. I did consider trying

276
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:35,134
to build it from scratch, but then I remembered I've only got

277
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:39,214
30 days for this whole challenge and my CSS isn't the

278
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:42,962
hottest. So I could have spent the whole 30 days just building

279
00:17:43,096 --> 00:17:45,940
a fancy, attractive looking website.

280
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,798
Instead, I bought myself a react website template,

281
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:54,446
customized the CSS and added

282
00:17:54,478 --> 00:17:58,086
a bit of my own copy and published it. And this

283
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:01,666
is the website I ended up with. It won't win any awards

284
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:05,414
for design, but it clearly demonstrates what my product can

285
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,410
do and I don't think it looks awful.

286
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,140
So when you've got 30 days,

287
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,346
getting 80% of the way there with 20% of

288
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:20,438
the time and effort is a trade off that I'm definitely willing

289
00:18:20,454 --> 00:18:24,346
to make. And if in the future this ends up earning thousands

290
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:28,046
and thousands of dollars a month, I can then pay a

291
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:31,534
proper designer to come in and make a really, really well

292
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:35,280
styled website. But for now, this is more than good enough.

293
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,746
Now for payments on a project like this, I'd just always go to

294
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:43,234
stripe if you don't want to have the risk of handling your own

295
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:46,790
card details, and stripe is the quickest and easiest payment

296
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,230
provider to get set up with. I did have to build

297
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,402
a custom subscription integration using their webhooks

298
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:58,786
because of the way that my usage worked deploying

299
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:02,282
and securing the webhook APIs and the database that I needed

300
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:05,654
for this with a few minutes using serverless,

301
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:09,754
but then I had to just tweak all of the business logic around when

302
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:13,314
you get this event, make this change to the database

303
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:16,746
and that did take a couple of days. If you've

304
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:20,350
never done a stripe integration and you are wanting to do one,

305
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,226
I would start with a one off payment because they're much simpler to

306
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:27,810
do. You can also usually

307
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,474
find website builders that have either stripe or other

308
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:35,206
payment providers integrated into it so you never have to

309
00:19:35,228 --> 00:19:39,462
think about it. You just copy across your stripe API key and

310
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,686
all of the payments are handled for you. Upgrades downgrades everything

311
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:45,560
which is also really nice.

312
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,594
So 17 days after I started,

313
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:52,620
I was ready to launch my full app.

314
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,678
Over the last two weeks I'd continued to post progress updates

315
00:19:56,774 --> 00:20:01,370
on LinkedIn and had 69 people on the waitlist.

316
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,450
I sent out the launch email, posted about it on LinkedIn,

317
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,766
and kind of just waited. Over the next few

318
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:12,094
days I did continue to work on the app. I was fixing any

319
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:15,922
bugs that either beta testers or even some new free

320
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:19,554
users found, and also adding new

321
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:23,570
features like being able to change the tone of voice, which was

322
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,382
basically the first feature I wanted to add after v one

323
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:31,270
as it was direct feedback from the beta testers.

324
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,186
This allows you to basically change the tone

325
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:38,878
and the way that Chat GPT generates

326
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:42,570
the LinkedIn comment to give it a bit of variety.

327
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,586
I was also reaching out to LinkedIn creators who I

328
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:50,522
thought would be interested in the tool and might actually post about

329
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:54,670
it. Anything to get the tool in front of more users.

330
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,862
So after three days I had over 100 free

331
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:03,470
users, but still no one had upgraded to a paid membership.

332
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,894
I was beginning to think it was going to be another one of those ideas

333
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:10,594
that people say they love and will use for free all day,

334
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:13,970
but would never actually pay for. Then one night

335
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,030
I was lying in bed and I got a bit of a notification.

336
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,446
LinkedIn power tools, you've just received your first

337
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:25,634
payment. I was so excited. I was officially

338
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:30,006
a SaaS founder. With this new wave of excitement,

339
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:34,026
I spent the next two weeks writing LinkedIn posts, trying to

340
00:21:34,048 --> 00:21:38,170
reach out to more influencers and adding more features.

341
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,474
For me, one of the biggest features was being able to customize

342
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:46,030
the tone of voice on each and every comment,

343
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,230
even adding a question or a quote.

344
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,442
This was massive as I was finding the normal comments were

345
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:56,722
good, like far better than any other tool out there,

346
00:21:56,856 --> 00:22:00,978
but they didn't really continue the conversation very well

347
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:05,134
and sometimes they got a response, but often

348
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:09,042
they just didn't. And getting a response from the original

349
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:12,774
poster is a really good way of both building your

350
00:22:12,812 --> 00:22:16,882
relationship with that content creator.

351
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:21,158
But also a conversation shows value, and therefore

352
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:24,886
more of their users and their followers are likely

353
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:28,534
to check you out. Now, just adding

354
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:31,982
a single quote or a question to

355
00:22:32,036 --> 00:22:36,240
the comment seemed to massively increase the engagement that

356
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,286
those comments got, both in the number of likes, but also

357
00:22:40,468 --> 00:22:44,526
in the amount of replies from both the original poster,

358
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,890
but also other people inside their network.

359
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:52,542
Having conversations with creators increases

360
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:55,074
the chances that their followers will check you out,

361
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:58,390
and as you can see here on the left,

362
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,782
I ended up chatting with people who are on the Forbes 30 under

363
00:23:01,836 --> 00:23:04,440
30 list, which is really cool.

364
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,450
For the rest of the month, I focused on features and marketing,

365
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,934
but by the end of the 30 day challenge,

366
00:23:13,062 --> 00:23:16,490
the tool had continued to gain both free and paying

367
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,630
users, hitting a total of 300 free users,

368
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,254
six paying users, and $140 in

369
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:27,870
revenue. When you think that the tool had only been live

370
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,942
for actually 13 days, that's pretty good,

371
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:33,520
and I'd consider this challenge a massive success.

372
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,730
At the start of the talk, I did say that there were two things

373
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,620
that I think made this 30 days challenge a success,

374
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,330
and those are my unfair advantages.

375
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,926
The first one is that I am a serverless developer and

376
00:23:49,948 --> 00:23:53,734
I have built countless numbers of proof of concepts and

377
00:23:53,852 --> 00:23:57,426
MVP apps, both for myself, for the

378
00:23:57,468 --> 00:24:00,730
companies I've worked for, and also for clients.

379
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,442
This means that building things quickly, knowing how

380
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:08,570
to ruthlessly cut down to an MVP is

381
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,726
something I know how to do. The second is that

382
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:15,598
I started with 14,000 followers on LinkedIn from

383
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:19,120
just my general users of it over the last couple of years.

384
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,762
This means that every post I did actually got

385
00:24:23,816 --> 00:24:27,202
a couple of thousand views at minimum, which is really,

386
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:31,154
really good exposure. I also meant that

387
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:34,626
because they're on LinkedIn, they're more likely to want to

388
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:38,178
actually grow on LinkedIn. So I was accidentally targeting

389
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:42,086
and talking to my target audience, which was

390
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:45,574
a happy coincidence. But yeah, something that

391
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:48,874
definitely helped out a got now let's talk

392
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:52,186
about the one issue I found with limiting yourself to

393
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,658
a 30 days challenge, and that is

394
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,334
marketing. I started with 14,000 LinkedIn

395
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:03,566
followers and that was great for initial tractant and getting

396
00:25:03,748 --> 00:25:07,742
a handful of paying users, but the issue

397
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:11,454
is it's not going to scale. I think if I posted about this

398
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:14,762
tool every single day for six months, I'd continue

399
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:18,850
to get more users, but it would soon plateau

400
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,818
to really grow this product and

401
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:26,274
grow it into something where I could survive on the income,

402
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:30,498
I would need to find a more scalable marketing method,

403
00:25:30,674 --> 00:25:34,610
whether that's SEO, ads, influencer marketing

404
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,906
affiliates or any other kind of marketing

405
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:41,414
method. But trying to build and launch

406
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:45,162
this tool in 30 days meant I didn't really have

407
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,966
any time to try any of these. I tried a little bit of influencer

408
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:52,590
marketing and a couple of people reposted it or

409
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,334
did a video, but I didn't actually get into

410
00:25:56,372 --> 00:26:00,058
the point of paying for LinkedIn posts

411
00:26:00,154 --> 00:26:03,810
or anything that would actually scale as the product

412
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,014
did. And also for some of these, such as SEO

413
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:11,282
or search engine optimization, it can often

414
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,990
take months and months of work before

415
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,486
it starts paying back and making a return

416
00:26:18,588 --> 00:26:22,674
on that investment. But it can also skyrocket

417
00:26:22,802 --> 00:26:26,626
the access and the marketing

418
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:29,420
potential when it starts to kick in.

419
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,946
So what would I do differently next time? At the

420
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:38,362
start I did say that I'm going to do this four

421
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:41,802
times throughout the year, so I'm going to shake things

422
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:45,214
up a little bit. I do want to start by saying that I

423
00:26:45,252 --> 00:26:49,150
loved the restricted nature of the 30 day challenge. It meant I was like

424
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,634
hyper focused on just the things that

425
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:54,740
would provide immediate value.

426
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:00,146
So for the next couple of times throughout this

427
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:03,618
year, I'm thinking that I'm going to do one or two

428
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:06,886
brand new startup ideas. But then for

429
00:27:06,908 --> 00:27:10,450
one of the months, do a marketing month challenge,

430
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,082
spend 30 days trying to find scalable marketing

431
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:17,842
strategies. The ideally

432
00:27:17,906 --> 00:27:21,850
creating a process that I can use on

433
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,642
the other startups that I've done, but also in the future,

434
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:29,226
a pattern that I can follow that can help get

435
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:33,226
me past just my internal network

436
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:36,110
of marketing possibilities.

437
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,554
So yeah, also spending a whole month researching

438
00:27:40,602 --> 00:27:44,178
how to market startups is going

439
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:47,554
to be a massive learning experience. So I'm actually really

440
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:51,186
looking forward to that. Beyond that,

441
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:54,978
I definitely would make sure to speak to more customers as part of

442
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:59,014
the validation process, even just to learn about

443
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:02,614
how do they describe the pain that I'm solving so

444
00:28:02,652 --> 00:28:06,134
I can use that exact wording in the copy of my

445
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:09,834
emails or in my website. I'd also really

446
00:28:09,872 --> 00:28:13,850
like to do a business to business kind of business

447
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,146
model because the business to customer, which is

448
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:19,910
kind of what this was, is good built.

449
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,662
Charging $30 a month means that you

450
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:27,406
require huge numbers of users to actually become a

451
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:30,960
valuable business and something that I could live off.

452
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,140
Now, what can you learn from this? If you want to try this yourself,

453
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,550
you basically need to find your unfair advantages

454
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,866
and make the most of them. So you might

455
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,422
say that, oh, I don't use LinkedIn so I

456
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:50,582
have no advantage. But are you prolific on Reddit or

457
00:28:50,636 --> 00:28:54,514
on Twitter? If you are, then use those platforms

458
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:58,678
to share your tool, to get feedback from users,

459
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:02,570
and also just talk about your progress. Now,

460
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,506
have you also got experience in an industry? It could

461
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:10,446
be anything. It doesn't have to be a specific tech industry. It could

462
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:14,080
be nursing, it could be hospitality, it could be

463
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:18,734
painting. For all I know, you'll be able to have

464
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:22,270
an understanding of that sector, you'll know

465
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,890
where the ideas for solving really

466
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,282
painful problems are and

467
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:32,850
you'll know the language that you're going to use,

468
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,502
so you'll be able to communicate in a more cohesive

469
00:29:37,566 --> 00:29:41,010
way with them. And also you'll

470
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,974
probably know quite a lot of people in the industry. If you've got a couple

471
00:29:44,012 --> 00:29:47,302
of years of experience, this means you can got

472
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:51,562
to them as someone who already knows them and

473
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:54,746
this is a great way to get some validation. And you

474
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:58,140
never know, they could end up becoming your first couple of customers.

475
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:02,974
Now the second is that you really need

476
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:06,910
to focus on the minimum viable product and

477
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,710
I think you need to be really ruthless with this.

478
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,518
Cut away anything that isn't directly solving

479
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:17,442
the pain point of your customer. If things

480
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:20,270
go well and you end up getting a load of users,

481
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:24,594
then you can add cool features or extras later.

482
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:27,910
But if your problem doesn't actually solve the main

483
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,054
pain point really well, it's going to be hard to sell it.

484
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:35,814
Even if you're a developer. Maybe have a look

485
00:30:35,852 --> 00:30:39,366
at using a low code tool because this can save you a

486
00:30:39,388 --> 00:30:42,730
massive amount of time versus if you code everything

487
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,890
yourself. And this is something I might actually try in some of my future

488
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,382
30 day challenges because it's better to launch something

489
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:53,150
that is a little bit imperfect,

490
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,246
but to then start getting real user feedback as soon as

491
00:30:57,268 --> 00:31:01,214
possible than spend the whole time making

492
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:05,698
sure it's absolutely perfect, launching the idea and

493
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:09,714
finding out that it's a bit of a dud. So that's my

494
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:13,426
talk and I really hope you've enjoyed it and seeing how

495
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:17,574
really focusing on solving just one pain point you can

496
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:20,902
achieve more than spending like six months on an idea

497
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:24,934
you think might work. And how I've managed to do

498
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:28,570
this just using the serverless framework and

499
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,210
serverless architecture on AWS.

500
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,946
If you want to learn more about serverless and how

501
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:39,434
it can help you build systems insanely fast,

502
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:43,274
then maybe subscribe to the complete coding YouTube

503
00:31:43,322 --> 00:31:46,810
channel where we regularly put out videos on serverless,

504
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,366
as well as a load of serverless tutorials on how to

505
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:52,350
build specific features.

506
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,054
Now, if you're more interested in the exact architecture.

507
00:31:57,102 --> 00:32:00,546
I used to build this whole app. Then I've actually put a

508
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:05,482
PDF together where you can download and see the full architecture

509
00:32:05,646 --> 00:32:09,490
and actually see how simple it can be with serverless.

510
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,390
So that is serverlessmasterclass.com SAS

511
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,382
architecture. And finally, if you do

512
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:23,202
use LinkedIn and you're serious about growing an audience

513
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:27,206
there, then you can try out LinkedIn power tools and

514
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:30,682
