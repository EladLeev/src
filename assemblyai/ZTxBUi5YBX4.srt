1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,726
You. Hello and thank

2
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:32,280
you for joining me for accessibility testing 101.

3
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,880
Few little disclaimers just to get out of the way.

4
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,166
I will mention some regulations in the

5
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:43,462
course of this talk, but I am not a

6
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:47,010
lawyer and thus am not. I don't feel comfortable

7
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,038
with consulting too in depth th on

8
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:54,238
individual regulations and how they might apply to you,

9
00:00:54,324 --> 00:00:57,520
how you might meet them, that kind of thing.

10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:02,126
Additionally, any views or opinions that are expressed by

11
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:05,490
me are not representative of my company,

12
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,990
necessarily my employers. They are mine.

13
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,100
So just kind of a little cya there.

14
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,710
Today we're going to be learning about what is accessibility?

15
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,774
Why make things accessible? How do we decide what

16
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:23,974
is accessible? Building accessibility test

17
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:27,366
plans and tools and resources that can help you along the way as

18
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:30,490
you work to make things more accessible.

19
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,330
So, first off, what is accessibility?

20
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,466
Simply put, accessibility is how well can someone access

21
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:42,670
your content, services, facilities,

22
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,830
regardless of whether or not they have a disability?

23
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,246
And then with disability we're going to

24
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:55,262
focus on it being a mismatch

25
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:59,150
between the person and their environment, whereby the environment

26
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:02,958
creates a barrier to them accessing

27
00:02:03,134 --> 00:02:06,870
information, services, facilities, things of that nature,

28
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,694
and then assistive technology. Or you might also hear it referred to as

29
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:14,722
adaptive technology. This is just any kind of software

30
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:18,934
hardware that someone may use to help balance

31
00:02:18,982 --> 00:02:22,506
out that mismatch a little bit and allow them to access

32
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:27,562
services and information more

33
00:02:27,616 --> 00:02:31,146
easily. And then you may also see the numerom a

34
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:35,246
one one y, which a numero im is just when you swap out some

35
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,040
of the better in a word for numbers,

36
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,822
kind of like nerd speak in a way, and it's usually

37
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:45,586
the end result is representative of what the original word was or what it

38
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:49,918
meant. In this case, a eleven y means accessibility,

39
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,966
and it stands for the fact that the word accessibility starts

40
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:57,666
with the letter a, ends with the letter y, and has eleven

41
00:02:57,698 --> 00:03:01,398
characters in between. And you'll often see it used, maybe kind

42
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:05,378
of an ode to sort of the nerdiness of numero nyMs,

43
00:03:05,474 --> 00:03:08,940
you'll often see it used for digital accessibility in particular.

44
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,018
Now the following are just some different categories that you

45
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,114
can use to kind of help you begin to think about how

46
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:22,814
disabilities may impact someone's ability to access services,

47
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:26,990
how you might be creating barriers unintentionally.

48
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,646
These are not necessarily all inclusive. You'll sometimes see

49
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:35,026
people divide them up a little bit differently. Here I've got them

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,690
divided up based on types, time and visibility.

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,058
For types I have hearing. So like someone having

52
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,790
being hard of hearing, or being in an environment where maybe

53
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,390
auditory signals just aren't going to be

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,022
effective. We've got

55
00:03:54,076 --> 00:03:57,234
vision, so it can be, of course, like sight loss

56
00:03:57,282 --> 00:04:01,014
or being in an environment where visual stimuli

57
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:05,290
or signals are not going to be effective at communication

58
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,866
mobility. So someone could have be carrying a child in

59
00:04:09,888 --> 00:04:13,678
their arms and thereby have limited mobility for the

60
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:17,502
time period that they're carrying the kid around. It could also be someone

61
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:20,714
who has a limb amputation,

62
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:24,690
a broken arm, someone who has

63
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,658
sprained their ankle, anything of like that nature could

64
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,890
technically be a mobility disability.

65
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,402
And then comprehension. This could be things from ADHD,

66
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:37,750
dyscalcula,

67
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,760
dyslexia. It could also be things like

68
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,174
if someone is in a state of panic, because think about it,

69
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:50,586
if you're panicking, you are not thinking as clearly as you

70
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:54,202
are when you're not panicking. This can be someone who has

71
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:55,980
ADHD, like myself.

72
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,710
Any of those kinds of things could technically count as comprehension.

73
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,822
For time, we're looking at how

74
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:11,502
long is the disability impacting, how frequently is it

75
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:15,070
impacting the person? So it could be temporary.

76
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,762
If I break my arm, ideally like

77
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:22,994
six weeks, maybe a couple of months, my arm is going to be

78
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:29,090
hopefully healed up and back to normal, for the most part situational.

79
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,614
This would be something where, like, for instance, the parent carrying around

80
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:36,662
the child, they're only impacted while they're holding the child,

81
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:40,858
and then once they set the child down, things are good.

82
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:45,082
It could be someone who has an anxiety disorder. There may only be certain

83
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:48,890
situations where their anxiety tends to peak,

84
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,214
certain things that cause them to get

85
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:57,166
worked up. Permanent would be things like

86
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:59,630
someone who has a limb amputation,

87
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,118
that the limb is gone, unless medical science

88
00:06:05,294 --> 00:06:07,860
figures out a way to resolve that.

89
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,970
And so that's kind of a permanent disability.

90
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,274
Or if someone loses their sight because of a permanent

91
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:20,022
injury or birth defect, something like that, that's not

92
00:06:20,076 --> 00:06:23,270
going to go away, most likely,

93
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,694
and then visibility visible versus invisible.

94
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:32,550
So just whether or not the disability is visually apparent

95
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,010
to outside perception,

96
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,910
for instance, someone who is blind,

97
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,778
it may not necessarily be visible to outsiders

98
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:50,186
that they are blind, or to what extent they are blind.

99
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:53,470
For instance, in some areas,

100
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,026
depending on the level of sight loss, someone may still be able

101
00:06:57,048 --> 00:07:01,218
to drive a car. So it may not be readily apparent that

102
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:03,330
that person is blind.

103
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,080
Someone who has a mental health condition, you're not necessarily going to

104
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,318
realize it visually that there's something going on,

105
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:17,334
versus if you see someone in a wheelchair or

106
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:21,082
someone with the iconic white

107
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:24,870
cane or a service dog, it's a little bit more visually apparent

108
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,980
that, oh, there's a disability at play.

109
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,554
May not be 100% sure what all is

110
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:36,046
at play because there can be a combination. And that kind of is a

111
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:39,966
thing across all of these is you can see a lot of overlap. You can

112
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:43,726
see things that kind of vary

113
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:47,442
back and forth between whether or not they're visible, invisible, or what

114
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:50,782
types of disabilities, in terms of like hearing, vision, mobility,

115
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,090
comprehension, are impacted.

116
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,978
And also especially because a lot of disabilities,

117
00:07:57,154 --> 00:08:01,174
they'll have comorbid or other conditions that

118
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:04,646
tend to happen with them. So, for instance, someone who

119
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:08,234
has adhd or autism, it's very common for them to have

120
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:11,130
other sensory impacting conditions.

121
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,534
Someone who has certain musculoskeletal

122
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,022
conditions, they may be more prone to having other

123
00:08:20,096 --> 00:08:24,090
issues at play. So there's kind of a mesh

124
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,280
going on there.

125
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,030
So why make things accessible?

126
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,114
Well, simply put, by creating an experience where

127
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:38,034
people can all access the same information and services, we help

128
00:08:38,072 --> 00:08:41,906
people. We help people make more

129
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:44,770
informed choices for themselves and their communities.

130
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,286
We help people feel more welcome, which can lead to

131
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:52,520
better employee and customer retention. In a business world,

132
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,834
we encourage diversity in our communities and workplaces because

133
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:01,626
we're making people feel more welcome. And this can in

134
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:05,482
turn lead to us being more innovative, because we have these

135
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,570
more diverse lived experiences.

136
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,574
So more chance that someone may have an experience

137
00:09:12,692 --> 00:09:16,446
that helps them think of an idea to a

138
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:20,222
solution, to a problem that maybe no one else would have

139
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:23,986
had the forethought to think of. And then there's also

140
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:27,780
the fact that you won't miss out on the market because

141
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,930
that little added monetary incentive,

142
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,530
fortunately, sometimes it's kind of necessary.

143
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,798
I've actually got an article here that is linked a hidden market,

144
00:09:41,884 --> 00:09:45,154
the purchasing power of working aged adults

145
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:49,080
with disabilities, by the American Institutes for Research.

146
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,298
It is very informative article. I really highly recommend

147
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:57,882
checking it out. They actually state in that

148
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:02,174
article that through research, it was estimated that

149
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:06,202
the total disposable income for US adults with disabilities

150
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:09,310
is about 490,000,000,000,

151
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,886
which is comparable to other significant market segments,

152
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:17,700
such as different racial segments and

153
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,146
other age segments. You can read more in the

154
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:25,880
article if you'd like. And it's also important to remember that

155
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,766
according to the CDC, it's about one

156
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:35,458
in four people that have a disability, and you tend

157
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:39,110
to see that number be fairly consistent around the globe.

158
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,034
So that can be potentially a huge number of people

159
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:47,162
that if you're not making things accessible, you could be missing out

160
00:10:47,296 --> 00:10:49,900
on having those people as customers, because, I mean,

161
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,626
if you're not making things accessible, they're not going to feel like you

162
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:56,686
really want them as your customer. They're not going to have as good of an

163
00:10:56,708 --> 00:11:00,350
experience. They're not going to want to be your customer.

164
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,034
They're not going to want to be an employee if you're not making them

165
00:11:04,072 --> 00:11:08,050
feel welcome and allowing them to participate.

166
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,238
So how do we decide what is accessible?

167
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:15,638
There's kind of a mixed thing at play here.

168
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:19,174
It's a mixture of your own personal experience, because as

169
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,914
you build different experiences, different facilities,

170
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:27,302
sites, web applications, anything of that nature, you're going

171
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:30,874
to be able to see for

172
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:34,982
yourself kind of what impacts different experiences

173
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:38,362
have. You'll be able to get user feedback which is going to

174
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:42,430
feed into that experience and help you better

175
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,774
identify different issues that

176
00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:47,950
might cause barriers.

177
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,914
That user feedback in particular is very

178
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:56,478
important because going back to the other slide,

179
00:11:56,574 --> 00:12:00,846
the whole having a diverse array

180
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:04,466
of customers and employees, when you

181
00:12:04,488 --> 00:12:07,880
have that greater diversity of employees and customers,

182
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,054
you're going to get more different lived experiences, because even

183
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:15,190
amongst people who have the same disability,

184
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,906
it may present different, they may have different

185
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:24,326
symptoms at play, they may have different comorbid conditions.

186
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:27,574
It just may impact them a little bit differently.

187
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:31,066
And so getting that wide array of user

188
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:35,406
feedback is really going to help with building your experience

189
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:39,582
and making it easier for you into the future to design

190
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:43,458
a more accessible experience. Additionally, we have guidelines that

191
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:46,900
we can use. Most notably is the different

192
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,662
worldwide web consortium, or w, three c guidelines

193
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:54,290
made by their web accessibility initiative.

194
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,386
The most known one, of course, amongst these is the Wikag

195
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:02,550
or the web content accessibility guidelines,

196
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,506
which is currently in version 2.1. And version 2.1

197
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:11,642
is what the majority of regulations around

198
00:13:11,696 --> 00:13:15,226
the world are based off of. However, it is

199
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:18,582
important to note that when it comes to different guidelines

200
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:22,890
like wakag, these are starting points.

201
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,366
Even in the Wakag guidelines, if you read the sort

202
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:30,634
of the introduction portion of it, they very specifically

203
00:13:30,682 --> 00:13:34,594
state that it's not going to capture every

204
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:38,514
experience. Again, just because people can have such

205
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:42,306
different presentations of different disabilities can

206
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:46,374
be impacted differently by different visual, auditory and

207
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:49,190
whatnot elements.

208
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,014
And so it's very good to like, you want to try to be

209
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:56,950
compliant with some of these guidelines, but don't be too strict

210
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,514
because otherwise you may miss out on opportunities to make things more

211
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:05,430
accessible. Some other w three C guidelines

212
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,690
are the ATAG, which is the authoring tool. Accessibility guidelines

213
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,640
basically deals with tools that you use to create content.

214
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,282
So like Visual studio,

215
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:22,094
Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, things that you're using to

216
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:25,826
create digital content. There's the user agent

217
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:29,266
accessibility guidelines, or UAG. And this

218
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:33,570
is basically browsers, media players,

219
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,926
things that you would use to ingest or view

220
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:41,874
digital content. There's the accessible

221
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,550
rich Internet applications, or aria.

222
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,326
This is a technical specification used to help make

223
00:14:48,428 --> 00:14:52,470
dynamic or interactive content in digital scenarios

224
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,394
more accessible. And then I've got another

225
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:59,562
one that I've got thrown in here that is not by the w three C,

226
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:04,250
it's actually by the US

227
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,014
government, a different portion of the US government whose name has

228
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:12,326
just eluded me. But it is the accessible electronic documents

229
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:16,174
community of practice. And this is basically just a set of guidelines

230
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:20,638
to help with creating more accessible documents,

231
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,022
presentations, spreadsheets,

232
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:27,170
pdfs, digital documents of that nature.

233
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,686
So very highly recommend checking that out. They've got some great

234
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:35,874
test plans and stuff that you can use to help with checking

235
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:39,434
whether or not those kinds of things are accessible. And then

236
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:43,274
of course there's regulations. That's the part that a lot of

237
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:47,018
companies are incredibly worried about, because obviously

238
00:15:47,184 --> 00:15:50,146
you break a regulation, you open yourself up to lawsuits,

239
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:52,510
fines, things of that nature.

240
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,390
I will say that whole idea of getting sued for

241
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,182
breaking accessibility regulations, yes,

242
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:04,946
there are the people who do the drive by lawsuits, but the

243
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:09,426
majority of the time when you see lawsuits for accessibility issues,

244
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:13,122
it's because people have reached out, they've tried

245
00:16:13,176 --> 00:16:16,294
to get things fixed and not

246
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:20,166
been successful, and so then they resort to a lawsuit to

247
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,680
try to force the company's hands.

248
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,286
So just keep that in mind. I think

249
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:31,738
that's important to keep in mind that you

250
00:16:31,744 --> 00:16:35,850
can encourage your users to reach out and you can

251
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,706
work with them to make a more accessible experience before you

252
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:43,354
ever have to worry about getting sued. If you are actually listening

253
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:47,642
to user feedback. Some common one regulations

254
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:53,230
now I primarily deal with like north american regulations

255
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,010
just because of my location.

256
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,130
So the Americans with Disabilities act, or ADA

257
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,980
section 508 of the Rehabilitation act of 1973,

258
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,586
the Accessibility for Ontarians act, or AODA,

259
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,550
which is a Canada regulation.

260
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,534
And then if you want to learn more, the w three C under their web

261
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:19,734
accessibility initiative actually has a page entitled

262
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:23,482
Web Accessibility laws and policies. It's not always

263
00:17:23,536 --> 00:17:26,874
guaranteed to be up to date, and it's not going to be all

264
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,606
inclusive, but it will give you a good

265
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:34,480
starting point for looking up different regulations based on particular

266
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,606
parts of the world. So how do we go

267
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:42,478
about really building our test plans, coming up with

268
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:45,746
how we're going to create accessible content?

269
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:49,874
Well, the big thing is shift left.

270
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:54,030
You've probably heard this before. If you've done any kind of software development,

271
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,640
it can really be applied though to any kind of

272
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,942
effort that you're making in a company, whether it be

273
00:18:02,076 --> 00:18:05,910
designing and deciding upon how to create a new facility,

274
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,786
creating documents, a marketing strategy, anything like

275
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:13,446
that. The shift left ideology really can benefit

276
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:16,934
you with accessibility, and it's just the idea of including

277
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:20,702
accessibility as early in the process, as early

278
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:25,134
in the discussions, the designing, all of that as possible.

279
00:18:25,332 --> 00:18:28,794
So that way you're more likely to catch

280
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:32,158
potential issues early on when it's a

281
00:18:32,164 --> 00:18:35,474
little bit easier to make sure that you do

282
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:38,866
things correct and in

283
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:42,466
the best way possible, versus waiting until the

284
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:46,450
very end when things are about to go to production or already are

285
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,718
just out in the wild and testing it

286
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:53,334
and being like, oh wait, it's broken now

287
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:56,822
we got to go back and potentially redo a whole lot that we

288
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:02,266
didn't have to do. And that's also like the

289
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:05,978
whole waiting until the last minute. That's kind of why there's the

290
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:09,130
whole myth that accessibility is expensive.

291
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,114
Usually it's not accessibility itself that's expensive.

292
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:16,880
It's the fact that people wait until the very end,

293
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,790
find out that they've made a huge blunder,

294
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,540
and then they're having to go back and redo everything.

295
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,220
And you'll see that if you're designing anything

296
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,326
that can be a problem. If you don't bother

297
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:37,166
to have users test something until it's already out in production

298
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:40,754
and you're getting complaints, it's obviously going to be a lot more expensive

299
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:44,454
to fix any issues than it would have been had there

300
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:47,706
been testing and discussions earlier on to catch those

301
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,700
potential issues.

302
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,666
Having a good, healthy balance of manual testing and

303
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:57,990
automated, I know people want to go automated,

304
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,142
so there's less work, hopefully, and less

305
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:05,678
repetitive tasks, less human error, that kind of

306
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:09,950
thing. But with accessibility, you really want to have a

307
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,246
nice, healthy balance because automated testing,

308
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:17,202
I think the last number I saw was

309
00:20:17,256 --> 00:20:21,090
something in the 30% to 37%

310
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,206
range somewhere in there of accessibility issues that

311
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:29,094
could be captured by automated testing. And also

312
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:32,902
because if you just depend on automated testing, you can have a site

313
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:37,518
that's absolutely inaccessible, that completely passes automated tests

314
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:41,420
with flying colors if people do things

315
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,946
the wrong way. Right? If that

316
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:49,450
makes sense, I've actually got an

317
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,322
example that you can see. I've got a GitHub repo that I'll

318
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:57,534
have shared at the end of this presentation, and I actually have a good

319
00:20:57,732 --> 00:21:01,182
site example and a bad site example, and they both look

320
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:04,706
identical. And if you run the automated tests on

321
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:08,820
them both, they are absolutely just,

322
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,950
they pass with flying colors, even though one is atrocious

323
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,826
when it comes to navigating it with any kind of assistive

324
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:21,126
technology or just in general compared to the

325
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:24,598
other. So again, having a

326
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:28,700
healthy balance of manual and automated, then there's this.

327
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,290
You may hear the term nothing without us used in the accessibility community

328
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,854
a lot. And this is the idea of include

329
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:41,054
people who actually are living with disabilities as

330
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:45,150
early as possible. Kind of combine that with the shift left to

331
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,480
include those people in the discussion early on.

332
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,218
And this is also where that whole diverse customer

333
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:56,674
and employee base can come in handy. Because again,

334
00:21:56,872 --> 00:22:00,206
you can have three or four people that have the same quote

335
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:03,714
unquote disability who present very

336
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:06,934
differently. So you want to try to include a good

337
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:11,314
array, like a good diversity of individuals

338
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:14,706
with lived disability experience, so you're more likely to catch

339
00:22:14,738 --> 00:22:18,220
those issues, maybe get that feedback early on.

340
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,274
Now, you also will often hear, when you're looking up

341
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:28,170
accessibility testing, the emphasis on screen reader and keyboard accessible

342
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,290
just because something is fully screen reader or keyboard accessible

343
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,120
isn't necessarily going to make it perfect.

344
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,550
But typically if something can be consistently

345
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,166
and well navigated with a screen reader

346
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:48,866
or a keyboard, and I also emphasize the

347
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:52,130
idea of using multiple screen readers,

348
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,622
we'll talk more about that in one of the next bullet points.

349
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:59,254
But if you can get things consistently and well

350
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:02,962
navigated with keyboard and screen reader, it's going to typically

351
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:06,342
be more likely that other

352
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:10,138
assistive technologies will provide

353
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:12,620
a consistent experience.

354
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,262
You don't want to put 100% focus on screen reader and keyboard

355
00:23:18,326 --> 00:23:21,886
only, but just know that it does help

356
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:26,046
quite a lot. But then again,

357
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:29,774
going back to the nothing without us, that's also why it's important to then bring

358
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:33,250
in other people with different disabilities who

359
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,726
might catch issues that the screen reader and keyboard only users

360
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,170
wouldn't have caught.

361
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,814
Remember that a lot of accessibility plans are typically

362
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,530
based around WiCAg,

363
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,134
because that's just what a lot of the regulations are based off of, and because

364
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:55,014
the WiccaG tends to be broken down in such a way that it's a little

365
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:58,326
easier to build individual test plans based on some

366
00:23:58,348 --> 00:24:01,722
of the guidelines. But it's important

367
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:05,194
to remember, again, that those guidelines are not going

368
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:09,642
to be all inclusive. They're not going to catch all the different accessibility errors that

369
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:13,214
may be present. And that's why it then becomes important to

370
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,910
make sure that you're getting that user feedback.

371
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,010
And also with the Wik guidelines,

372
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,886
another thing that sometimes people get a little caught up in is as

373
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:29,230
of 2.1, there is three different levels

374
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,674
of conformance. This may change with later versions, at least how it's split up.

375
00:24:32,712 --> 00:24:36,066
There'll probably still be conformance levels that just might be labeled

376
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:40,306
a little different, but right now they are AAA.

377
00:24:40,418 --> 00:24:43,990
And AAA A is basically like

378
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,866
the accessibility things that you really shouldn't even

379
00:24:47,888 --> 00:24:51,386
be having to try. If you're using good practices, you should be

380
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,620
hitting those things just no problem.

381
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,866
Which also means that if you are breaking some

382
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:03,294
of those, you really need to fix that stuff and maybe fix

383
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:07,214
some of your practices. Typically what

384
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:11,406
a lot of regulations are based around. And that's kind of like the

385
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:12,974
good standard to try to hit.

386
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,366
IsAA is

387
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:19,534
like special use cases or nice if you can.

388
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,920
It can make things a little bit better,

389
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,946
but you don't have to be 100% aaa compliant.

390
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:30,982
And in fact within the guidelines, it even kind of says

391
00:25:31,036 --> 00:25:34,130
that if you try to be 100% aaa compliant,

392
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,718
you may cause accessibility engineer other areas. So you've got

393
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:40,918
to be kind of careful about how you apply some of the AAA

394
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:44,586
requirements. And then there could also be instances where some of the

395
00:25:44,608 --> 00:25:48,486
guidelines just don't apply. For instance, if you don't

396
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:52,620
have pre recorded audio video content,

397
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:57,022
obviously those guidelines are most likely not going to apply

398
00:25:57,076 --> 00:26:00,174
to you. So that's just something to kind of keep in mind.

399
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:03,662
And again, making sure that you're being flexible build

400
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:07,826
upon. You might use the Wik guidelines as a starting point, but then

401
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:11,842
you want to build upon that to make more

402
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:15,362
robust test plans. Another important thing,

403
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:18,886
and this is kind of what I was kind of hinting at with the

404
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:22,274
screen reader point, but you want to customize

405
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:26,246
your test methods for different environments and you want to try to test across as

406
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:29,754
many environments as possible. So like with screen

407
00:26:29,792 --> 00:26:33,462
readers, there is typically jaws

408
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:36,330
and NVDA and narrator for Windows.

409
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,922
If you can test across all three of those screen readers,

410
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,520
that is awesome.

411
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:48,826
Mac and iOS have voiceover,

412
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:52,898
Android has talkback. You want to

413
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:57,074
try to test across those different screen readers and environments when possible,

414
00:26:57,192 --> 00:27:02,542
because just the way that content can be interpreted

415
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:06,642
by those different screen readers can vary slightly. There may be slight differences

416
00:27:06,706 --> 00:27:10,422
in what Aria, for instance, are compatible with

417
00:27:10,476 --> 00:27:14,534
those screen readers, or how those screen readers interpret that

418
00:27:14,572 --> 00:27:18,234
content, or even how different browsers interpret that content

419
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:22,106
and operating systems. So it's really good to try to

420
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:24,810
test across all those platforms.

421
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,354
Testing across different browsers. Now,

422
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:32,702
there may be some exceptions. So, like for instance, if you just

423
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:36,480
have a native app on a phone

424
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,526
and it's only available on Android for a

425
00:27:40,548 --> 00:27:44,206
particular business reason, obviously at that point you're

426
00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:47,746
only testing in that one environment. If you have

427
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:51,950
an embedded system, something like on a smart refrigerator,

428
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,474
well, obviously you're just testing it on that refrigerator. You're not testing it

429
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:58,942
on your browser, your mobile device,

430
00:27:59,006 --> 00:28:02,118
that kind of thing. There's that flexibility there. You want to

431
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:05,606
make sure to try to hit all the different environments that you can so you

432
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:09,370
catch those little side issues. Unless you have

433
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,210
a specific use case where it's limited to a particular environment.

434
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,130
You can see a lot of example test plans.

435
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,010
Two that I've got listed here are VGAR, which is the visa global accessibility

436
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,898
requirements. This is just visas publicly

437
00:28:25,994 --> 00:28:29,614
available accessibility guidelines. They've got some little

438
00:28:29,652 --> 00:28:33,166
example test plans, tools and other resources that can be

439
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:37,086
helpful. There's also the section 508 ICT

440
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:39,140
testing baseline for web.

441
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,986
This is as it says, it's section 508 testing. You'll see

442
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:47,090
it used for the Department of Homeland Security trusted tester

443
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,190
certification, as well as just general section 508

444
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,838
compliance testing. There's also a

445
00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:58,742
few other examples that I'll mention later on, but those are just two

446
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:02,646
for now to get you started. So now onto tools

447
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:06,506
and resources. These are basically tools that for the

448
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:09,962
most part may be already available to you and you may just not realize it

449
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,614
or are freely available. I'm going to mostly focus on

450
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:17,550
things that are free here because those are of course usually the easiest ones

451
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,482
too. If you're trying to pitch to your employer

452
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:24,546
to get them to let you have access to things,

453
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:27,106
those are going to be the easiest ones to get them to let you have

454
00:29:27,128 --> 00:29:31,010
access to. So first off, things that are built into

455
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,622
your browser here

456
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:38,930
I have the Chrome devtools

457
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,866
that are available within Chrome and the Chromium based edge

458
00:29:42,898 --> 00:29:46,930
browser, as well as the lighthouse

459
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,970
testing options that are within the devtools.

460
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,762
The first set of devtools on the left, those are actually the

461
00:29:56,816 --> 00:30:00,070
rendering options that are available within the Chrome devtools.

462
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,774
And those are accessed by, when you open up the devtools, there's a little

463
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:07,578
ellipses that's labeled with, I think, customized devtools.

464
00:30:07,674 --> 00:30:11,134
If you hover over it and when you go into that, then there's a more

465
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:14,638
tools option and then you can access these rendering tools

466
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:17,970
and they just give you some nice little extra features that might help

467
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,502
with making it a little easier to identify

468
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:25,006
flashing content, simulating what it might be

469
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:27,778
like if someone is using custom CSS,

470
00:30:27,874 --> 00:30:31,446
because that's what some people will do. And it's kind of

471
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:34,950
like the effect that some of the assistive

472
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:39,622
browser extensions, what some of them do is they're injecting

473
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:43,626
custom CSS into a page to cause an

474
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:47,130
effect that makes something more easy for someone to interpret.

475
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:51,214
It also gives you color filters that will help to kind of

476
00:30:51,332 --> 00:30:54,878
simulate what it is like if someone has

477
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:56,910
certain types of colorblindness.

478
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,350
So it has a lot of nice nifty tools that might be helpful.

479
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,598
Lighthouse is available within the

480
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:12,110
Chrome devtools, and it's just a set of automated tests

481
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,150
for accessibility, SEO, things of that nature.

482
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,334
Now, this does fall into that whole be careful. Just because

483
00:31:21,372 --> 00:31:24,534
you get 100% on the lighthouse doesn't necessarily mean

484
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:28,714
that your application is 100% accessible. Next, we have

485
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:31,740
some that are actually built into your operating system.

486
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,134
So on the left here I have the accessibility options for Microsoft

487
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:39,660
Windows. I think this was specifically Windows ten.

488
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:43,806
And then on the right is the accessibility shortcuts that are available

489
00:31:43,908 --> 00:31:47,310
within macOS. And there's kind of some similar

490
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,920
ones that are available in iOS as well.

491
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:54,542
Now, a lot of these are meant to help make things

492
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:58,322
more accessible to users with disabilities. But of course,

493
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:02,014
what better way to know if your content is going to be accessible

494
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:05,862
to someone with a disability than to actually use the tools that that person

495
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:09,698
would be using. So, for instance, there's different color filters,

496
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:13,442
there's the built in screen readers. So for windows, that's narrator,

497
00:32:13,586 --> 00:32:15,990
iOS, Mac, it's voiceover.

498
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,302
There's different zooming options, text scaling, things of that nature,

499
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:24,794
even color filters that you can use to sort of get

500
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,090
an idea for how accessible your content

501
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,950
may be to users who are using those very tools.

502
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,160
Now, there's also some different desktop applications you can get.

503
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,922
The first one I'm going to show here is the color contrast analyzer,

504
00:32:40,986 --> 00:32:44,482
also referred to as CCA a lot of times by

505
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:47,854
the Picello group, which is usually shown as TPGI.

506
00:32:47,902 --> 00:32:52,690
Now, if you just search for CCA by TPGI,

507
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,518
it'll actually come up as this should be like one of

508
00:32:56,524 --> 00:33:00,022
the first results that comes up. And it's a free desktop application for

509
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:03,382
Windows and Mac that just lets you see

510
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:07,222
if you have a particular foreground color

511
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:11,062
with a particular background color, how much contrast

512
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:15,020
is there between those colors, and is it enough to pass

513
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,882
different Wicca guidelines? And it actually

514
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:23,262
lists three of the WiCCa guidelines that it's comparing against.

515
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:27,262
And it'll tell you whether or not it would pass based on the

516
00:33:27,316 --> 00:33:31,230
regular size text for that guideline or the

517
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,074
large text for that guideline. And it gives you a nice little

518
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:38,994
description for each of those guidelines on what counts as

519
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:42,722
regular text or large text and what the

520
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:46,594
actual contrast ratio is that you have to meet. So very

521
00:33:46,632 --> 00:33:50,006
nice. And it's simple to use, so it's a

522
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,638
good option. There are other browser extensions too that operate sort

523
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:57,254
of similarly. This is just one of the common ones that you might see

524
00:33:57,292 --> 00:34:00,982
used, and it's free. Next I have Microsoft

525
00:34:01,046 --> 00:34:04,086
accessibility insights. Microsoft accessibility Insights

526
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:07,418
is available as a browser extension for

527
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:11,614
Chrome based browsers and also as a desktop application

528
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:15,694
for Windows. The Windows desktop application

529
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:19,710
has a there's an accessibility insights for Windows

530
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,774
and an accessibility insights for Android that's

531
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:28,322
both downloadable to Windows OSS and the

532
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:32,530
for Android one is meant to help with. If you're developing Android applications

533
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,350
versus the for Windows one, you can just test anything on Windows.

534
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,566
And then additionally there are pipeline options that

535
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:45,990
you can actually use to test when someone

536
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,106
submits, like a pr request for instance, or if someone goes to build

537
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:53,626
the application, it may run some checks during the

538
00:34:53,648 --> 00:34:57,258
build process. So something that could be very helpful to a

539
00:34:57,264 --> 00:35:01,306
lot of people. The nice thing about the browser

540
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:05,118
extension is that it does give you fast pass

541
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:08,606
options which are like your automated tests. And then it gives

542
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:11,994
you an assessment option which combines the automated

543
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:15,602
tests with a manual test plan which you could

544
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,234
theoretically use as a starting point for building your own

545
00:35:19,272 --> 00:35:22,530
custom test plans. And then it also

546
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,638
adds a few different little ad hoc tools which are just different

547
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:28,838
little tools that you can use for testing color,

548
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:32,982
contrast, tab order, and a few other

549
00:35:33,116 --> 00:35:36,582
different things as they add on to the application. And it's also

550
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:39,946
open source. So if you see something that you notice is an

551
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:43,578
issue, you could actually go in and recommend a

552
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:47,322
fix for it yourself. I've actually submitted a pr

553
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:49,820
to it. I was really happy about that. It was cool.

554
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,320
Next im showing on the screen here is the wave tool.

555
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,814
The wave tool is accessible through a browser extension and

556
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:04,362
through a website interface. The website

557
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:07,998
interface actually gives you the option to paste in the URL,

558
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:12,162
or I think it gives you the option to actually paste in

559
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:15,414
the source code and it'll spit out a

560
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:18,918
report about different accessibility issues.

561
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:22,646
If you use the URL, it'll actually display the

562
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:26,562
page with an overlay and it'll highlight different potential

563
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:29,818
issues on the page or things that you're doing right. So it's kind of

564
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:34,026
nice to be able to see some of the good and the bad and

565
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:37,980
the maybe a problem things on the page.

566
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,122
It also gives you the option to right click on the page and it'll say

567
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:43,440
wave this page.

568
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,274
And then on the right here I have the browser

569
00:36:49,322 --> 00:36:52,110
extension for Axe devtools.

570
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,034
Axe dev tools is made by DQ and there's a

571
00:36:58,072 --> 00:37:00,100
free option and a paid option.

572
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,622
The free option will let you do a general scan.

573
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:08,390
I think the paid option adds in like some automated color

574
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,390
contrast checking and some best practice sort of testing.

575
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,950
Similar to accessibility insights,

576
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,898
it does also provide some manual guided testing options

577
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:25,594
as well. In fact, accessibility insights is

578
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,078
based off of the same Axe core API that Axe

579
00:37:29,094 --> 00:37:32,946
devtools is based off of. It's just different interfaces

580
00:37:33,078 --> 00:37:36,414
and a little bit different added features for each

581
00:37:36,452 --> 00:37:39,440
one. So you can kind of pick and choose which one you like best.

582
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,610
One thing I will note too with a lot of the automated tests

583
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,210
is say you have a page where you have different

584
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,174
modals and such that open up, or frames

585
00:37:52,222 --> 00:37:55,278
that only get added if you click on certain buttons.

586
00:37:55,454 --> 00:37:58,882
When these things run their tests, they're only running the test on

587
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:01,160
what's on the page in that moment.

588
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,414
So they're not going to be testing like those different little modals that can pop

589
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:10,220
up. They're not going to test if the page is different sizes and different

590
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:16,038
just proportions that could cause things to reflow differently

591
00:38:16,134 --> 00:38:19,100
and for other things to move about on the page.

592
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,294
So that's another reason you want to really keep

593
00:38:23,492 --> 00:38:27,950
in mind that automated testing is not conclusive.

594
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,160
Next we have the W three C markup validation service.

595
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,670
This is going to identify some accessibility

596
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,220
issues and also a lot of parsing issues.

597
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,914
So it can help you to note whether or not you've got maybe some

598
00:38:44,952 --> 00:38:48,566
HTML best practices that you're not following as well as you should.

599
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:53,186
Maybe you're misusing some aria using bad values,

600
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:56,854
and it'll just kind of give you a report. As you can see

601
00:38:56,892 --> 00:39:00,454
here, you can either upload a file, just give it the URL

602
00:39:00,502 --> 00:39:04,026
for the page, or actually paste in the

603
00:39:04,048 --> 00:39:08,010
source code, and it'll just give you a nice little report that you can actually

604
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,258
export into different file types. So if you

605
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:14,126
wanted to share the results with someone else, it would be very easy to do

606
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:17,786
that. This does have the same limitation though, that it's

607
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:21,102
only testing the page as it would be when you first open

608
00:39:21,156 --> 00:39:24,546
it, and it's not necessarily going to catch issues that might

609
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:28,290
only appear when certain modals open up and things of that nature.

610
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:33,310
Finally, we also have accessibility bookmarklets.

611
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,614
Bookmarklets are like little snippets of JavaScript

612
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,138
that you can drag up onto the bookmark bar that's

613
00:39:41,154 --> 00:39:44,822
usually in most browsers. You may have to turn on the bookmark bar

614
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:48,706
if it's not on by default, but you drag these to the bookmark

615
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:52,380
bar and then let's say you have a web page up and you want to

616
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,202
see what kinds of heading structure you have on the page

617
00:39:56,256 --> 00:39:59,906
that's recognized you might have a headings bookmarklet.

618
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:04,410
There actually is one under this accessibility bookmarklets

619
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:08,286
option here and it

620
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:11,754
would actually highlight all the accessibility bookmarklets.

621
00:40:11,882 --> 00:40:15,966
There's basically bookmarks like for bookmarklets

622
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,090
for checking for just about anything, aria, form,

623
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,226
structure, landmarks, text spacing and

624
00:40:24,248 --> 00:40:27,220
then one of the more robust ones is the Andy tool.

625
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:32,662
I might try to actually show that one here real quick

626
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:36,246
when I get done here, depending on how much longer it

627
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:37,990
takes me to get through all these slides.

628
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,194
Also, there's a lot of books out there that can help. Three that I've got

629
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:47,210
here are inclusive design patterns by Hayden Pickering,

630
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:52,282
form design patterns by Adam Silver, and inclusive

631
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:56,478
components by Hayden Pickering. Inclusive components in particular

632
00:40:56,564 --> 00:40:59,950
is really nice because Hayden actually has

633
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,386
a website version of the book that's completely free and

634
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:08,370
it shows a lot of great examples for how to make certain components

635
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,914
in an inclusive way. It is important though, to remember with anything like

636
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:16,098
this that just because someone

637
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:19,266
suggests hey, here's one way you can make a drop

638
00:41:19,298 --> 00:41:23,170
down menu, here's one way you can make this particular form component.

639
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,838
Doesn't mean that that's the only way, but this just gives you

640
00:41:26,844 --> 00:41:29,974
a good starting point. Additionally,

641
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:33,670
there's some other resources I have listed here. Links for NVDA,

642
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,500
which is a free open source screen reader that a lot of

643
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,642
individuals with sight loss use. There's accessibility

644
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:43,630
insights that I mentioned earlier,

645
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,778
information about narrator, voiceover,

646
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:50,560
Talkback, the Microsoft Accessibility page,

647
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,938
Microsoft's accessibility fundamentals course, a link to

648
00:41:54,964 --> 00:41:58,994
Andy and the accessibility page on my own personal site which

649
00:41:59,032 --> 00:42:02,802
if you go to the accessibility page on my corgi dev.com site,

650
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:06,630
I do actually have every resource that is listed

651
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,166
in this presentation is also present there,

652
00:42:10,268 --> 00:42:13,910
as well as links to my GitHub where you can view

653
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,400
these specific slides if you'd like.

654
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,314
And in fact right here I'm just going to show on my little thank

655
00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:26,122
you slide my corgi dev.com

656
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:30,090
site as well as my GitHub site which is

657
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,982
GitHub Comcorgydeva

658
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:39,690
eleven materials.

659
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:45,282
If you go to that, it will actually have

660
00:42:45,336 --> 00:42:48,642
this presentation under presentations and then

661
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:52,130
2023 presentations. And with that

662
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,054
we're just going to switch over to another screen here so

663
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:59,686
that I can actually show you some

664
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:03,094
of the tools and concepts that I discussed earlier in this

665
00:43:03,132 --> 00:43:05,970
presentation in action.

666
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,498
So first off here you'll see I've got my

667
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:12,060
good site, bad site.

668
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,162
Neither one is really a good site, it's just good for this

669
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:20,814
example, but visually they

670
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:23,630
have the same general layout.

671
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,146
We've got the header logo, some navigation links

672
00:43:29,178 --> 00:43:33,010
and then some headers, paragraphs and images that

673
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,930
constitute the main content of the page. And some

674
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,146
footer links and a little copyright down here

675
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:45,206
for the footer. Now if

676
00:43:45,228 --> 00:43:47,830
I actually inspect these pages,

677
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:54,994
the big thing that you'll notice here is that there's

678
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:59,100
the head, the body, but then inside the body it's basically

679
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,220
all divs. For the most part.

680
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,406
All the text is inside of either paragraph tags

681
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:09,986
or spans. There's no header elements. All the images

682
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:13,070
have alt attributes that are null,

683
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,422
which would indicate to assistive technology that they are just

684
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:20,766
decorative and not informative, which is not the

685
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:21,680
case here.

686
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,962
There are no nav elements to

687
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:32,514
help describe what

688
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:34,770
areas are navigation links.

689
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:39,590
There is again no headers.

690
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,710
The footer is just a div with a list

691
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,400
and then a div that has some text in it.

692
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:51,820
Versus if I go over to my good site example

693
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:56,026
and I inspect that one, you'll notice that

694
00:44:56,048 --> 00:44:59,594
inside the body I actually have a header that headers the

695
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:03,194
image. It has an alt attribute. All the images on here have alt

696
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,650
attributes that actually have good values

697
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,674
because that's the thing. I mean you can have an alt attribute,

698
00:45:09,802 --> 00:45:13,074
but if it doesn't really convey what the information is

699
00:45:13,112 --> 00:45:16,610
intended to be gained from that image by the user,

700
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,060
it's not really good. Alt attribute text.

701
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:26,462
I have navs now since there's a nav in the header

702
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:30,246
and in the footer, you'll notice I actually have an AriA label on

703
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:34,134
each one to help differentiate them. This is because some

704
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:38,242
assistive technologies will actually list off the landmark elements

705
00:45:38,386 --> 00:45:42,018
for the user. And so if you just had two navs,

706
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:45,142
they're just going to show up as two Navs. But if you add that Aria

707
00:45:45,206 --> 00:45:48,426
label, it'll actually label them for the user. So they

708
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:52,110
say nav and then like main navigation nav,

709
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:56,126
social media links or something like that. That way the user just

710
00:45:56,148 --> 00:46:00,000
knows that there are different types of links, maybe in each one,

711
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:03,486
which can indicate to someone what they may

712
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:06,754
expect to find there. Because if you think about it, when we visually look through

713
00:46:06,792 --> 00:46:10,146
a website, we're tending to look at how is the

714
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:13,294
content grouped together, where is it positioned

715
00:46:13,342 --> 00:46:17,118
visually on the page. And that's giving us an idea of oh well,

716
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:20,902
I can probably expect to find links for this thing I'm looking for.

717
00:46:20,956 --> 00:46:24,486
If I go down to the footer versus the header, we can

718
00:46:24,508 --> 00:46:28,230
look at how headings differentiate in view

719
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,042
compared to regular text to help us pick them out really quickly

720
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:35,834
and skim through and maybe identify what

721
00:46:36,032 --> 00:46:39,306
text has what purpose or what section is

722
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:42,702
most likely to contain the information that we need. And so using

723
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:46,254
all this proper semantic HTML, you're essentially doing that

724
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:50,026
same thing for someone using assistive technology. You're allowing

725
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:53,666
them to sit there and go through and just view a list

726
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:57,394
of headings and skim through to the one that they

727
00:46:57,432 --> 00:47:01,198
actually need. You're allowing them to immediately

728
00:47:01,374 --> 00:47:05,026
go to the footer and look there for the

729
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:08,920
content that maybe they're looking for and they expect will most likely be there.

730
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,806
In my main, I do have some divs because divs are

731
00:47:14,828 --> 00:47:18,242
okay to use if you're just wanting to apply particular formatting

732
00:47:18,306 --> 00:47:21,546
or something to a section, but it's still good to

733
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:25,114
make sure to use the semantic like I've got sections here,

734
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:28,714
each section has an aria labeled by so we know what that

735
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:32,574
section is actually for. Got my

736
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:36,542
headers. My headers are all proper h one h two h

737
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:40,154
three s. I've got paragraph text because that's

738
00:47:40,202 --> 00:47:43,934
perfectly fine to have nothing against having paragraph

739
00:47:43,982 --> 00:47:47,762
text. Again, I've got

740
00:47:47,816 --> 00:47:51,650
all my different links and whatnot

741
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:55,010
laid out here with proper semantic HTML,

742
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:00,774
and that's going to help with someone that's got assistive technology that they're using.

743
00:48:00,972 --> 00:48:04,550
Now, if I go to axe devtools,

744
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:08,620
as one would expect, once I close the like

745
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,474
pro info, you'll notice it

746
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:15,820
has zero issues. It's good to go.

747
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:22,106
However, if I go to the bad one and

748
00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:25,902
I also run that, it's also going to come up with zero.

749
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,958
That's because automated tests are only going to be able to do so much.

750
00:48:29,044 --> 00:48:32,302
So like for instance, it's not going to know whether or not

751
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:36,254
these images need to be null alt attributes indicating

752
00:48:36,302 --> 00:48:39,506
that they're decorative, or if they need to actually have an

753
00:48:39,528 --> 00:48:42,610
alt attribute with a value. They're not going to know

754
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,038
if whatever value I give that alt attribute is

755
00:48:46,204 --> 00:48:49,506
meaningful and conveying the purpose of the image, or if it's

756
00:48:49,538 --> 00:48:52,840
just random generated lore mipsum text.

757
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,586
It's kind of like how if you do AI generated alt attributes,

758
00:48:59,778 --> 00:49:03,386
it's not always going to be the accurate meaning of

759
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:07,146
the image. So it's just something to kind of keep in mind. You don't want

760
00:49:07,168 --> 00:49:11,226
to completely depend on automated testing. You want to make sure

761
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,320
to have a little bit of that manual testing in there as well.

762
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,270
Okay, now im going to actually go back over here to my corgi dev

763
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:23,700
accessibility page. Actually, I'm going to open this up

764
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:29,198
in Chrome first, just because for some reason Lighthouse

765
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:32,866
has been giving me trouble in edge the last week or

766
00:49:32,888 --> 00:49:36,006
two. Not sure what's going on there? So to

767
00:49:36,028 --> 00:49:40,082
show you Lighthouse, which again, as I mentioned earlier,

768
00:49:40,226 --> 00:49:43,430
Lighthouse is the automated testing tool

769
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,714
that is available within Chromium based browsers

770
00:49:47,762 --> 00:49:51,530
like Google Chrome or the new Microsoft soft edge,

771
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:55,750
you open devtools and you just select Lighthouse.

772
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,940
It gives you a few different options here that you can pick from,

773
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,850
including like you can actually do mobile versus desktop,

774
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,754
which can help with that whole thing I mentioned earlier where automated

775
00:50:07,802 --> 00:50:11,070
testing isn't going to necessarily capture all the issues

776
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,914
because it's not going to necessarily capture modals and stuff that might

777
00:50:15,032 --> 00:50:17,762
come up on your page that could have accessibility issues.

778
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:21,586
It's just going to test what is visible on the page in

779
00:50:21,608 --> 00:50:25,860
that moment. Now im going to analyze page load here.

780
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,826
Now the one good thing about it is since it does this page load,

781
00:50:29,938 --> 00:50:33,366
if you have tooltips and stuff that modals that just pop up

782
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:36,518
when you initially load the page in,

783
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:39,414
it will be able to test those, but it's just not going to test other

784
00:50:39,452 --> 00:50:43,226
things that might open later. As you can see, it'll give me this nice

785
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,114
little rate layout. If I had issues that it picked up,

786
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:50,750
it would display them here for me to be able to see them.

787
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,254
And it also gives you options to export them,

788
00:50:54,372 --> 00:50:58,126
open them in a different viewer, different options that allow you

789
00:50:58,148 --> 00:50:59,200
to share them.

790
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:05,426
Since we already have devtools open here,

791
00:51:05,528 --> 00:51:08,994
if I go up to this top, ellipses labeled customize and

792
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:13,010
control devtools by its tooltip and I click that and select

793
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,914
more tools and rendering, I get this

794
00:51:16,952 --> 00:51:20,406
little option window down here at the bottom and

795
00:51:20,428 --> 00:51:24,246
you'll notice it has things like paint flashing. There's no flashing content on

796
00:51:24,268 --> 00:51:27,960
this page right now. So that's not going to really do me anything right now.

797
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,660
But it does give me some different emulation options,

798
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,642
including this nice little one down here that

799
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:39,100
gives me an idea of what different kinds of

800
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:43,282
vision. I don't really like the word deficiencies

801
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:47,354
impairments, but like vision differences, how that might impact

802
00:51:47,402 --> 00:51:50,638
how someone views your page. It is important to

803
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:53,698
note that with any of these, it's not

804
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:57,780
going to be as accurate as having someone that actually has these conditions since

805
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:01,902
how these present amongst different people can vary

806
00:52:01,966 --> 00:52:05,710
from person to person. But you

807
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,398
can get an idea, it can give you an idea if there might be some

808
00:52:09,484 --> 00:52:15,206
apparent contrast issues that could be problematic and

809
00:52:15,228 --> 00:52:17,910
then go back over here to edge.

810
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:21,290
And we also have accessibility insights.

811
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,214
Accessibility insights. The nice thing with it is, again, like I mentioned earlier,

812
00:52:26,262 --> 00:52:28,140
you have some of the automated options,

813
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,662
but on top of the automated options you also

814
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:37,834
have this assessment, which it does have the automated checks,

815
00:52:37,882 --> 00:52:42,154
but then it also gives you these guided manual tests.

816
00:52:42,282 --> 00:52:45,434
Now these are not going to be like all inclusive of different

817
00:52:45,492 --> 00:52:48,866
platforms that you could be testing your content on, but they give you a

818
00:52:48,888 --> 00:52:52,834
good starting point. And it can be helpful for developers who

819
00:52:52,872 --> 00:52:56,614
may not have as much accessibility testing experience

820
00:52:56,812 --> 00:53:00,246
just to kind of be able to have something that they can go through and

821
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:03,990
they can get an idea of where they might need to make improvements.

822
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,614
Additionally, we also have the ad hoc tools

823
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:14,010
which you'll see. It just gives me options to highlight,

824
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:18,422
do color contrast checks, tab stops,

825
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,774
landmarks. I actually kind of like the way it

826
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:25,374
displays landmarks better than some things

827
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:29,146
that need review, the accessible names

828
00:53:29,178 --> 00:53:30,000
of things,

829
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:35,250
and even some of the automated checks.

830
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:42,382
Now the other thing that I mentioned during the presentation was bookmarklets.

831
00:53:42,446 --> 00:53:45,762
And I'm going to start with Andy. Now, I don't think I mentioned this earlier,

832
00:53:45,826 --> 00:53:49,586
but Andy was actually developed by the Social Security Administration

833
00:53:49,698 --> 00:53:53,586
and it's used for section 508 compliance testing,

834
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:57,346
including the Department of Homeland securities trusted tester

835
00:53:57,378 --> 00:54:01,026
certification. And it just will pick up on different

836
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:04,474
elements that it picks up on the page, which can be helpful too, because like

837
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:07,990
for instance, there's a table and a frames module

838
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,594
that can pop up with Andy. And so if you have

839
00:54:11,632 --> 00:54:15,214
a table on the page but the Andy table tool isn't popping up,

840
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:19,034
that could indicate that you've got an issue with how you wrote your table

841
00:54:19,162 --> 00:54:22,910
and it's not going to be interpreted correctly by assistive technologies.

842
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,834
Let me see. I don't know for sure. Okay, so now with

843
00:54:28,872 --> 00:54:31,986
some bookmarklets, one thing that's important to know is some of them you can just

844
00:54:32,008 --> 00:54:35,478
click the bookmarklet again and it'll close it. Other ones you actually have

845
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:39,126
to refresh the page. So I've also

846
00:54:39,148 --> 00:54:42,470
got bookmarklets here for headings.

847
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:48,502
I've got one for text spacing because some people that have like dyslexia

848
00:54:48,566 --> 00:54:52,138
or low vision may have stylings that

849
00:54:52,144 --> 00:54:55,466
they use to increase text spacing. So it's important to see that

850
00:54:55,568 --> 00:54:59,420
your content is going to adjust to that.

851
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,054
There's a little code sniffer one here that'll give me some little

852
00:55:05,252 --> 00:55:08,414
tidbits of information about issues that might be on my

853
00:55:08,452 --> 00:55:11,946
page lists.

854
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,714
You can find all kinds of these

855
