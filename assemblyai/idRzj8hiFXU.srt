00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,802
Hello everybody. Become to this talk. This treasure related

2
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:31,110
to the intelligent business agility. So before to

3
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,950
think about intelligent, we needed to understand why this can be

4
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,750
very, very important for your organization,

5
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,846
for your company. And the

6
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:45,110
idea here is that you need to find a way

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,694
to align, to create a bridge between the

8
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:54,158
strategy and the execution. Those is very important because sometimes

9
00:00:54,244 --> 00:00:58,538
in the real world, it's very, very hard to transform

10
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:02,394
your ideas, your approach

11
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:06,446
to the market in a way that can be really executed

12
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:11,710
by your organization. And this can create a very gap,

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,294
a very problems between what you think

14
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:19,640
to do and what you really achieve during your

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,078
activities and in the way in which you can support

16
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:26,774
your customers. And for that, it's very

17
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:30,314
important to have in your mind that your

18
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:34,246
organization must follow, must achieve

19
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:38,170
what we typically call business

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,174
agility. What is business agility? Business agility is an

21
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:46,826
ability of an organization to fast adapt

22
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:50,970
itself to the market. And those ability

23
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,138
related to those ability to change in a very fast way,

24
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:58,578
but in a very cost effective ways.

25
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,562
Those transformation of your environment shows also you need

26
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:07,070
to have a great focus, a great capability

27
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,726
to produce a very, very good product, a very

28
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:15,126
quality product. And in case you must focus

29
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:18,550
your attention to the technical agility. So business agility

30
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,666
is built on

31
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:26,342
process agility, enterprise agility and technical

32
00:02:26,406 --> 00:02:29,930
agility. This is a great point.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,502
Sometimes in the lecturer tools you can find

34
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:37,290
that business agility is the same than enterprise agility

35
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,198
or process agility is not true. Business agility is

36
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:45,250
those full vision of agility of your company in relation to the market,

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,994
in operations, to your customers. But you needed to be focused to

38
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:52,546
make a great attention, to also have all

39
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:56,520
of these three pillars, agility themselves.

40
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,386
In that way you can try to create the right mix,

41
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:04,822
the right balance between them and between all

42
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:09,142
the activities, all the initiatives that you can approach to achieve

43
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:13,258
those final results. So enterprise agility means that

44
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:16,970
you can have your organization focused on

45
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,830
what really is important. And you can do that

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,046
having for example, grid leader inside your company,

47
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:28,362
thinking about to going beyond budgeting.

48
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:32,586
So thinking about how I can founding my solutions,

49
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:37,918
my budget teams without have a so bureaucracy

50
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:41,234
plan. So bureaucracy approach to the budgeting. Something like okay,

51
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:44,754
we needed to create the budget for the whole year, but we

52
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,582
have no way to change it. That's not correct.

53
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:51,826
We needed to have a flexible way to adapt

54
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:55,746
the using of our founding to create our budgeting

55
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:59,434
in relation what really happens during the day by day

56
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,898
activities and supporting what really create value

57
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:08,220
for our customers and our company.

58
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,990
We needed to be agile, we need to be lean, it's important that

59
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,526
because actually agile lean can be the

60
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:20,506
most powerful tool that you can use to achieve

61
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:23,906
the enterprise agility in relation to business agility. And sure you must

62
00:04:23,928 --> 00:04:27,826
think about value stream before projects because value stream is

63
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:31,890
something that it's very very continuously

64
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,578
live in your company. It's not something that starts

65
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:39,958
and ends in a specific time, but it's something that

66
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:43,858
continuously is attention inside your company to create values,

67
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:47,990
continuous value for your customer. And the second point, technical agility.

68
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,774
There is no way to achieve the business agility without technical

69
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:57,114
agility. This means that you need to be excellent in

70
00:04:57,312 --> 00:05:00,926
what you do and the way what you do something. So you

71
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:04,298
can use different framework,

72
00:05:04,394 --> 00:05:07,486
different practices, but it's very important to

73
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,258
create your own approach, your own mix

74
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:15,402
of all of these to really, really achieve technical

75
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:19,394
agit. And also you must be excellent in technology.

76
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:23,058
Select the last solutions and so on.

77
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:27,302
That's very, very important. And list but not last process

78
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:31,240
agility. You can identify how support

79
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,686
in a practical way this transformation using

80
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:39,142
frameworks inspire yourself to toolkit

81
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:42,810
create a mix also in the way that you really,

82
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,186
really apply those concept of

83
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,530
a culture, innovative culture, learning culture in a

84
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,310
very pragmatic way. For example, you can

85
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,446
decide to use scrum or kanban or something like this.

86
00:05:56,548 --> 00:06:00,640
It's not so important to

87
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,378
be the best in the world to adapt, for example scrum. But it's very important

88
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:09,266
to create a tailoring of all of that in

89
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:13,074
the way that can really support your

90
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:16,694
goals like company. And here

91
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:19,954
the idea is that you needed to innovate,

92
00:06:20,002 --> 00:06:24,150
you needed to transform your company, you needed to start to think

93
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,140
in a different way, how you can

94
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,458
guide your organization and you can lead your organization to

95
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:39,066
achieve these results. And we

96
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:42,238
need to change, you need to change. And to do that,

97
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:45,966
one of one model that can support you

98
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:50,654
is related to the eight steps process for

99
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:53,678
leading change suggested by Dr. Cotters.

100
00:06:53,774 --> 00:06:57,666
These are a set of eight steps, but the

101
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:00,974
most important for starting the flame

102
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:04,926
for start a new transformation is the creation

103
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:09,206
of a sense of urgency. When you can create, when there

104
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:13,286
is a sense of urgency, every time that you

105
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,078
are sure that you view that something that you are doing from a

106
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:21,298
lot of years is not helpful,

107
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,258
it's not still helpful for you. So you need to think something different,

108
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:27,100
a different way to work.

109
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,206
And sometimes when all the things are okay,

110
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:38,094
is very difficult to

111
00:07:38,132 --> 00:07:41,754
have a real commitment in a transformation

112
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:45,940
because those people doesn't understand why change if all is okay,

113
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,002
when different products,

114
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:54,098
different actions doesn't go well,

115
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:58,158
you can have more support for those I'm

116
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:01,862
not suggesting to create a problem problems inside your company,

117
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:06,838
but I suggest you to have a very good

118
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:10,842
attention to what happens in your company. Identify when can be a good

119
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:14,970
time for start and when is the moment to really

120
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,890
reinvolve the company, the organization to something

121
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,570
different. Because change have a cost and you need to motivate

122
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,934
that. And you can measure to

123
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,118
use a disciplinary job approach to change. What it

124
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:34,274
means with that is an idea that there

125
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:37,986
is no right model for everyone. There is not the

126
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:41,602
right framework for everyone. But you must think something like

127
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,770
creating options inside your organization.

128
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,686
And you can use those until

129
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:52,006
metaphor for that. For example, you can imagine that in

130
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:56,374
your company, every one of you is an ant.

131
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:59,830
And every one of you and everyone of those ant,

132
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,674
every ant transport an option transport something

133
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,450
that can be helpful to improve your antil.

134
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,758
If something is not correct, if something is wrong,

135
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:15,662
no problem. Because you have your colleague and yourself can select

136
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:19,360
a different option to have a very

137
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,830
real improvement. Not one improvement, but a real

138
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,378
improvement. In this way you can be fast in change. You can be sure that

139
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:33,074
one local failure is not so big, but you can

140
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:36,946
learn from it. And you can select in a fast way a different

141
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:41,746
approach coming from a very, very restrict

142
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:45,234
number of selection, because you are learned from your failure

143
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:49,434
before, from your experiment. So small experiments are

144
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:53,334
better. Yes, that's true. And you can imagine that you have a pragmatic

145
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:57,340
approach for that. Define a starting model, defining an idea,

146
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,246
identify the first candidate option to

147
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,074
adopt, presenting an MVC,

148
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,920
a minimum viable change that you can use for

149
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,046
experiment something different with a metrics that's very

150
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,058
important that you can use to measure it.

151
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:19,262
So after you apply this MVC, after you experiments this MVP,

152
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:22,786
you can measure the outcomes and identify if the new

153
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:26,962
idea, the new option is in line with your expectation.

154
00:10:27,106 --> 00:10:31,174
And if yes, you can accelerate the adoption of

155
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:34,230
those new option, these new practices and so on.

156
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,946
If not, you can go back identify new

157
00:10:37,968 --> 00:10:41,626
MVC or if needed, you can change the plan because you

158
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:45,594
are totally out of the scope that you

159
00:10:45,632 --> 00:10:49,906
before image to follow for improve your organization.

160
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:54,430
And you can best

161
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:59,338
all of that with the using of the artificial intelligence.

162
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:03,554
I yes, that's true. Because if we go back to this

163
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:07,106
slide, one of

164
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,950
the steps is related to measure outcomes.

165
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,394
So that means that you have data and you needed

166
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:17,414
to analyze this data. And you know that people are not so

167
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:20,742
good in analyzing a very, very big amount

168
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:24,694
of data. So in this case, you can use I to

169
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:28,220
improve your capability to

170
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,074
analyze this data and reduce the number of

171
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:35,930
options that you must consider

172
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,500
for your new improvement. The heart

173
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,338
is to succeeding fast, succeed faster.

174
00:11:43,434 --> 00:11:46,686
That means that using machine turning,

175
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:49,738
using big data, using ie,

176
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,926
you can receive suggestion from models,

177
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,734
algorithms and so on that can be useful for be faster,

178
00:11:56,782 --> 00:12:00,242
identify the right option to achieve the

179
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:03,714
better results in aless time. And that's very,

180
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:09,414
very interesting. So for that I

181
00:12:09,532 --> 00:12:12,466
created the idea of the intelligent business agility.

182
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:16,694
And this IBA does mean that you can use all

183
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:20,262
of the data that you can collect inside your company to

184
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:23,594
support an organization achieve its

185
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:27,174
business agility. And the right definition

186
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:30,506
here is that IBA represents the ability

187
00:12:30,538 --> 00:12:34,874
of organization to develop an adaptive corporate

188
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:38,314
culture supported by intelligent

189
00:12:38,362 --> 00:12:42,126
agents that are able to support people to enable more

190
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:45,650
fast decision. And that's very important because it's not something that

191
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,938
remove the needs of people, but support

192
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,210
the people in their decisions.

193
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,302
So how IBA supported in the presenting

194
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:01,894
GDT, collecting information coming

195
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:05,878
from customer, so we can have more data from customer, coming from example,

196
00:13:05,964 --> 00:13:09,306
I don't know, from social networks and so

197
00:13:09,328 --> 00:13:13,402
on to support, how to

198
00:13:13,456 --> 00:13:17,002
support in presenting how customer are

199
00:13:17,136 --> 00:13:20,526
looking for us and what is

200
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:25,114
our brand reputation in their minds.

201
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:29,034
So we can use this data for supporting innovation

202
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:32,554
because we can select

203
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:36,834
new ideas, new products in

204
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:40,226
relation to the data that we collect from a lot

205
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:43,842
of sources and in the commitment. Why this? Because in those way

206
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:47,718
we have a total sharing of information,

207
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:51,730
data, different point of view collected

208
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,410
in different analysis,

209
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,354
used for different analysis that can support different people inside the

210
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:02,810
company. We can use also

211
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,194
ie for supporting the technical agility, because we can use

212
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:10,586
that to align your technology choice to

213
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:13,966
the real needs needed solution. So we can really understand

214
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:18,254
measure in some way if we are in the right path to

215
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:21,742
use in an efficient way our technology and if

216
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:26,094
this technology is the right one to achieve the right goals

217
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:30,274
and create the right products. And also we can use for

218
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:33,874
example, data for

219
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:37,414
maximize the capability to use better way

220
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:41,634
our technical skills and improve

221
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:45,542
step by step, all of that. And we can use

222
00:14:45,596 --> 00:14:48,618
also a to support process agility. Sure,

223
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,882
because we can use it for monitor what happens inside

224
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,980
the different teams, how their

225
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,860
mature level improvement, for example,

226
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,906
across different iteration, across different sprints

227
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:09,022
and so on. We can use that for accelerate their

228
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:13,154
growing. For example, they can measure, for example an

229
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:16,766
IBoT can identify

230
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:20,514
view the different trends for I don't know how time

231
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,094
you need to create to have a daily inside your team and suggest

232
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:27,926
you few standard approaches to use better the

233
00:15:27,948 --> 00:15:31,682
time and to reduce the wasted

234
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:35,174
time inside it. And it's very important to have

235
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:40,138
accuracy so you can have a really important

236
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:43,980
way to really identify step by step

237
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,806
what is your real possibility to achieve the IDL

238
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,966
goal. And I suggest you to

239
00:15:52,148 --> 00:15:56,286
few practices that can improve the

240
00:15:56,308 --> 00:16:00,750
opportunity to improve yourself in the right direction.

241
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,330
Two principles are at the basis of IBA,

242
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,094
empowering and inclusive and data driven.

243
00:16:10,222 --> 00:16:13,442
Empowering inclusive means that you must

244
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:17,222
create a learning culture and a culture based

245
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:21,158
on sharing and collaboration. That's very important because you needed to share

246
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:25,030
and you needed to also

247
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,954
use the data, not just for

248
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:29,980
the personal,

249
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,246
just for the personal goal, but in relation to holistic

250
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,718
goals, company goals. And it's very important that also

251
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:45,966
you use in the right way

252
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:49,534
with the respect those data, this data with the respect of the other

253
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:53,602
people and for protect their

254
00:16:53,656 --> 00:16:56,690
privacy, their identity and so on.

255
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,098
Also you must be sure that

256
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:04,258
you trust this data to transform them. Not just

257
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:08,654
something like an additional tools,

258
00:17:08,702 --> 00:17:12,710
but really base your decision on them and

259
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,566
on the other side, data driven. You must be sure that all the

260
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:19,882
company people can access in a very fast way, in a very simple

261
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:23,946
way, all the data across the organization. And you need sure

262
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:27,546
to have rigorous data practices to be sure that the

263
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:31,102
data that you are using during your analysis and for support

264
00:17:31,236 --> 00:17:34,640
ABI are good data and not the bad data.

265
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,754
So what can be four Edel

266
00:17:39,882 --> 00:17:45,700
steps to go

267
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,078
ahead with your implementational journey in relation to ABA.

268
00:17:50,174 --> 00:17:53,710
So you can start but those foundation from the foundation

269
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,158
point. At this point you are asking yourself

270
00:17:57,324 --> 00:18:00,774
if you have those good

271
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:05,090
data and if your expectation

272
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,826
are satisfied or not, what is

273
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:12,458
your level of digitalization and what

274
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:16,150
are your capabilities, analytic capabilities

275
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,546
to use this data to create real information,

276
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:23,422
not data but information for supporting decision inside your company.

277
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:26,766
The second step is the approaching step

278
00:18:26,948 --> 00:18:30,186
in you can start image

279
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:34,418
what can be the promises that can be

280
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:38,322
outside from the using of this approach. So you can

281
00:18:38,376 --> 00:18:42,030
starting create the right platform, the right digitalization

282
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,900
inside your organization to use those information.

283
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,926
You will start looking for how you can

284
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:53,814
increase and optimize the process. And sure you

285
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:57,570
must be also aware in how you can

286
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,874
distribute in some way. You can give

287
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:06,266
the right information to the right people. Those next step is

288
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:10,222
aspirational. So in this case you will experiments and apply

289
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:13,838
to really a BA at all level

290
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:18,590
of your organization. And in this case you can identify

291
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:22,582
how you can use that to improve your lifecycle,

292
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:26,706
your management and so on and building and how

293
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:30,740
to build the foundation for that architecture. At the

294
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,006
fourth stage of your journey you

295
00:19:36,028 --> 00:19:39,750
can imagine that you will be mature and you have

296
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,094
really created a continuous learning organization with

297
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:46,530
a high digitalization

298
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,778
and a real, real trust in

299
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:54,906
the BI, IBA and for this you

300
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:57,994
will trust the information. You are sure that your system will

301
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:01,902
give you a real important

302
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:05,498
information to support your organization, to improve

303
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:08,718
itself. And for this you will have

304
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:12,654
two main guidelines to implement your journey. The first

305
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:15,946
is those stair guideline.

306
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:18,898
So security and privacy, this is very important.

307
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:22,930
You must be sure that you will have security

308
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,446
and privacy about your data.

309
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,970
Transparency, accountability,

310
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,994
inclusiveness and reliability and safety.

311
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:34,662
So security and privacy, how I said before

312
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:39,338
is a very, very important point because you need to be sure that data

313
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,562
are managed in the right way and you must

314
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:47,366
be sure that you protect your data from external

315
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:50,710
attacks, from misuse of them. And that's very, very important

316
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,400
because if you grant this, you can be sure that

317
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,166
your people will trust it. And we collect a

318
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:02,802
good amount of data and the right data to support you in

319
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:06,126
the business. Intelligent business,

320
00:21:06,238 --> 00:21:08,770
agility, AI and those transparency.

321
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,366
This is another important pillar because you must be sure that

322
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:20,742
you are very transparent in

323
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:24,760
using your data, in how you can

324
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,820
share the key elements of that. And you must train your people to

325
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,190
use the suggested action

326
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,770
coming from bots and other type of ie

327
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,122
just for support them. But the final decision will be theirs.

328
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:49,854
Not coming, not automatic decision coming from these

329
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,026
tools, accountability. So these people must be in

330
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:56,340
charge for maintaining the

331
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,754
responsibility over ever decisions that we

332
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:04,738
will take based on this data, on this information.

333
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:07,830
So it's not remove managers,

334
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:11,650
it's not remove team lead, it's not remove developers

335
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,030
here. The point is that you need to use that to

336
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,430
give to these rules, those people new tools

337
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,810
on which they can take

338
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,618
their decisions in a better way, in a more informed way,

339
00:22:28,784 --> 00:22:31,630
in a more specific way. That's the point,

340
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,520
inclusiveness. So you need to remember that

341
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:43,746
it's very important to have

342
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:47,362
a respect for all the sources and use

343
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,926
all the information in a holistic way. So it's

344
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:54,638
not a way to divide people, separate people, but it's

345
00:22:54,654 --> 00:22:58,550
a way to clue people, to link people between

346
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,518
them. And every information coming from the different people

347
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:05,622
are very, very important to grow in a very,

348
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:09,414
very inclusiveness way and the reliability and safety.

349
00:23:09,462 --> 00:23:12,940
That's true. You must be sure that you are using the right data

350
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,662
in the right way with a good supporting

351
00:23:16,726 --> 00:23:20,286
systems that can assure you that the system will

352
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:24,160
be available when it's needed, and not

353
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,550
just one time every week. For example,

354
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,118
something like this. The system must

355
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:35,186
offer you a

356
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:38,722
good slA, a good availability to support you every

357
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:42,770
time you need its support. And also give you few

358
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,290
pushes about something that you forgot

359
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,598
or something that you doesn't see your own.

360
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:54,018
So the second guideline

361
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:57,930
is to use the agile a approach and

362
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,078
this is based on four main experiments.

363
00:24:01,254 --> 00:24:05,098
Get started with those pre built I doesn't create

364
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:08,538
from scratch your solution, please select a standard

365
00:24:08,624 --> 00:24:12,270
solution coming from the market. Identify the right one. For example,

366
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,610
you can use a lot of machine learning algorithm

367
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,680
coming from a lot of cloud services provider and so on.

368
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,234
Leverage development tools. That means that when you start

369
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:31,074
in the implementation of your absolutisms or you are

370
00:24:31,112 --> 00:24:34,318
starting in the customization of prebuilt

371
00:24:34,414 --> 00:24:38,680
solutions, your point is to invest on these

372
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:45,394
tools and be sure that you can reinforce

373
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:50,134
them. You can support their evolutions

374
00:24:50,182 --> 00:24:54,198
because this is a very important investment for your organization

375
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:58,042
and you must be sure that you will

376
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,326
take all the Roy that you can extract for

377
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:05,280
them. Develop by people, for people. Remember that this

378
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,566
approach is not related to create automation without people.

379
00:25:09,748 --> 00:25:13,966
Is thinking to create tools

380
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:17,810
that can suggest to other people how to use

381
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,326
data, how they can improve

382
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:26,130
those company activities, company roles,

383
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,910
company improvement using data

384
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,846
coming from internal, coming from the internal environment and from

385
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:37,730
the external environment. So when you create these tools, when you select

386
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,580
these tools, you must think that these tools are for people,

387
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,794
not for machine. And you

388
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:51,274
also must be sure that you create that

389
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:55,354
your I must be ready for data state. And that's

390
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:59,022
another good point because it's very important to have the right data

391
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:02,738
and can data in

392
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:06,146
our activities because without that we can have the

393
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:09,826
risks that we will select too

394
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:13,314
much time, the wrong choices, the wrong options for

395
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:19,686
transform ourselves and that can create not

396
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:23,526
an efficient way to improve our

397
00:26:23,628 --> 00:26:26,760
organization. So thanks

398
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:30,950
to listening, thanks to arrive at the end of this presenting.

399
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,934
