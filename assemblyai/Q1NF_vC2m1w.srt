1
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,102
Imagine in this, it's Monday, the last

2
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,166
print of a project, and you just had a

3
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:35,958
planning, and you agreed with your team

4
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:39,222
that the things to do are to fix

5
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:43,074
two bugs, and you need to finish writing

6
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:46,594
the good documentation. You feel good. It's Monday,

7
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:50,522
but it's good Monday. What you agreed on is achievable,

8
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:53,258
and you're excited for the release.

9
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:57,534
You're also excited for what comes next. So you

10
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:59,310
feel good, you feel motivated.

11
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,750
Let's do it on Tuesday.

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,866
Engineering manager comes in the room, and she says,

13
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:11,300
look, it will be great if we can this

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,858
through the security. Just before the release.

15
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:18,454
Have you ever been in this situation? Do you know

16
00:01:18,492 --> 00:01:22,470
this pain? Well, you go to the meeting,

17
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,950
and security team asks you so many

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,950
questions. They ask about the documentation

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,082
that hasn't been finished yet. And after

20
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,220
the meeting, you end up with this.

21
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,734
Forget about those two bugs. It's a

22
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,606
whole bunch of bugs. And trust me, I also

23
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:52,320
don't understand what a snail is doing up there.

24
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,346
I've been in this situation way too many times.

25
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:02,980
And each time, we would have this beautiful

26
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,666
meeting called project, project retrospective,

27
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:11,846
and we would all agree in the team that,

28
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:15,958
well, having a security review in the last

29
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:19,930
sprint just before the release is

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,580
too stressful. It's just a horrible idea.

31
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,166
And as much as we would all agree and nod

32
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:31,934
our heads, the moment we close the door, we would

33
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:35,950
forget about it, and the situation would hunt us

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,120
down with every new project.

35
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,420
My name is Victoria Dalach. You can find me

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,706
in the Internet. I've been working tech for

37
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:54,222
over a decade, mostly as a backend engineer.

38
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:57,762
But two years ago, I transitioned

39
00:02:57,826 --> 00:03:00,520
to the security team in my company,

40
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,510
and it has been an amazing experience

41
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,962
because I could see the

42
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:14,060
same organization from completely

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,946
different angles. So when I

44
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:22,338
would go to a meeting with engineers

45
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:25,694
as an engineer, I would be like, oh, these are my peers. Like,

46
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:29,600
we share the struggle, we share the problems. We support each other.

47
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,322
But when I went to

48
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:37,090
another meeting as a security engineer,

49
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,106
all of a sudden, I was a

50
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:44,354
stakeholder. I was a person who wanted something.

51
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:48,370
I was a person who had

52
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,906
questions. I used to have questions as can engineer,

53
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:55,794
but you know what I mean. I would be the one who was blocking

54
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,600
stuff. What?

55
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,514
So I notice quite

56
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:09,146
a few problems with security, and I

57
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:13,578
will share something, a piece of security theory

58
00:04:13,674 --> 00:04:17,598
that will completely transform the way you approach security.

59
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay, are you ready? Let's go. So,

60
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,280
the problem with security is that,

61
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,186
first of all, there are many problems with security. Let's agree on

62
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,570
that. I will not cover all of them, but in product teams.

63
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,550
The problem I see is that product people, so product designers,

64
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,230
managers, owners, think about

65
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,880
security solely as an engineering problem.

66
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:52,150
And engineers are so focused on scoping

67
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,730
things right, making it achievable,

68
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,250
defining mvp, that they

69
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,062
label security features as nice

70
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:08,622
to have and put on a shelf with

71
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:12,430
other nice to have initiatives. And the problem is

72
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,530
that those features are hardly ever worked

73
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,146
on. But there is

74
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:25,074
another layer to that. Security is

75
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:29,414
a huge topic. I like to think about security as

76
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:33,782
an ocean. So when

77
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:37,366
I ask you, what do you think security

78
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:40,620
is? Or how do you know

79
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,170
if your product is secure?

80
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,810
How would you reply?

81
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,654
You can make it an experiment and ask your

82
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:55,470
peers, fellow engineers,

83
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,590
how do you know your product is secure?

84
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,826
And you will get different answers

85
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:07,154
from all the people. Security is

86
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:10,514
a huge topic. There is application security,

87
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:13,940
cloud security, infrastructure security. It security.

88
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,458
When we think about application security,

89
00:06:19,624 --> 00:06:23,270
only they have vulnerabilities, risk factors,

90
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,400
threats, so many of them,

91
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,330
it's overwhelming. And the lingo.

92
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,010
Oh, my gosh. The lingo security people

93
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,180
use is difficult to understand.

94
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,942
So, before I joined security team, I had

95
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:48,794
thought that we as developers, have weird

96
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:52,654
way of talking because we use a lot of different

97
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:56,020
weird words. But when I joined security,

98
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,690
the first six months, I would Google acronyms

99
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,054
for, like, at least three to ten acronyms

100
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:08,614
a day. So there are many

101
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:12,230
layers where security is just overwhelming.

102
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,342
But I bring you

103
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:20,586
hope, because I

104
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,540
have something very exciting to share.

105
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:28,380
We can all agree security.

106
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,126
We can all agree that there

107
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:38,910
is an infinite amount of threats.

108
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,560
Can of threats, you may say.

109
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,406
We cannot identify

110
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:52,018
all the attack vectors that your

111
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:54,820
application is vulnerable to.

112
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,398
We cannot do that. There is an infinite amount of threats. And every

113
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:02,790
week, you got news

114
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,134
about our new vulnerabilities found in libraries that

115
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:09,990
everyone uses. Infinite amount of threats.

116
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,420
However, this is beautiful.

117
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,530
Wait for it. All of them.

118
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,246
All of those threads can be assigned to one of

119
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:24,366
three categories. This will be

120
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:28,080
an acronym, but I think you know it.

121
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,534
Those three categories are confidentiality,

122
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,850
integrity, and availability.

123
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,290
And this is called the CIA triad.

124
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,834
I could make a joke about spice,

125
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:50,246
but I will not do that, because the only spice I

126
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:53,030
like to think about are spice girls.

127
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,486
Forgive me. Why is

128
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:04,406
it so exciting? The CIA triad. Why is it so exciting?

129
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:07,978
Why is it something that I want to talk about to you,

130
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:11,646
and I want you to later talk about with

131
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:16,142
your peers? Why? Because the

132
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:20,414
CIA triad let us put the

133
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,830
whole ocean into three buckets,

134
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,302
and it's a very impactful thing. But before

135
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,750
I tell you, why is it so impactful?

136
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,440
Let me just define what CIA means.

137
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,678
Confidentiality means that we

138
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:47,490
want secrets to be secret.

139
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,394
If I send you an email or you

140
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:55,142
send me an email telling me how did you like this

141
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,470
talk? We only want

142
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,038
us to read it. We don't want anyone

143
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:04,760
else to interfere in our communication. Right.

144
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,826
Integrity means that we get what

145
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:14,234
we expect. So when you log into your email,

146
00:10:14,432 --> 00:10:18,014
you want to see all of your emails, right? It would

147
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:22,046
be very weird if you had all

148
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:27,870
of your data lost availability.

149
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,940
We can always access the information.

150
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,226
So we expect that you can send me

151
00:10:36,248 --> 00:10:40,354
this email 10:00 p.m.

152
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:43,000
Or 03:00 a.m. In the morning.

153
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,430
No matter when you can send

154
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,470
email, you can access Instagram.

155
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,746
Your application will work 24/7 right?

156
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:58,330
This is availability.

157
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,410
Okay, so how is it helpful?

158
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,470
How is it helpful? You see,

159
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,918
it is helpful because it

160
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,640
transform the way you can approach security.

161
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,074
Instead of thinking of oh,

162
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:23,810
I want my application to be secure,

163
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,746
how do I do that? Oh, this is this vulnerability. Do we have

164
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:33,342
this vulnerability? Okay, we don't. That's good.

165
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:36,742
And this vulnerability we don't have.

166
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:40,040
Okay. And this, oh, we need to fix something.

167
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,574
This is completely overwhelming. How are you

168
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:47,194
supposed to, as a developer, remember about all

169
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:51,690
of those things? It's impossible.

170
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,610
So the CIA triad is

171
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,280
very helpful because instead

172
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,730
of going from threats,

173
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,670
vulnerabilities lists,

174
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,434
you take a step back and

175
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:14,660
you ask the question,

176
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,660
the question, the CIA question,

177
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,462
which is how

178
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:29,222
can the CIA of this

179
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:31,270
project be broken?

180
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,474
I don't know if you can fear, but it

181
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,060
excites me every time.

182
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,820
Think about your current project.

183
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,534
Do you have it? Okay, you can

184
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:55,214
ask the CIA question for it. Let's do it.

185
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:59,294
How can the CIA of you

186
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:02,210
say it be broken?

187
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,610
How can the CIA of your project be broken?

188
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,650
It's so powerful because it works

189
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,402
for everything. It works no matter if you are backend,

190
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:21,174
front end, mobile, if you work in a cloud or

191
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:25,270
not. If you are junior developer,

192
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,930
meet senior staff,

193
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,266
whatever director. If you are product manager, you also can

194
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:35,340
ask this question. If you're a designer, you can ask this question.

195
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,640
This will work forever for you.

196
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,054
How can the CIA of the thing I'm working on

197
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,400
be broken? And of course,

198
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,940
if you want to answer this question, you will

199
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,162
need to dig deeper and ask

200
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:04,770
more questions. And for each category,

201
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,590
confidentiality, integrity and availability. You will

202
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,934
ask questions specific to

203
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:13,720
your project.

204
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,494
But here let me share some ideas,

205
00:14:19,542 --> 00:14:25,050
some examples of questions you can ask confidentiality

206
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,386
who can see this resource? How do I store

207
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,810
credentials? Do we log sensitive

208
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,622
data for

209
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:40,442
integrity? Who can create update

210
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,910
remove a resource?

211
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,138
What happens when a malicious data

212
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:53,026
is sent via form is

213
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:56,214
the input sanitized? Are we

214
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:59,538
protected against cross site scripting?

215
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:02,840
These are examples of integrity questions.

216
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,842
Availability, is this endpoint rate

217
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:12,730
limited? What happens when external product

218
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,122
is down? How much time does

219
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:19,810
this database migration

220
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,498
take? These are availability

221
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:27,342
questions. And let me just stop for a second

222
00:15:27,476 --> 00:15:33,234
with the availability, because I

223
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:36,770
get this often that when I say availability,

224
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,914
developers stop listening because we

225
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:45,634
think, ah, availability infrastructure

226
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:48,200
group, infrastructure team.

227
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,446
But this is not necessarily true.

228
00:15:53,548 --> 00:15:57,566
I mean, it's not true at all, because as developers

229
00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:00,598
we introduce new products, new libraries,

230
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:04,906
which means dependencies. And you really need to think about

231
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:08,346
what happens when this great product that

232
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,950
you use for managing feature flags go down.

233
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,720
Does it mean that our whole product is down?

234
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,654
Availability. Don't skip it when

235
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:25,954
you do this CIA questioning with

236
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:26,740
your team.

237
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,082
So now the question is when

238
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:38,950
should you do this? Okay, so you maybe understand

239
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,400
what the CIA triad is now.

240
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,062
We talked about it, I told you about the

241
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:48,634
questions, but when

242
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:52,298
should you do this? Like your practice is already full and

243
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:56,170
booked. So I cannot

244
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,278
answer this question without telling you about shifting security

245
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:05,182
left. Shift security left is this new way

246
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:06,960
of thinking about security.

247
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,858
And if you ever meet an application

248
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:16,274
security engineer, probably in your

249
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:20,514
company, ask them what shift security left means,

250
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:23,860
because they will be probably thrilled to tell you more.

251
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,120
But the idea is that when we look at the

252
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,982
software development lifecycle, right, we have five

253
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:37,138
phases, requirement analysis,

254
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:40,394
analysis, design. Can I count

255
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:44,570
on my fingers? Design, implementation, testing and

256
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,690
evolution.

257
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,334
But here's the thing, so I've been doing this way

258
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:57,760
too long. I don't think we are

259
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,866
working in a lifecycle. It's more like

260
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:06,750
a timeline. We do analysis,

261
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,514
design, we develop, we test, and then

262
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,540
we release and maintain, right?

263
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,990
And after we release, we just move on to the next project.

264
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,390
So it's never really a lifecycle.

265
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,760
If your experience is different, let me know.

266
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,434
Anywho, we have this timeline and

267
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:32,790
what happens. Remember the story I told you in the beginning?

268
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,300
We had security review

269
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,174
just before the release. It was on the right side of

270
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:45,150
this product development timeline.

271
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,402
So shifting security left means shifting

272
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,314
security, thinking about security,

273
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:55,746
approaching security to the design

274
00:18:55,848 --> 00:18:58,898
phase, right?

275
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:02,420
So why is it so important?

276
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,970
Because in the design phase,

277
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,454
creating changes is very easy. Because what

278
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:14,950
you do, you only, I don't know, change a document, change a graph.

279
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,960
You basically work on a piece of paper.

280
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,794
Whereas when you have security review

281
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:26,122
just before the release, the changes are

282
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:27,610
extremely expensive.

283
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,558
Not to mention how expensive they get. When you already release a

284
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:36,202
thing, that's horrible. And it's more stressful,

285
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:39,822
it takes more time, it's more

286
00:19:39,876 --> 00:19:42,910
expensive, it's terrible.

287
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,850
Shifting security left says hey,

288
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,626
let's talk about security of this thing that we are working on

289
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:52,500
before we even code.

290
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,462
Let's agree on that so we can have some kind of

291
00:19:57,516 --> 00:20:01,190
confidence that what we are building is secure.

292
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:07,786
This is shifting security left. So how

293
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:11,594
do you implement this CIA triad in

294
00:20:11,632 --> 00:20:14,998
your company, in your practice,

295
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:18,874
you inject it basically what

296
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:22,442
it means, present it to your peers,

297
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:26,654
you can send them this small

298
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:30,954
video, discuss it with your team, discuss approaching

299
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:34,660
security earlier. Invite your security team

300
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,690
to discussions so they have some

301
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,940
kind of input and they can help you and guide you.

302
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,160
But also make it part of your process

303
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,158
because in order we talk about scaling a

304
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:55,186
lot. Security cannot

305
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:57,430
be just an ad hoc action.

306
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,794
It needs to be part of your process. And how do you do that?

307
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:06,202
The easiest thing except of telling people

308
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:11,166
about it is to update the

309
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,606
documentation like documentation templates. So if

310
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:18,698
you have documentation templates like solution

311
00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:22,586
briefs, enhancement proposal, request for

312
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:26,018
comments, et cetera, add security section there,

313
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:29,602
add CIA triad show. Hey, how will this

314
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,690
affect confidentiality, integrity, availability?

315
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,066
How can we break it? How can this new feature

316
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:41,670
break confidentiality, integrity and availability?

317
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,030
And it will help you work

318
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,650
and create more secure solutions.

319
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,026
Important thing, you don't have to do it on your own.

320
00:21:56,208 --> 00:22:00,166
Those can discussions are

321
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,870
meant to be run together in the team and

322
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,814
the more perspectives you bring the better.

323
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:10,494
So you don't have to focus on back ends only.

324
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:14,238
Like bring front end engineers in

325
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:17,934
the room, bring a designer product manager.

326
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:23,106
How can you create find a solution that

327
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:27,286
is basically a compromise between business

328
00:22:27,468 --> 00:22:31,654
and security? Compromise, is it a great

329
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:35,382
word? I think so. Like what we need is some kind of

330
00:22:35,516 --> 00:22:37,990
connection, some kind of understanding.

331
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:45,114
You can do it to

332
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:47,660
finish up. Look,

333
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,054
there is no week when we don't hear about

334
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:56,254
a data breach or vulnerability that is in

335
00:22:56,292 --> 00:23:00,110
this super important library that everyone

336
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,810
uses. We need to

337
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,986
as engineers step up and

338
00:23:08,008 --> 00:23:11,874
we need to understand that things that we are building have

339
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:15,250
a huge impact on people's life.

340
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,620
We need to take responsibility for that.

341
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,558
The colorless times of moved fast

342
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:25,526
and break things are over and

343
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:27,640
it's a good thing actually.

344
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,858
I hope that the CIA triad will

345
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,942
help you create more secure software,

346
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:39,610
approach security in an easier way,

347
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,380
moved manageable and

348
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,900
I think you will have great fun.

349
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,140
Thank you for joining me today. Thank you for listening me

350
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,026
and please let's stay in touch.

351
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,580
I'm online. Well,

352
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,658
thank you,
