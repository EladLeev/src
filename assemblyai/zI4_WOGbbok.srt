00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,594
Welcome to the lightning talk on Athens to algorithms,

2
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:46,166
what the ancient greek philosopher Zeno can tell us

3
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:49,458
about tech leadership in the 21st century.

4
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:52,974
I'm Jim Murphy. I'm going to be talking about this topic for

5
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:56,414
roughly 15 to 20 minutes. A quick lightning talk.

6
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:59,854
And I like to start my presentations with a

7
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:03,850
story that humiliates me. I do this for a couple of reasons.

8
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,282
I do it because I want you to understand why this

9
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:11,374
topic is meaningful for me and why I put it together to hopefully

10
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:14,786
help you empathize with the content. But I also do

11
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,722
it so that you feel sorry for me and vote my talk highly.

12
00:01:18,866 --> 00:01:22,646
So hopefully I can do that. The story I'm going

13
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:26,550
to tell is actually putting together this talk. I love

14
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,750
mathematics. I love learning about mathematics.

15
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,662
And I learn about a greek mathematician,

16
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,220
Xeno, and things like Xeno's paradox and

17
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,974
the work that he did in that area. And I

18
00:01:41,012 --> 00:01:44,526
also learn about stoicism and the concept of

19
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:47,278
stoicism. And I had this person,

20
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:51,354
Xeno, in investigating this. I thought these two Zeno

21
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,662
were actually the same person. And I put a whole introductory

22
00:01:55,806 --> 00:01:59,486
part to this presentation about the mathematics

23
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:03,234
that Zeno did, only to present it for the first time and

24
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:07,014
have a good friend of mine say, andrew, those are two different

25
00:02:07,052 --> 00:02:10,534
Zeno. Turns out Zeno is the

26
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:13,698
John Smith of the ancient greek era,

27
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:17,094
and these two xenos have nothing to do with each other. So I am

28
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:21,466
not going to be talking about Xeno's paradox. I'm not going to be talking about

29
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,886
turtles and arrows. I'm going to be talking about Zeno

30
00:02:24,918 --> 00:02:28,182
of Sitium, who was an ancient greek philosopher

31
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:31,594
and created and helped create a lot of concepts,

32
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:35,342
the one of which we're going to talk the most in depth about today

33
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:39,358
is stoicism and how stoicism can

34
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:43,230
be tied into technology leadership. So I mentioned,

35
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,802
I'm Andrew Murphy. I want to tell you a little bit more about me

36
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:49,810
before we go into the meat of this presentation.

37
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,734
I am a long term father of a flock of chickens,

38
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,742
or as we call them in Australia, chucks.

39
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:01,094
I'm a short term father of a flock of humans, or as

40
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:04,258
we call them in Australia, financial burdens.

41
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,166
And I really like travel. I love getting around the world. And this

42
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,314
will come into play a little bit later in our discussion from

43
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,510
a professional point of view. I've been a coder

44
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,082
and a programmer for as long as I can remember.

45
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:22,830
I learned to write code very, very early,

46
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,206
and I've been paid to write code for about

47
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:29,930
20 years at this point. But I also had a few formative

48
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,166
experiences that got me into the told of

49
00:03:33,188 --> 00:03:36,626
technology leadership really, really early. By the

50
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:40,242
time I was 24 years old, I was running

51
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:43,730
a team of ten people. And I don't say that to say,

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,398
wow, aren't I awesome for running a team of ten people?

53
00:03:47,564 --> 00:03:50,930
I sucked at it. I was a bad leader.

54
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,398
What 24 year old knows how to be an

55
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:59,466
employee, let alone a leader of people? And so I

56
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:03,306
made a bunch of mistakes. And unfortunately, when you're a leader and you

57
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:06,906
make mistakes, often those mistakes are at the expense of

58
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:10,966
the people you lead. So this lent

59
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:14,398
me to go on a pathway of learning to be a

60
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:18,158
better leader, learning to understand the skills of leadership. Two, the point

61
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:21,694
where I taught other leaders how to lead,

62
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:25,234
taught new leaders to understand the concepts of leadership and the

63
00:04:25,272 --> 00:04:29,870
difference between being an excellent individual contributor

64
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,746
and an excellent leader, and what the difference between those two

65
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:37,206
was. This has now led me to run my

66
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:40,738
own company, tech leader's launchpad, which focuses solely

67
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:44,162
on helping new and emerging tech leader understand their roles

68
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:47,030
better through training, coaching,

69
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,870
and consultation. Let's talk

70
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,406
a little bit more about Zeno.

71
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:57,434
Zeno was an ancient greek philosopher. He was born on

72
00:04:57,472 --> 00:05:01,414
the island of Cyprus. Cyprus is in the middle of the Mediterranean.

73
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:05,006
It's an island that I've been to many, many times, if you

74
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:08,574
can't tell from the accent. I grew up in England, and so

75
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:12,026
Cyprus was a mere four or five hour plane ride

76
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:16,002
away, which might sound a lot for those of you who live

77
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:19,118
in Europe, but now that I live in Australia,

78
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:22,466
you get on a plane for 4 hours and you're still in the country.

79
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:26,434
So it's something I miss. Being from Europe

80
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:30,614
is that ability to travel. Zeno is part

81
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:33,942
of a whole tranche of philosophers who came up about the same

82
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:37,454
time at around the third to fourth

83
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:41,114
century BC. They focused on learning

84
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:45,366
a lot about philosophy, coming up with a bunch of theories and concepts

85
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:48,646
and ideas that in the modern

86
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:52,400
era, we just kind of take as part of who we are.

87
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,874
The three that I've highlighted at the bottom in those pictures on that slide

88
00:05:57,002 --> 00:06:00,458
are logos. The first, the idea of logic.

89
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:04,370
Somebody had to invent the idea of logic, which just seems

90
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,094
so strange to us nowadays, that logic didn't exist

91
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:11,106
at some point and somebody created it. But he,

92
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:16,254
along with a few other people, created and fundamentalized

93
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:19,686
the idea of logic and predicates and things that

94
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:23,926
are either true or not true, and how you can reason and

95
00:06:24,028 --> 00:06:27,474
decide whether one thing is true based on other things being

96
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:31,162
true or not being true. He also was

97
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:35,290
fundamental in a concept called cosmopolitanism.

98
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,094
Not the drink

99
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:42,090
that you see in the picture, which is named after the concept,

100
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,566
but cosmopolitanism is this idea that

101
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:49,582
we are not citizens of a country or a city

102
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:52,878
or a tribe. We are citizens of the world.

103
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:56,190
You are either an individual human being,

104
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,762
or you are a citizen of the world. And there is nothing in the middle

105
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:03,394
of those. You don't belong to a tribe or a creed or

106
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:06,862
a race or a country or a region.

107
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:10,294
You are part of the world. And I really like this

108
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:14,262
idea. As somebody who was born in northern Europe and now lives

109
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:18,694
in Australia, I love the freedom that we can have to

110
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:22,266
travel and see the world and to learn and to become part of

111
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:25,962
it and to break down those boundaries. I think there's nothing better and nothing

112
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:30,054
more important in the world than seeing it and

113
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,160
seeing the people that are in it.

114
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,400
And lastly, the main topic of the discussion today.

115
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,490
He was fundamental in the creation

116
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,930
of stoicism. He taught a

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,462
whole idea around stoicism,

118
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:52,030
which is fundamentally in that one image.

119
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,446
That image in the bottom right is stoicism in

120
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:58,914
a single image. Let's go into that, and let's talk about the basics

121
00:07:58,962 --> 00:08:02,994
of stoicism. This is stoicism in a single image.

122
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:06,546
It's represented as a triangle.

123
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:09,450
And the points of the Triangle,

124
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,118
the angles of it, represent the three tenets

125
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:18,010
of stoicism. At the bottom

126
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,346
right is something called the dichotomy of control. That's fundamental.

127
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,822
Two stoics. It's the idea that you should focus

128
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:29,486
on that which you can control and only that which you can

129
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:33,366
control. You should forget about or accept

130
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:36,754
those things which you can't control in order to

131
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:40,514
save the time and energy to focus on the things you can control.

132
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:44,990
And we'll dive into that later. The top

133
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,742
angle is, take responsibility for

134
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:52,722
the actions you take, the judgments you make. Take responsibility

135
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:55,320
for those things which are in your control.

136
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,186
So if we are separating the world through the

137
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,626
dichotomy of control into things we can control and things

138
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:07,590
we can't control, then we should take responsibility

139
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,742
for the things we can control. Then in the bottom

140
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:14,958
left is hopefully through doing those

141
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:18,926
things, through focusing on the things we can control and

142
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:22,962
taking responsibility for them. We can live

143
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:27,294
with arate, which roughly translates

144
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:29,860
to living your best self.

145
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,842
And by doing these things, we hopefully

146
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:38,834
lead towards this concept of eudaimonia,

147
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:42,626
which literally translates as happy inner

148
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,926
demon. But modern usage of

149
00:09:45,948 --> 00:09:50,074
the word demon doesn't really translate in the same way. You can

150
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:52,620
think of it more as happy inner self.

151
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,762
And so by focusing on what we can control,

152
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,100
taking responsibility for it,

153
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,834
focusing on improving ourselves. By living with arate,

154
00:10:03,962 --> 00:10:07,726
we hopefully reach this state of eudaimonia, this happy

155
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:10,560
inner spirit, if we want to use that word.

156
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,086
And that's the three core

157
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:18,658
tenets that no matter what happens to us around

158
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:22,370
us, we should focus on what we can control,

159
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,000
take responsibility for our judgments, and live

160
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,022
by constantly improving ourselves with

161
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:35,542
arate. So at this point, you're probably asking

162
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:39,434
me, Andrew, we're almost ten minutes into this talk. What does

163
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,954
this have to do with tech leadership? Let's get there.

164
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:46,774
Let's talk about how these concepts of stoicism

165
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:51,760
apply very directly to being a tech leader in 2024.

166
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,506
The first concept is applying the stoic dichotomy

167
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:59,582
of control. Focus on what we can control. So, really,

168
00:10:59,636 --> 00:11:02,806
what it's saying is, we can control our actions,

169
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:06,430
reactions, and attitudes, but we cannot

170
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,190
control external events or other people's

171
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,934
actions, reactions, and attitudes. We can influence

172
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,920
those things, but we cannot control them.

173
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,206
And so if we look at what that means in

174
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:24,422
leadership, there are a certain list of things

175
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,378
that are in our control, and we should focus on those things,

176
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:32,186
and there are a certain list of things that are not in

177
00:11:32,288 --> 00:11:35,926
our control. And so what's

178
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,942
in our control, for example, is managing

179
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:43,902
our team effectively. We can control this. It is within

180
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:47,120
our power to affect change in that area.

181
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,130
What is not in our control are the team dynamics,

182
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,782
when you join your team, and we could often

183
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:58,706
find ourselves, when we join a new team, going, oh, I wish things were

184
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:02,670
different, or, why did they have to get into this? Or they've got bad mindsets,

185
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,566
bad habits, bad skill sets.

186
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:09,622
It's so frustrating the way they are, and it's just

187
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:13,542
causing me two kind of give up hope that I can ever

188
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:17,014
help this team become the best they can be.

189
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:21,562
The stoic would say, it doesn't matter why

190
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,774
they got to where they are, and you weren't

191
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:28,426
in control of that situation, but you are in control

192
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:31,886
of how you go forward with it. You are in control with how

193
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:35,722
that makes you feel, and you are in control of the judgments

194
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:38,890
that you make in order to progress

195
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,694
forward. Now, we can have an interesting debate

196
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,434
around the fact that you don't want

197
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:49,634
to completely ignore how the team got

198
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:52,786
to where they are, but fixating on it

199
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:56,022
and using it as an excuse for

200
00:12:56,076 --> 00:13:01,442
why you can't progress or feeling like it's

201
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:05,206
an obstacle you cannot overcome in order to improve the team

202
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,694
doesn't help anybody. Another thing you can't control

203
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:12,418
are market dynamics. I'm recording this

204
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:13,466
at the start of 2024.

205
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,886
2023 was a rough

206
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:20,486
year. 2022, end of 2022 was an even

207
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:24,126
rougher period for our industry. We can't control that.

208
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:27,614
We can't control the market dynamics. But what we

209
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:31,610
can do is constantly develop our team, their skills

210
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,830
and their ability to handle these situations.

211
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,574
If we just throw our hands up and go, the market is terrible,

212
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:41,906
there's nothing we can do, and woe is us, then that's not

213
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:45,066
going to help you. It's going to just give you an excuse.

214
00:13:45,118 --> 00:13:49,398
It's just going to make you frustrated and give up.

215
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:53,494
Whereas if you focus on the things you can control, which is how you

216
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:57,558
respond to that situation, you can focus

217
00:13:57,644 --> 00:14:01,066
on the development and improvement of your team to help them

218
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:04,586
better respond to the situation. Lastly, in the

219
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:07,910
things we can't control, user and client decisions.

220
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,514
For those of you who work in consultancies, you know that often

221
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:15,534
clients don't make decisions that are in their best interests or the best

222
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:19,742
interests of their users. And so you can often feel frustrated and

223
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:24,346
angry that the client just doesn't get it. And why are they making these decisions?

224
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:28,146
That is not productive and conducive to a healthy relationship with

225
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:32,114
the client. But it's also not useful for you as an individual to

226
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:36,690
feel this sense of anger, frustration and resentment constantly.

227
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,222
And letting go of that and accepting that that is

228
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:44,406
the way it is and we have to respond to that,

229
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,846
means that what we should actually be doing is focusing

230
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:51,398
on building teams and prowess and systems and software

231
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:54,858
that are responsive to change, and that

232
00:14:54,944 --> 00:14:58,650
enable us to innovate and adjust

233
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,386
and improve the way we do things when these decisions

234
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:07,178
inevitably don't go the way we expect, or when those decisions

235
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:11,294
are changing constantly. And so all

236
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:14,642
of these things, this dichotomy of control and this

237
00:15:14,776 --> 00:15:18,354
giving, not allowing those things

238
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:21,934
that are not in our control to drive our emotions to such a deep

239
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:25,686
extent, but also accepting our part in how

240
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,522
we move forward, means that we're leading towards rational

241
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:32,418
decision making. As a technology leader,

242
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:35,846
understanding this dichotomy of control means we

243
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,594
can understand the things in which we have influence over

244
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:42,842
and the things we don't, and therefore devote our

245
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:46,490
efforts where they are most effective.

246
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,850
Second, in our stoic principles is taking responsibility

247
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,638
for our judgments. What do I mean by judgments? I don't mean

248
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:58,090
wearing a wig and making proceedings

249
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,694
over things in a courtroom. I mean the decisions we

250
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:05,410
make and the actions we take based

251
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,946
on things that happen to us, the events that happen in our lives,

252
00:16:09,048 --> 00:16:12,594
and also the emotional responses that those

253
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:16,454
events trigger. We cannot control the

254
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:20,178
emotional response that we get to certain circumstances,

255
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:24,258
there's always going two be things that push us beyond

256
00:16:24,354 --> 00:16:28,230
our ability to stay composed and our ability

257
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,702
to not trigger an emotional response.

258
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:35,146
We have this word trigger, which means we are sometimes

259
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:40,274
rationally or irrationally emotionally evoked

260
00:16:40,342 --> 00:16:44,000
by certain circumstances. And this

261
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,222
idea of taking responsibility for our judgments is

262
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:51,706
not about having a suppression

263
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:56,366
of those emotional responses. It's about understanding

264
00:16:56,478 --> 00:17:00,386
the reactions, the actions, the judgments we make

265
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:04,606
after we feel those emotions and allowing

266
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:08,754
us to change those based on those emotional responses.

267
00:17:08,882 --> 00:17:12,642
It's really difficult for us to change those emotional responses

268
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:16,470
themselves. But what we can do is control

269
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,458
the judgments, the actions, reactions that we

270
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:23,290
take because of those emotions.

271
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,778
So you can think about this as a process,

272
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:30,086
as a series on a flowchart. There's the

273
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:33,742
event that happens. We have no control over

274
00:17:33,796 --> 00:17:38,234
that at all. There's the emotional response

275
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:42,142
we have because of that event. We have very

276
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:46,162
little emotional control over that. We can,

277
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:50,466
through other processes, like CBT and

278
00:17:50,488 --> 00:17:54,402
like, we can influence that. But sometimes it's really difficult to change

279
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:58,290
those emotional responses. But as logical

280
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,814
homo sapiens, we do have control over the

281
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:05,446
actions and reactions, or as stoicism will call them,

282
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:09,506
the judgments. We do have control over those. And so that's

283
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,682
where we should focus our energy. That's where we should focus.

284
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:16,246
Our effort is accepting the fact we can't

285
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:19,866
control the events and the emotions, but we can control those actions and

286
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:23,866
reactions, and therefore, we should take responsibility

287
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,598
for those. Really what we're talking about here

288
00:18:27,684 --> 00:18:31,182
is emotional resilience, understanding those things

289
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,974
that are within our control and what emotions those evoke

290
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:38,626
and allowing ourselves. Two, understand that those emotions are

291
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:42,638
sometimes not able to be controlled immediately,

292
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:46,006
but we can control the actions and reactions that

293
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:49,766
those emotions evoke in us. Lastly is the

294
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:53,346
concept of living with arate by expressing

295
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:56,598
our best self. What am I talking about with that?

296
00:18:56,684 --> 00:19:00,538
Well, this is about living up to your full potential through empathy and

297
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:05,098
constant learning and development. We have

298
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:08,918
so much around us that enables us to improve ourselves.

299
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:12,874
And the world is constantly changing. The industry

300
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:16,074
we're in is constantly changing. The technologies are constantly

301
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:20,058
changing. And if we just accept status quo,

302
00:19:20,154 --> 00:19:22,750
then we're not living with arate.

303
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,134
And this means we can't reach that state of eudaimonia,

304
00:19:27,182 --> 00:19:31,230
this happy inner demon. And so constant

305
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,862
focus on what we can do to improve ourselves

306
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,940
is living with a stoic life.

307
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,926
What are the areas in which we can improve? What are the areas in which

308
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:46,070
we can strengthen? What are the areas in which we can invest time

309
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,162
in improving ourselves? This means we're going to be able to tackle

310
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:54,026
everything better. We're going to improve our judgments. We're going to be able to

311
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:57,754
increase the sphere of influence of our dichotomy of

312
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:01,242
control. We're going to be able to improve ourselves constantly.

313
00:20:01,386 --> 00:20:05,002
This isn't about investing

314
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:08,426
every single hour of every single day into getting better, but it's

315
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,634
just being aware that there is this stoic

316
00:20:12,682 --> 00:20:15,714
principle of just what have you done this week?

317
00:20:15,752 --> 00:20:18,786
What have you done this month? What have you done this year to improve yourself?

318
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:23,330
Because living with stoicism is constantly improvement

319
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,510
as a leader. There's another interesting dynamic here,

320
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,806
which is that in doing this, we're setting an example for others to

321
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:33,938
follow. If we show ourselves

322
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:37,174
as somebody who wants two improve, wants to get better,

323
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:40,280
then we're encouraging that behavior in other people.

324
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,010
And what we're also doing is showing that we're not perfect.

325
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,606
We have flaws, we have things we can get better at. And that enables

326
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:51,374
other people to be open about the areas in which they can

327
00:20:51,412 --> 00:20:54,766
improve and they can get better at. So we're talking here about

328
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:58,750
the concept of continual self improvement

329
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,626
calls, right? So I want to end with a quote

330
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:07,202
from Zeno themselves, which is that

331
00:21:07,256 --> 00:21:10,530
man conquers the world by conquering himself.

332
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,830
I apologize for the very gendered language in this quote.

333
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:18,498
Zeno, like I said, is from three to 400 bc.

334
00:21:18,674 --> 00:21:23,094
We would write this very differently nowadays, but hopefully the

335
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:26,994
concepts resonate, which is if we want to exert

336
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:31,142
influence on the world, we have to exert influence on ourselves.

337
00:21:31,286 --> 00:21:35,034
And we can do that through many ways. One of them that

338
00:21:35,072 --> 00:21:38,006
Zeno himself would advocate, and I would advocate,

339
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:42,758
is by living with the principles of stoicism,

340
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,790
especially if you're a technology leader.

341
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,646
To wrap up, I want to share a couple of links with you if you

342
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:53,582
want to know more about me and what I do. I do regular live streams

343
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,958
on LinkedIn where I talk about technology leadership topics.

344
00:21:57,134 --> 00:22:00,654
I also post content on there pretty regularly,

345
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:03,986
and I have a blog. All of

346
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:07,078
those are in the QR codes that you can see in front of you.

347
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:10,642
There's also a link to tech leader's launchpad,

348
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:14,438
which is my online technology leadership training

349
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:18,070
platform where I've got a bunch of great courses that help you become

350
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,830
a better technology leader in whatever area you need

351
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,894
help in. If you've got any questions, feel free to reach

352
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:29,480
out to me. I love talking about this stuff and

353
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,470
will love to have a continued conversation about

354
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,926
where you see this fits in with your lives. I'll see

355
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:37,340
you next time.
