00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,906
Hello and welcome to my talk. I'm going to be sharing a bunch of anecdotes

2
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:33,618
that encouraged during my last decade of development.

3
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:37,058
And there has been a bunch of crazy stuff, mostly due

4
00:00:37,074 --> 00:00:40,262
to myself. First anecdotes in

5
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:44,370
the series that I chose based on no order whatsoever

6
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,250
is how I learned to do Linux administration.

7
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,422
Basically it was the middle of the night, which is a perfect time for doing

8
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:55,146
any sort of administration Linux production servers.

9
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:58,526
So I wanted to delete some stuff. It was in a

10
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:01,854
separate directory and normally I'm going to delete it

11
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:05,262
with using pseudo privileges. So pseudo

12
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:08,210
remove recursively everything under slash.

13
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,242
Now for those not so versed into Linux as I was

14
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:16,098
that moment that deletes everything from hard drive.

15
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:20,354
And good thing is some things stay in memory. So there exists

16
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:24,406
at a brief moment in time there was absolutely nothing on

17
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:28,438
the hard drive, but website was working after 30 seconds.

18
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:32,234
Once the realization hit me about what I just did,

19
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:36,234
I had to boot up the new server, install all

20
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:39,546
the requirements, do got deployment, set up

21
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:42,890
all permission, check if everything is working correctly,

22
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,006
and dont DNS server to that. Now that

23
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,654
woke me up very fast. If you want to switch from Red

24
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:54,666
Bull or coffee, I warmly recommend deleting

25
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:58,750
production servers. That's going to wake you up very quickly. And I remembered

26
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,126
almost everything from stack orderflow that I googled

27
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:05,394
in that panicked moment. So that's how you should

28
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:08,534
start your morning now. Another crazy stuff that I

29
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:11,794
did was basically using text editor

30
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:14,982
for the development. I know there are some super smart people,

31
00:02:15,036 --> 00:02:18,950
they can do text editor for development of complex

32
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,458
programs, but myself am got among them.

33
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:25,782
I love my autocomplete, I love syntax checking,

34
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,774
all that stuff. So using Notepad,

35
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:32,394
notepad Plus, but just notepad for

36
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:35,726
the first two or three weeks of my career was

37
00:02:35,748 --> 00:02:38,894
not a good choice. To make it even better, I was

38
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:42,222
doing basically had one file would write into it,

39
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:46,162
then FTP uploads to the production server because what

40
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:50,242
else? And if I managed to mess

41
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:53,778
up the PHP syntax production site would crash. But that

42
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:57,518
was okay because client was in USA and you would

43
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,414
not notice that. So develop in the completely opposite time

44
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:04,758
zone of your clients. That's a very good lesson if you're going to use

45
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:09,046
production server for your testing purposes later. I did realize how

46
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:13,062
you can create your local environment and why you should have a staging

47
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,538
environment and dev environment when it comes to that.

48
00:03:16,704 --> 00:03:19,594
Things that I learned after that is version control.

49
00:03:19,712 --> 00:03:23,598
That was super amazing stuff that I discovered before entire

50
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:26,734
mankind. Since what I was doing is

51
00:03:26,852 --> 00:03:30,522
every time I would upload a file to production server

52
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:34,254
using FTTP. I would just make

53
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:37,810
copy of that file with a timestamp and that way I could return

54
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,266
to it later if there was need for that. I was watching YouTube at

55
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,786
the time and I saw somebody talking about version control and

56
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,406
I realized this cool, be good. I started using it and

57
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:51,622
it was super fun. Then I think it was two years

58
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:55,510
after I realized that branches existed in git and after that

59
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,554
everything was super awesome. Another thing that is super useful

60
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:03,418
is you should always try to be the smartest person in

61
00:04:03,424 --> 00:04:07,114
the room. That way everything you say is absolutely correct,

62
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:10,826
no matter how insane it is. Since we were working at the startup in the

63
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:14,890
first company we didn't have lots of resources, so we hired a bunch of juniors

64
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,450
and me with my six months of experience was leading them technical

65
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,022
disaster in all the possible ways. Seniors are

66
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:26,626
expensive, but they are less expensive than juniors. Try to have

67
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:30,034
a mix of them and company culture is important.

68
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:33,426
Also, I realize I can be pretty stupid at

69
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:37,686
the time, so I need somebody smarter to tell me when I'm making crazy stuff.

70
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:41,058
Now that first startup was done, I realized,

71
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:44,726
okay, in the end we managed to create something good because it was a

72
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:48,910
search engine, it had some super good performances

73
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,286
and you could get the listing from million track articles

74
00:04:53,398 --> 00:04:57,082
in less than 15 milliseconds. With the solar that's super good.

75
00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:00,454
Now design was created by me in the first version,

76
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,902
which means that everybody who visited that website started

77
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:07,530
bleeding from the iris. But later I hired a designer.

78
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,102
That's probably smartest thing I did at that point, and website looked

79
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:15,102
pretty good. Now why did that website or startup

80
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:19,230
failed? Well, after one and a half year we realized

81
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,882
we do not have any sorts of monetization plan.

82
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:26,462
So before you start working on a project or a startup,

83
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,858
figure out how you're going to make money. That's one of the things that's

84
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:33,746
pretty crazy to me today because for most of the Silicon Valley

85
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:37,334
companies, their business plan is we're going to get

86
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:40,758
zillion users, then we're going to get funding, then we're

87
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,554
going to got acquired. Myself, based on my lessons, I love

88
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:47,818
to get business plan early, see how I'm going to

89
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:51,882
monetize this project. It doesn't mean writing 50 pages of business plan,

90
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,942
but I need to know how this thing is going to make money and focus

91
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:58,414
on that. So with that in mind, I decided we should

92
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:02,254
start the second startup. Now we are all smarter and super good.

93
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:06,202
Same team and me. We decided we're going to make social

94
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:09,698
network because it was 2012 2015.

95
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:12,882
You can check on my LinkedIn profile. I do not remember the years,

96
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:17,102
but social network movie came up and our main investor

97
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:20,934
really wanted to make social network and we were

98
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:24,598
all very excited. Now since social network was very hype at the

99
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:28,150
moment, there was also another technology that was super

100
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,310
hyped and you know what? That was NoSQL.

101
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,938
Normally we started the project with MongoDB and everything

102
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:38,342
was super good because we were ready for a web scale.

103
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:41,854
Two years later, I did realize that majority of the code

104
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:45,370
I have written related to communication with database

105
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:49,146
was to turn it into relational database. So that's

106
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:52,746
my lesson to you. In 95% of the cases,

107
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:56,466
relational database is perfectly fine for you. You do not need to

108
00:06:56,488 --> 00:07:00,306
jump straight into NoSQL. And when you do, you need to know why are

109
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:04,590
you jumping into NoSQL database. Do not be afraid. Relational databases

110
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,226
are good. I can assure you I've been working with them after I learned

111
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:11,606
my lesson. The second lesson that I learned during that

112
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:15,430
whole trip is dont get hype driven. That second

113
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,710
startup was pretty amazing to multiple factors,

114
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,074
mostly because I learned how not to do things.

115
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,830
Our main investor, he loved having meetings

116
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,690
because those would inspire us. So every day we had

117
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,466
hour and a half meeting where we would listen to speeches

118
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,326
and get super inspired and get motivated to work

119
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:41,066
whole day. This is not me making fun of my clients.

120
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:45,342
This is me telling you how I failed to communicate

121
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:49,294
and manage that project. Today, I would not allow client

122
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:52,914
to hold that many unproductive meetings that had absolutely

123
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:56,434
no point. I would communicate better. At least I hope

124
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:59,926
I would communicate better to a client that his time can be spent in

125
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:03,734
much more productive way. At that point in time, I did not know how

126
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:07,494
to say no to the clients, because sometimes you need to say, this is not

127
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:11,146
working. Also, we worked on that project for a year and a

128
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:15,126
half before actually getting to our users. Now that's

129
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:18,394
another lesson that's very well done, because once

130
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:21,606
we release it, we release. Nobody's going to use this stuff.

131
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:24,954
And always talk to your users,

132
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:28,894
see if they want to use that crazy thing you're building. They may want

133
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:33,086
to, they may not want to, but talk to them because you

134
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:36,802
want to fail fast as possible. Less money spent and

135
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:40,786
more you can focus on something else. And another thing is talk

136
00:08:40,808 --> 00:08:44,658
to your team. I did not communicate very well with my team.

137
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:48,614
One time I decided to speak with each of the team members,

138
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:52,326
15 of us. And what happened is I just asked him a

139
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:56,514
simple stuff, what are we making? I got 15 different answers,

140
00:08:56,562 --> 00:09:00,330
myself included in those, they were not even the similar. Everybody thought

141
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,666
we were building the different thing. And I can assure you that product

142
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:08,442
looked absolutely schizophrenic and was

143
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:12,346
unusable. Now, after that, I started doing consulting

144
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:15,646
because it should be less stressful than developing your

145
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:19,210
own product. And I had plenty of python architecture skills.

146
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,166
I encountered some very interesting clients. Sometimes it

147
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,010
would be nontechnical client. Those are very difficult to work with

148
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,674
because what you need to do is establish the trust between

149
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:33,938
you and them. Basically assure them that you are

150
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:37,106
not trying to steal money from them and that you know how to do your

151
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:41,282
work. Almost all of the time you're going to be asked to send a proposal,

152
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:44,566
and that proposal is going to be beautiful. I know

153
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,862
that because I believe in each and one of you. You make

154
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:52,118
beautiful proposals. Client is going to go over 20 pages of that proposal.

155
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:55,866
It's going to ignore completely everything else. So what

156
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:59,686
I learned during that is that you need to talk with your clients before sending

157
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:04,074
them proposal to figure out what's important to them. Is it just the pricing?

158
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:07,274
Is it quality of the work? What are their biggest

159
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:11,354
fear? What problems are they trying to solve? Because sometimes clients

160
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,706
just want to try making something and sometimes the

161
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:18,606
project they're wanting to build actually requires bunch

162
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,794
of expertise from their side and is critical to their business.

163
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:25,506
You need to differentiate between those two. Based on that, you can

164
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:28,786
make your proposal. I can guarantee your proposal is going to

165
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,514
stand out once you've done your research and figure out what exactly client

166
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:35,686
wants, than if you just send them the proposal. If you just send them

167
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,314
the proposal, it's going to get ignored. Because if you got

168
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,034
your job or contract just based on the price, there's always

169
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:46,298
going to be somebody who can do it cheaper. Now,

170
00:10:46,464 --> 00:10:50,086
another anecdotes. One time we were building a simple

171
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:54,158
video player and client was pretty successful in his business,

172
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:57,262
decided to bring more innovation into

173
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:01,450
our product. So I asked him, okay, what sort of innovation?

174
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,634
He said, don't you think that majority of

175
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:09,090
players are just one dimensional? I said,

176
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,418
okay, what do you mean exactly? You can move

177
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:15,718
backwards and forward in the video. How about we make it

178
00:11:15,804 --> 00:11:19,446
three dimensional? Okay, so you

179
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:23,318
can go backwards and forwards in the video, up and down,

180
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:26,578
could handle the volume. And what's

181
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:30,090
the third dimension? You can go backwards and forwards.

182
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,374
So I thought to myself, what's the third dimension?

183
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:37,626
You can control videos. Would that be something else?

184
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:41,502
However, client had very much confidence into me and told me,

185
00:11:41,556 --> 00:11:45,854
you can figure it out. Now, I spent about

186
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:49,390
two weeks trying to figure but how to

187
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,226
create the player controls that would work in three dimensions.

188
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,642
And when I figured something out, I talked with clients and he already

189
00:11:56,696 --> 00:12:00,226
forgot. So don't be afraid to

190
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:03,682
tell clients that they can be a bit crazy or let

191
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,600
idea slip for a bit, because that can happen.

192
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,246
Now, the most interesting type of clients that

193
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:14,390
I encounter are clients that have friends that

194
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,654
know something. Basically, they would

195
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:21,034
get friends to tell them what's good or not. In my

196
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:24,634
case, since I love doing things with Python, I would make

197
00:12:24,672 --> 00:12:28,426
a proposal for writing entire website in Python because I

198
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,962
know that stuff. The client would ask their friend and they would tell me,

199
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:35,518
yeah, but their friend says they're using Java in their company,

200
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:39,166
so Python is no good. And I was like, okay, but you can write website

201
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:42,410
in. No, no, they're not using Python.

202
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:45,886
Well then you need to find, no, no, no, we want

203
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:49,346
you to write in Java. So after back and forth asked to

204
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,994
speak with their friend and they told me, yeah, you can write stuff

205
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:56,854
in Python as well. Sometimes it

206
00:12:56,892 --> 00:13:00,706
pays to talk to the friends of the clients that are giving them awesome advice.

207
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:04,294
Sometimes it just pays to pass on the

208
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:08,166
project. And one anecdote that every designer is going to

209
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:12,054
tell you is the moment when their client's child told them that a logo

210
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:15,306
design is not nice and they need to change it.

211
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:19,194
Luckily, since I'm backend developer, nobody ever gave me

212
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:23,142
a compliment and told me, oh my gosh, your backend code

213
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:26,558
is so beautiful. Most of the time what they tell me is,

214
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:30,030
okay, it's working or it's not working, fix it right away.

215
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,046
So that's what I do. Ash, I'm sure most of you have come to

216
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:37,438
hear the story about nuclear silo and Python development.

217
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:40,446
Well, at the peak of 218,

218
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:43,666
when blockchain was all decraised as it is now,

219
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:47,326
client decided to create a new blockchain and they invested

220
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:50,614
a bunch of money into that blockchain. So one time,

221
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:54,470
since I was a contractor and I was the most expendable person

222
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,734
on the team, but sadly, I was the only person

223
00:13:57,852 --> 00:14:01,194
who knew the entire back end because I built it. I was

224
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:04,746
also the person who could not be easily fired. So they put me

225
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:08,422
as a sacrificial lamp to hear an idea from the CEO

226
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:11,706
because nobody else could say no to him because they would

227
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:15,038
get fired. I said, okay, I know something crazy is going

228
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:18,394
to happen, but let's hear it. CEO starts telling

229
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,566
me, okay, since we are developing this blockchain and

230
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:24,802
it's going to got super popular, what we should do

231
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:28,354
is basically buy a nuclear silo and

232
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:32,834
put our servers there move everything from AWS to

233
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,822
nuclear silo, and that's going to be super secure.

234
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:39,990
And I was thinking back a little, because my first question

235
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,870
is, you can buy nuclear silos.

236
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,710
To which my response I got,

237
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,374
yes, they're selling decommissioned nuclear silo for

238
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:53,946
just 800,000. For me, that's a super good

239
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:57,770
deal. I don't have that kind of money, but if I ever wanted to buy

240
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,558
decommissioned nuclear silo, that's a super good price. So I

241
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:05,406
tried to explain to a client that that's not how computer security

242
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:09,150
works. AWS has a good security system.

243
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,946
You just need to configure it. And we had a bunch of back and

244
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:16,654
forth, and then I realized I'm using technical language.

245
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:20,894
So I explained to him that using nuclear

246
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:24,562
silos to secure your blockchain servers is the same thing

247
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:28,438
as buying a dog and putting it next to your computer

248
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:31,638
to ward off the hackers. And that worked.

249
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:35,634
That metaphor solved everything. We did not buy the nuclear silo,

250
00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:39,974
which is super sad because I cool have worked on nuclear silo

251
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,942
project, but can't have everything. And what he didn't

252
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:48,266
mention that meeting, which I probably should, is that security

253
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,334
and nuclear silos were not the biggest problem on that project.

254
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,758
Problem was that nobody was using that blockchain. It was

255
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:59,278
pretty much useless. So, lesson for everybody.

256
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:02,554
Focus on project market fit, get some users,

257
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:05,890
then try to solve problems in that area.

258
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,874
And another client wanted us to write a file system

259
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:13,346
for a website that was basically a marketplace. And I

260
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:16,114
asked him why, and he said, well,

261
00:16:16,232 --> 00:16:19,826
Google and Facebook, they all have proprietary technology. So that's

262
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:23,798
AWS. We should have our own proprietary technology. So let's write everything

263
00:16:23,884 --> 00:16:27,046
from the start. When client asks you something like that,

264
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:30,854
then you know you're going to lose a bunch of times.

265
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:34,554
So what they did is just make an estimate how much it would

266
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:37,594
cost to reinvent a file system,

267
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:41,026
how much it would cost to rewrite entire database

268
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:44,862
from zero and stuff like that. And he realized that for

269
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,894
his $10,000 web store, he did not need custom

270
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,366
file system and database, and all was good.

271
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:56,514
One thing I realized pretty quickly is that I have no

272
00:16:56,552 --> 00:17:00,450
idea how to do design. Because this goes way back

273
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,002
into the time when I thought I actually can do design.

274
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:07,346
Now, I'm not sure if you remember, but in the time of dial

275
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:10,758
up days, Flash was all the craze. So I created a

276
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:14,482
website that had five megabytes of Flash file

277
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:18,166
that was always playing music and animation on a web page.

278
00:17:18,268 --> 00:17:21,834
And you could not stop that music. And I was super impressed because I was

279
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:25,530
16 and that was my first website. What was crazy

280
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,190
to me is while I was getting so little visitors,

281
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:32,726
oh my gosh, this works super fast on my local machine,

282
00:17:32,838 --> 00:17:36,286
but when I tried to visit it from my friend's house, it turns out it

283
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:40,046
takes 20 minutes to load it up. Yeah,

284
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:43,342
I would like to say that I learned the lesson, but as you already

285
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,946
know me, I did not. I just left that website

286
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:50,494
because fault was my friend's computer, not his Internet

287
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:54,066
connection, so it was just him. I did try to find that website

288
00:17:54,168 --> 00:17:57,446
several years ago, but it's gone. Probably for the

289
00:17:57,468 --> 00:18:01,606
best. Also, one of the good things I learned is that

290
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,334
I have no idea how front end works because

291
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:09,774
in the olden days before the Javascript alien had a debugger,

292
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,866
all the synchronous stuff, all the craziness that was happening there.

293
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,466
Internet explorer six, that's all I'm going to say. That was

294
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:21,546
super crazy to me because I love deterministic behavior as

295
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:25,262
people say. I don't hate front end, some of my best

296
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:28,574
friends do front end and my younger brother, he does front end

297
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,774
and he's super good and he writes tests for

298
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:35,202
front end. I'm probably only thing I can write

299
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:38,030
in front end is background red in CSS.

300
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,770
So learn your limitations.

301
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,538
Learn what you want to do and what you don't want to do. Because at

302
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:49,570
the end of the day at this job, you're going to be working it hopefully

303
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,286
just 8 hours per day. And spending all that time on something you

304
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:56,566
do not like and do not enjoy is not worth it in the end.

305
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,838
Also, let's see, I probably have some bunch of cool anecdotes.

306
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:04,554
Oh yeah. When I had a cool idea about got having a

307
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:08,362
set work time, like when I said to my team, you know,

308
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,250
we are super organized and we were all junior developers,

309
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,622
we can work as much as we want as long as we finish

310
00:19:16,676 --> 00:19:20,266
our tasks. So if you want to work 2 hours per day it's perfectly

311
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:23,250
fine. If you don't want to work Monday or stuff like that,

312
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,502
perfectly fine. What happened was utter chaos

313
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:31,234
because fronted was waiting on design, back end was

314
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:35,170
working on something that was obsolete and stuff like that.

315
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,486
What happened after that is at one point I realized we were

316
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:41,974
working 14 12 hours per day. I don't know if you ever

317
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:45,094
done that, but that's soul crushing to say

318
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:48,742
the least. So after that I went back to hang regular hours.

319
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:52,598
It worked fine. Like you don't need to reinvent the wheel.

320
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:56,166
I'm hoping you can get it below 40 hours because I'm

321
00:19:56,198 --> 00:20:00,250
going to say this on the programming conference, but personal life

322
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,546
is more important than your programming skills.

323
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:08,014
I spent last decade programming, and most of the stuff I remember happened

324
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:12,458
outside of programming. You deserve to have a life. Yeah, life tip

325
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:15,774
and I think that's all the wisdom I have to show

326
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:19,358
for at the moment. What I would like to do is had something

327
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:23,502
super crazy and super amazing happen to you. Please share

328
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:27,078
with me. You can reach me on LinkedIn. There's probably going to be

329
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:31,074
link in the description or somewhere else. I also love having virtual

330
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:35,174
coffee with people. I met all sorts of amazing people on

331
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:38,598
Internet. So unlike what most people tell you,

332
00:20:38,684 --> 00:20:42,422
Internet is full of nice people. Thank you very much for listening my talk.

333
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:43,830
I hope you enjoy it.
