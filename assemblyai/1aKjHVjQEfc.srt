00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,746
You. Hello everyone,

2
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:49,394
my name is Susiesu. Welcome to my today's talk on the

3
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:52,482
transformation of diverse and information security

4
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:55,730
in AIoT. Before we just

5
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,710
start our today's session, I would like to express my gratitude

6
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,618
to the 42 for inviting me

7
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:07,140
to be here and meet all of you. Let's just begin.

8
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,866
Here is quick introduction about myself I'm currently

9
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:16,022
working as a DevOps manager and a software operations architect

10
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:20,174
at signify formerly Philips lighting three years

11
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:23,694
ago I have actively dubbed into

12
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:26,670
AI and machine learning et cetera,

13
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,774
which is the reason why I'm here. Look at the

14
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:35,362
lecture side. In our tech industry we

15
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,370
strive to contribute to open source a lot.

16
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,854
So if you would like you can scan this QR

17
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:46,002
code provided and you can gain my articles,

18
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:49,942
tech events and speeches and also

19
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:53,894
my upcoming books. The first we will

20
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:57,830
talk about what does Iot mean AIoT?

21
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,822
So actually it's just a new term. It means artificial intelligence

22
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:07,066
in IoT. For example like automated vehicles like

23
00:03:07,168 --> 00:03:10,906
Tesla, gilmore, et cetera. And for example like

24
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:14,686
smart cities. Our company's lighting is a

25
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:18,602
leader industry and also the radio surveillance,

26
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:22,234
monitoring traffic and smart buildings for

27
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:26,610
the manufacturing. Like we take advantage like deep learning and

28
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,890
deep neural networks for production line to

29
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,730
do this kind of quality checks.

30
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,542
As I said, my strength is

31
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:41,382
in Iot lighting industry. So I take the

32
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:44,950
relevant for example so let's

33
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,510
imagine I visited the Black Forest recently

34
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,654
and I captured a photo at the right side illustrative.

35
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:57,446
Now I'd like to recreate the same ambience

36
00:03:57,558 --> 00:04:01,262
in my bedroom. Can AI achieve it?

37
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:05,134
The answer is yes. So first I got

38
00:04:05,172 --> 00:04:08,574
this photo, black Forest photo and we

39
00:04:08,612 --> 00:04:12,518
need to have some conversion from image

40
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:16,482
to the test all to some parameters that

41
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:20,334
hardware can recognize. So far, definitely we can achieve

42
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:24,414
it. For example, a couple of weeks ago OpenAI launched

43
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:27,234
one of the six features.

44
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:31,094
One of this is dell e three and it

45
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:34,662
can support this function very well. And then

46
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:40,078
we will just upload this letter

47
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:43,526
e three to convert

48
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:47,434
to process this photo image to the

49
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:51,114
text related to these lighting parameters

50
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:55,354
that hardware can recognize. Then send the command to hardware

51
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:59,934
like hardware processing. Finally we applied it

52
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:03,374
become this. It's quite astonishing,

53
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:06,770
right? Go ahead. So second

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,482
part we will discuss how AI and

55
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:13,854
AIot affect our DevOps roles.

56
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:18,100
I believe most of you, you are maybe either

57
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,866
DevOps engineers. Let's go ahead. So what's

58
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:26,710
the current AI capabilities? I have to tell you

59
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,074
so far I provided the data here is quite

60
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:33,962
a little bit old because I got it a couple

61
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,974
of months ago and two weeks ago operations

62
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:41,310
on the OpenAI's dive days, they launched the six

63
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,766
features and the new data, new knowledge and

64
00:05:44,788 --> 00:05:47,710
a new function and a new modalities.

65
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,294
IoT dramatically challenges the current AI capabilities.

66
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:56,062
We definitely need to jump into what I say, the AGI

67
00:05:56,126 --> 00:06:00,130
era. What does that mean? Is artificial general intelligence

68
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,242
era. As open

69
00:06:04,296 --> 00:06:06,150
AI CEO simside,

70
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,146
he just defined AGI as a kind of median

71
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:16,118
human can lets your work

72
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:19,610
effectively as a coworker. So return

73
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,354
to this topic. Yeah, definitely. In the future or in

74
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:27,210
the very coming future, the AI capability will

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,182
increase twice or three times than current data.

76
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:35,214
I shared. So what's the current data? So AI is

77
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:38,602
equal to a Google level three software

78
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:43,118
engineer. If you're not familiar with Google's salary hierarchy,

79
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:47,300
here it is. So for the level three

80
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,706
Google's software engineer, they can earn like

81
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:56,134
around two hundred k dollars per

82
00:06:56,172 --> 00:06:59,880
year. And it can be replaced right now.

83
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,510
And AI is also equal to a

84
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,442
qualified Stanford students. You think maybe just a yin

85
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:11,466
major? No, it's a yin. 16 units seem like

86
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:15,926
16 majors. It's really super intelligent

87
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:17,980
Stanford students, right?

88
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,302
Actually over the decade we have a lot of

89
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:26,254
discussion about AI. AI actually is

90
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:29,662
not a new term, but did you realize this

91
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,300
year AI become very popular and

92
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:41,170
what I say is kind of prominent any

93
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,340
time in the past years? As I said,

94
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,374
the answer is we are definitely into the

95
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:52,438
AGI era. So what does it mean actually?

96
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:56,050
OpenAI's GBT four turbo, the recent

97
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,274
model, the recent API actually can

98
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:05,082
just bridge the gap between human common sense

99
00:08:05,216 --> 00:08:09,434
and AI capabilities. So over ten

100
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:12,502
years ago, we had a prediction about AI.

101
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:16,002
Yes, it's all about like telemarketers,

102
00:08:16,086 --> 00:08:20,074
they can be replaced easily. And also bookkeeping

103
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:23,354
clubs and the competition and the benefits managers,

104
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,714
et cetera, or receptionist. But actually

105
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:32,190
this year, after we jump into the AGI era,

106
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:38,658
things changed. Here is some statistics,

107
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:41,926
data from very official website.

108
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:45,554
Here are the ten roles that AI is most likely

109
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:50,182
to replace. Unfortunately, I have to tell you, in tech jobs,

110
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:54,966
for example, like coders, software engineers, data analysts,

111
00:08:55,158 --> 00:08:59,398
their job can be replaced by AI easily.

112
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:03,562
And also media jobs. Do you remember this protest?

113
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:07,706
Like Hariwun, they have contender

114
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:12,642
creations. Protest for protecting their

115
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:16,302
ip, right? And also the legal industry

116
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:20,318
jobs. For example like paralegals, legal assistants,

117
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:24,222
our market research analysis, also teachers,

118
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:28,658
and also finance jobs like financial analysis

119
00:09:28,754 --> 00:09:32,930
and financial advisors. And also like stock

120
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,890
traders, graphic designers,

121
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,930
accountants, customer service agents. But for

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,410
our DevOps, we will focus on software engineers.

123
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,570
Now you may feel oh very worried about our

124
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,270
role, our job. But what AI cannot do

125
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,966
here it is. So AI cannot do a lot of things.

126
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:59,566
But I will focus on these four parts. So first,

127
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:03,390
AI is incapable of handling intricate

128
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,870
problems. We are in the reality.

129
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,882
So the real world case is not like one

130
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:16,630
plus one equals two. It's very complex. For example,

131
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,710
especially like big firms,

132
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,882
developers consistently encounter real world open ended

133
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:27,138
questions and challenges. Big firms, they are a

134
00:10:27,164 --> 00:10:30,858
Iot of departments. For each department they have

135
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:35,450
a different perspective. And when they

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,610
work together to achieve the same goal. And also

137
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,310
there is an old business and focus on like a migration.

138
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,378
We always encounter this kind of situation like a operations,

139
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:52,186
because we know if it's completely new, we can do

140
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:55,634
it easily. But for migration, we need to

141
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:59,074
keep the zero down time for the

142
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:03,380
running business, for these kind of intricate problems.

143
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,590
So far AI cannot do it because it means

144
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,790
the kind of multi departments,

145
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,374
cooperations and also very little

146
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:18,330
things, not just only related to technology, it's also

147
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,214
related to the models, the business models

148
00:11:22,262 --> 00:11:24,540
for our customers business.

149
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,474
What should I say is a kind of interpersonal skills, something like

150
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:34,826
that. The second part is AI lacks the depth

151
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:37,760
of thought. For example, like I mentioned,

152
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,974
AI current capability can replace the

153
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:46,882
level three Google engineers. But how about the level four level,

154
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:50,722
the top one? I think everyone just

155
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,966
know actually as DevOps.

156
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,702
So we are not just only focused on the development, we focus

157
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:01,558
on the operations as well. I forgot who said it.

158
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:05,062
DevOps is similar like a philosopher. It's not just

159
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:08,554
one piece of technology. They must know the

160
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:12,010
whole picture over the

161
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,234
entire lifecycle of a business, from the

162
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:20,400
human communications and also the

163
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,170
technologies like development operations,

164
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,350
Linux and networking, et cetera, et cetera

165
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,442
and so on, a lot of things. And when it comes together,

166
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:36,306
it's really difficult to be replaced by

167
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:40,114
AI because AI cannot do this depths of

168
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:43,950
thought. For example, like the top Google engineer,

169
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,870
they are kind of the master in our tech industry.

170
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,958
They are the person, what I say is kind of

171
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:55,526
a game maker. And they are the person to make

172
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:59,194
this role. Yeah right. And also the third

173
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:02,918
one, AI is deficient in critical thinking capabilities.

174
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:07,014
As I mentioned, there is six features

175
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:11,310
has been launched on the dev day of OpenAI.

176
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,278
One of it is modalities and IoT means

177
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:19,150
in the future, and OpenAI also maybe

178
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,086
other AI companies, they will launch

179
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,398
more and more sophisticated models.

180
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:30,178
So it means it will affect our daily life,

181
00:13:30,264 --> 00:13:34,446
it affect enormous range

182
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:38,146
of fields. But about

183
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:42,302
this thinking model, we will be the person to choose is

184
00:13:42,376 --> 00:13:46,022
what I like. It's not what I like. If I need to

185
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,866
focus on we questions. It's not my thinking model, it's not my

186
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:53,450
belongs to my personality. I'm the person I question

187
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,290
this, it cannot nurture

188
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:01,262
myself thinking model. Because we as

189
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:04,240
a human, we have our personal thinking model.

190
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,958
So what should I say is

191
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:12,306
one of the most important capabilities we needed

192
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:15,714
to focus on? I mean, critical thinking, it means

193
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:19,198
we cannot replace by AI.

194
00:14:19,374 --> 00:14:23,186
And I could say critical thinking is kind of

195
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,550
for one difference between human and AI.

196
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,246
And also the fourth one, AI strategies to

197
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:34,146
engage in real world collaborations and communication,

198
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:37,622
cross various departments and teams, right? For example,

199
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:41,162
like a software skills, communication should be fine.

200
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:45,050
But how about interpersonal skills?

201
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,802
They didn't know how we feel. Even we use these

202
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:53,786
words, right? But related to the kind

203
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:58,170
of humans words or even their innation,

204
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,606
it's really complicated. It's not like if it's

205
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:06,258
just a machine, just because of your test, can understand

206
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:10,014
what you really mean. So it's kind of interpersonal skills.

207
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:13,806
AI cannot do. It also like leadership

208
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,710
and being the influencer to affect

209
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,074
others and problem solving. Yeah, this AI

210
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:24,838
may be helpful, you know, for the

211
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,646
entire intricate problems, they cannot

212
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,310
do it. And also like teamwork.

213
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,458
And for example, like maintaining the work ethic this

214
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:41,150
AI cannot do. We mentioned the

215
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,102
AIoT and also how affect our dev

216
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:48,960
throws. But then the third one is AI security.

217
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,126
Actually, you know, definitely in

218
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:57,954
principle, not for

219
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:01,458
in IoT industry. For example, like a software attack

220
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,366
by AI, it will just let your

221
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,694
website go down, right? Or maybe you

222
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:13,314
got some financial losses. But if AI hacked

223
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:17,362
IoT industry is so horrible, it means

224
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:21,046
it will kill someone. It will affect

225
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:25,082
individuals directly. Let's focus on the

226
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:28,826
IoT industry first. As I

227
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:32,762
said, AI is not new term so far. It becomes

228
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:37,562
very prevalent just because the GPT

229
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:41,454
four has been released in

230
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:45,474
March 2023. But actually this term has

231
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:48,558
been coined in 1956. So it's

232
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,890
almost 70 years ago. What I mean is

233
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,258
AI security, it will grow up gradually,

234
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:59,126
not just so far. I give you the AI security scopes, but it

235
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,502
definitely is coming very soon. It will be

236
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:05,862
expanded, but we can learn from

237
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,306
the traditional classification related to security, right?

238
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:13,014
For example, the right side is the diagram

239
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:16,220
I drawed. And here you will see

240
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,646
information security include cybersecurity

241
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,640
and cybersecurity and

242
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,634
it security. They have overlap. It belongs

243
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:32,160
to network security. Let's go ahead.

244
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,082
Cybersecurity and is IoT just here.

245
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:38,994
So network security, cloud security,

246
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:42,670
endpoint security, application security, then Iot

247
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,370
security. So we will extend

248
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,654
this part a lot because as I mentioned,

249
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:53,094
Iot security we must focus on very

250
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,846
much. It will affect our lives.

251
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:59,994
IoT will affect the safety of the

252
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:03,580
city, the entire country or the entire world.

253
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,310
So Iot security related to for example like 5g networks

254
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,518
related to IoT, like Internet of vehicles

255
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:16,090
Iot industrial, industrial Iot.

256
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,786
So IoT looks like the right side is ICI is a separate

257
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:23,140
incident timeline. It's a real case,

258
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,690
some real case happened over the past thousand

259
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,140
years, 100 years. Sorry.

260
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,718
So first for example since the 1903

261
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:41,286
let's take one for example. So 212

262
00:18:41,388 --> 00:18:45,442
there is campaign it's about the guys pipeline

263
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:49,350
cyber attack. So for example like synclates pipeline.

264
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,598
And also think about a nuclear industry.

265
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:56,778
If IoT has been attacked by AI, IoT means

266
00:18:56,864 --> 00:19:00,250
not just one person or a few operations,

267
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:05,150
they will die but it will dramatically

268
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,150
erupt and destroy this entire city

269
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,138
or the entire country. So horrible, right?

270
00:19:12,324 --> 00:19:15,442
So is the reason why we must focus on the

271
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:19,678
AI security, especially the Iot industry.

272
00:19:19,854 --> 00:19:23,538
So here is AI security based on my

273
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,618
personal ten years cyber security expert

274
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:31,206
I defined this with my three years

275
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:34,754
working experience in AI. So let's

276
00:19:34,802 --> 00:19:38,454
just have a look go through the whole one,

277
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:42,518
two, three. The AI security because

278
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:46,458
it's dramatically, not dramatically, it's kind of very

279
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:49,858
different from the traditional security scopes.

280
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:54,282
So first let's go to the data security. So protects

281
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:58,350
AI data confidentially and integrity and availability

282
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,954
and uses encryption and access controls

283
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:06,430
to secure data storage and also anonymize

284
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,802
the data to prevent lets. For example here

285
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:14,354
is quite a new feature because take

286
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:17,654
one for example like JBT. We have interaction with

287
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:21,986
JBT, we send a question but this kind of question doesn't

288
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:25,462
view related to our real life or

289
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,418
is something related to our privacy.

290
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:33,014
And when we nominate it even you have intact it's

291
00:20:33,142 --> 00:20:36,700
nothing. Yeah, Iot won't be a big deal for us.

292
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,890
And the second privacy preservation.

293
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,894
So what it can do to

294
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:48,766
protect this privacy preservation. So for example like

295
00:20:48,868 --> 00:20:52,654
differentiate privacy in

296
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:56,162
compresses like methods we introduce manage

297
00:20:56,216 --> 00:20:59,998
the disturbance or other noises

298
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:04,180
into this data to safeguard individual privacy without

299
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,678
compromising the general usableness of data.

300
00:21:08,764 --> 00:21:11,890
So even it has been all hacked or et cetera,

301
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,862
we do not know. We got some noises we

302
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,974
cannot get the general useful of the data.

303
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:23,322
And Saturday the learning allows for the

304
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:27,286
spreading the training procedure over various devices

305
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:30,606
to prevent the disclosure of raw data,

306
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:34,382
right? And the

307
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:37,886
third one is traditional one information security like

308
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:41,418
application cloud infrastructure,

309
00:21:41,514 --> 00:21:43,330
incident response,

310
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,486
cryptography and disaster

311
00:21:47,518 --> 00:21:50,210
recovery, vulnerability management.

312
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,646
All types of information security we need to focus on in AI,

313
00:21:55,758 --> 00:22:00,158
right? And explainability and transparency

314
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:04,678
is also very important one for AI security because

315
00:22:04,764 --> 00:22:08,078
it can identify vulnerabilities and understanding

316
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:11,334
how decisions are made and the transparent

317
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:15,450
models are easy to audit to debug. For us,

318
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,762
we are the human but IoT is just a machine. We give

319
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:22,206
the data no matter what kind of

320
00:22:22,228 --> 00:22:23,920
things. We need some,

321
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:29,342
it can be explainability and also

322
00:22:29,396 --> 00:22:33,726
transparent. Otherwise we do not know the machine will go which kind of a direction.

323
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:37,842
Maybe it's a disaster, but we even didn't know it because

324
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:40,802
it dramatically not transparent for us,

325
00:22:40,856 --> 00:22:44,226
right. And then the IoT security,

326
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:48,274
like we have failed networks, like the

327
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:52,070
self driving and the IoT, we definitely

328
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,902
do not want the AI attacked us,

329
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,906
right? What I

330
00:22:58,928 --> 00:23:01,210
say is so terrible.

331
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:05,926
And human AI interaction security, like protecting

332
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:10,290
user data, preventing the impersonation attacks,

333
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,538
ensuring that AI generated outputs are not exploited

334
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:16,510
by malicious purpose.

335
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,034
Yeah. For example, we have the interaction and with Chinatip,

336
00:23:23,162 --> 00:23:26,498
with some model learning model

337
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:30,734
and we are focusing, we are just younger,

338
00:23:30,862 --> 00:23:35,494
very real teenager or these

339
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:38,710
kind of things, if they have been attacked,

340
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:43,030
okay. And IoT has been exploited by

341
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,834
malicious purpose. Wow, it's really horrible.

342
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:50,970
It can train our children, our next

343
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,210
generation, or even for us to kind of nurture

344
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,954
your religion or something affect

345
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:04,862
your culture and to influence you

346
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:08,970
to do something very bad. Oh, it is so horrible.

347
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,582
And then it's also special when in AI,

348
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:16,018
because as I mentioned, there are a

349
00:24:16,024 --> 00:24:19,730
lot of modalities, like models, so many models

350
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,634
so far in reality. And also in the future there are more and

351
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:27,334
more models will be launched. So what

352
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:30,838
we can do to protect this model security. It's the

353
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:33,240
close things for AI security,

354
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:38,598
because AI is kind of a set of various

355
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:43,530
models. And so first, as adversarial

356
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,974
perturbations, like malicious impose craft

357
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:52,430
to deceive AI models into making incorrect

358
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:58,254
predictions. Also the transfer attacks like

359
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,518
reversal text that work across

360
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:05,474
different AI models. For example, like red box, the black

361
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:09,886
box attacks, which depend on attackers knowledge of the target,

362
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,140
like model's architecture. For example,

363
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,006
if your model, for example,

364
00:25:18,108 --> 00:25:21,494
like a business prediction model has been attacked by your

365
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:25,170
competitors, and you just generated,

366
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,794
and AI just generated a laser prediction that you go this

367
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,442
way, but dramatically wrong, maybe just after

368
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:35,500
two years you just realize, wow,

369
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,714
it's completely wrong prediction. But you already to

370
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:44,560
plays everything there. You contribute to your business,

371
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,034
you cost the money for everything. But it's so horrible,

372
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,340
right? Bias and fairness security.

373
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:59,842
We are human around the world and

374
00:25:59,896 --> 00:26:04,370
with different cultures, different civilizations, different religions.

375
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,866
It's so difficult in our

376
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:13,174
daily life to do our best to mitigate a bias for

377
00:26:13,212 --> 00:26:16,342
this machine. Of course, they didn't know what

378
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:19,542
is bias. So we definitely need to this

379
00:26:19,596 --> 00:26:23,618
technology techniques to identify and to reduce the

380
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:26,778
bias in training data is what we view.

381
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:30,022
Streamlining this machine and also fairness

382
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:33,226
aware learning, so created to design models

383
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:37,866
that make fair predictions across different demographic groups,

384
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:42,190
different cultures, and then lifecycle

385
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,514
security. AI is not like,

386
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:49,886
oh, we just invent some software.

387
00:26:49,998 --> 00:26:53,650
We developed our software, one day we just

388
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,818
terminate, we do not use it anymore, leave it.

389
00:26:56,984 --> 00:27:00,642
But AI model or AI

390
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:04,134
stuff, you cannot just like we

391
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:07,874
started coding practices and

392
00:27:07,932 --> 00:27:11,926
regular updates. But how about when you will determine

393
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:15,340
this project, you must make sure everything

394
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,570
proper disposal of these systems,

395
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,994
you end this project and determinate

396
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:29,402
this project. It should be fine. But if something ongoing,

397
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:33,854
we must make everything sure we have the lifecycle,

398
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:37,842
we make sure everything know

399
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:41,250
what's the matter. Stipend the regular updates,

400
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,980
that's quite most important part.

401
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:50,290
And then regulation

402
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,150
or regulatory compliance.

403
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,400
If we just rely on the AI firms itself

404
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,650
to be warm heart, to be a good heart to

405
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,122
help the technology go the right

406
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:10,418
direction is ridiculous.

407
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:14,922
We cannot rely on them. We need involved

408
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:18,574
in what I say, the regulations and

409
00:28:18,612 --> 00:28:22,374
also the legislations, for example like data protection

410
00:28:22,442 --> 00:28:26,350
laws, GDPR or industry specific regulations

411
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,380
and icicle guidelines. Right.

412
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:36,226
And it's the last one. But last, but not the

413
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:39,570
last one. But I don't think Iot will be the last one.

414
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,618
Definitely in the near future it will be extended human

415
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:47,818
in the loop, because if there is no human view

416
00:28:47,984 --> 00:28:51,738
like white box, black box,

417
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:56,122
we don't know what is the machine will go, will the machine will go

418
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:59,874
which direction or the machine has been attacked.

419
00:29:00,022 --> 00:29:03,502
The machine got some threat detection, but we must

420
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:07,498
have some human expertise with the AI analysis

421
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:11,054
for this threat detection. And also be

422
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:13,806
curious and be cautious.

423
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:16,020
No matter how we call us.

424
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,510
It's not wrong, honestly. We need to have this overall

425
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,382
human oversight. So we have

426
00:29:24,536 --> 00:29:28,614
discussed the alt definition and I also give

427
00:29:28,652 --> 00:29:32,070
you the lighting application example in reality.

428
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,170
And also I have shared how AI and alt

429
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:40,694
affect our DevOps roles and what we can do,

430
00:29:40,732 --> 00:29:44,682
what I can do and what AI cannot do. We will focus

431
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:48,140
on this one. And then the last

432
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,798
but not the least, we have a discussion about

433
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:55,978
the information security, the traditional classifications,

434
00:29:56,074 --> 00:29:59,600
and also we focus on the IoT security. Definitely.

435
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,174
I give you the new definitions

436
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,810
and also the scopes, different scopes of AI security

437
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,762
we need to focus on. Yeah. So here

438
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:14,980
IoT is. So I hope all of you

439
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,018
can get a little bit inspiration from my today's talk

440
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:23,490
and anything practical you gained.

441
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,922
I will feel really grateful and

442
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:29,240
you enjoy today's talk. Thank you.
