1
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,850
This is security implications of quantum

2
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,990
computing. A little bit of introduction

3
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,854
since we've got

4
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:34,534
it here. Let me see. I've got get the

5
00:00:34,572 --> 00:00:37,560
chat and see if I can do that. No.

6
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,900
Okay. I'll have to pick it up.

7
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,620
Where are we here?

8
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,300
There we go.

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,074
Okay. There's the details

10
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:59,934
in the chat screen if you want

11
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:03,634
to do pick up those things.

12
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:07,822
But anyways, that's sort of the introduction

13
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:11,842
to a set of blog postings that I did some

14
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,820
years back. That was five years ago,

15
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,830
so that's got a little extra detail and

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,160
introduction to what this is doing,

17
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,770
because quantum computing. Well, quantum mechanics,

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,186
I think it was Niels Bohr who said that anybody who

19
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,660
thinks they understand it and their brain doesn't hurt, doesn't understand.

20
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,120
You know, quantum computing is really

21
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,160
interesting stuff. We definitely do not have

22
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,690
an awful lot of an idea of what it really

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,154
means, but in terms of not

24
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:04,302
to get into the quantum physics

25
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:09,202
and quantum mechanics stuff, but flowing

26
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:13,174
out of the basic concepts there,

27
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:16,854
we have the idea of the

28
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:21,370
qubit. Now, we have bits in computers.

29
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,074
We deal with bits. Quantum computers deal

30
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:31,566
with qubits. And a

31
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,840
bit is either a one or a zero.

32
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,414
A qubit can be one and zero

33
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:41,598
at the same time until

34
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:45,982
we determine what it's ultimately

35
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:50,158
going to be. The determination

36
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,610
is what goes into quantum programming.

37
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,814
This gets a little bit hairy because it can not only be

38
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:03,446
one and zero at the same time, but any value in

39
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:07,654
between in certain situations. So we

40
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:11,322
won't get into that right now. We'll just say that it can be one

41
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,874
and zero at the same time. What this allows us to

42
00:03:14,912 --> 00:03:18,954
do with sufficiently many qubits is to

43
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:22,942
set up a situation where we can run

44
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:26,494
through all possible values at the same time and find out

45
00:03:26,532 --> 00:03:27,760
which ones fit.

46
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,780
That's basically what we talk about.

47
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,438
We have all kinds of weird things about quantum mechanics

48
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:43,890
and quantum computing.

49
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,340
There's the observer effect.

50
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,302
Schrodinger's cat is both alive and dead at the same time,

51
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:54,646
and Schrodinger's phone, until you look, it's both

52
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,320
cracked and not cracked at the same time,

53
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,690
and stuff like that. But there's also an issue

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,340
called entanglement, and we're going to touch on that

55
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,770
slightly in one of these things in terms of networking.

56
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,146
But the entanglement of multiple qubits

57
00:04:15,258 --> 00:04:19,166
is what gives us the opportunity to perform the

58
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:22,606
same function on a bunch of qubits. And again, as I say, sort of

59
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:26,114
find out which answer it is that actually fits with

60
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:29,746
one operation. And here's the bore quote that I has saying if

61
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:34,094
someone says that he can think or talk about quantum physics without becoming

62
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:37,590
dizzy, that shows only that he has not understood anything whatever

63
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,694
about it. So we'll do that.

64
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:45,270
Now, one of the aspects of quantum technology

65
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,634
with computers is that we

66
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:54,822
can have quantum

67
00:04:54,886 --> 00:04:58,166
technology to aid

68
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,710
us in producing traditional computers.

69
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,382
So we're making chips and

70
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:10,094
elements on the chips smaller and faster, and we're getting

71
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:14,510
into the quantum size range, where there are quantum effects

72
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,854
in what we're doing with chips and traces,

73
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:22,258
and that sort of know

74
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:24,340
we need to address that.

75
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,326
There's also the fact that one

76
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:35,526
of the things that Turing figured out with his

77
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,954
ideas of computing, starting us all off here,

78
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:42,406
is that irreversible computations,

79
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:48,490
that's in traditional computers, they have

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,938
a sort of a minimum limit. We're reaching

81
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:56,606
the limits in terms of how much we

82
00:05:56,628 --> 00:06:01,034
can reduce the power consumption with traditional computers.

83
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:04,482
But with quantum operations, we can do

84
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,874
reversible computations, and in

85
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:11,460
that case, you can make the power arbitrarily small.

86
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,622
Again, we can build a traditional computer with very

87
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:21,606
low power consumption if we're using

88
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:23,990
quantum technology properly.

89
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,566
There's quantum cryptography, and quantum

90
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,214
cryptography is a real thing, but it keeps on getting mixed

91
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:37,862
up with the idea of using quantum

92
00:06:37,926 --> 00:06:41,834
computers for decryption, a sort of a universal

93
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:44,798
decryption. And people are saying, oh,

94
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:48,494
quantum computers are going to kill. Cryptography has. We know it,

95
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:51,998
and that is not the case, and we'll talk about that

96
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:55,758
in a second here. But quantum cryptography,

97
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:59,314
I do want to mention and disentangle it from

98
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,914
this quantum decryption thing. Quantum cryptography is

99
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:08,118
not cryptography. It is basically

100
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:12,358
just key exchange. And I have

101
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:15,426
a demo that we could do, but it takes half an hour, and we don't

102
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,058
have time tonight, so we won't do

103
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:22,266
that. But it is being used. I mean,

104
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:25,546
a bunch of swiss banks have been using it, and there

105
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:29,610
are a bunch of commercial enterprises that will sell this quantum

106
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,118
cryptography stuff, which, as I say, has nothing,

107
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:36,734
well, has to do with cryptography, but only in terms

108
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:40,014
of key exchange. And, I mean, basically, you need

109
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:43,534
dedicated, single mode fiber optic cable to

110
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:47,086
do this key exchange. And if you've got dedicated, single mode fiber optic

111
00:07:47,118 --> 00:07:49,970
cable, why do you need cryptography, for crying out loud?

112
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,600
Anyways. But it is something that

113
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,190
is, unfortunately, in here

114
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,400
and gets mixed up with everything else.

115
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,662
It's real, but actually a lot more limited

116
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:11,914
than people.

117
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:15,766
It's very elegant. It's a really elegant

118
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:19,082
idea. It just doesn't work in the real world.

119
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:23,086
As I say, it's always implementation in

120
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:26,394
cryptography it's always the implementation

121
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:30,362
that gets attacked, and there's all kinds of implementation attacks

122
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:33,070
on quantum cryptography, unfortunately.

123
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,650
But quantum decryption, that's just hypothesized.

124
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,554
It's going to be a long time before we see it, and by that time,

125
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:45,750
we'll have decent quantum

126
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,950
computing proof algorithms for cryptography.

127
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,926
Anyways, the thing is, with quantum computing,

128
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,500
there's also, is it a real, true quantum computer?

129
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,490
And there are various

130
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,410
quantum computers,

131
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,282
fairly small. I think the largest of them is only barely

132
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:18,714
into the three orders of magnitude qubit

133
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:21,790
range, just over 100 qubits.

134
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,578
And that isn't enough to do an awful lot of really interesting

135
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:32,606
stuff. So those are only sort of test beds

136
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,678
for the moment. And then there's d wave over in Burnaby here.

137
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:40,150
And d wave has

138
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,750
got something, but it's more of a quantum,

139
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,358
um, it's like an analog mean, you know,

140
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:53,746
we know digital computers, but we have had analog know.

141
00:09:53,788 --> 00:09:57,206
What are analog computers? Well, there's the spaghetti

142
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:00,830
computer, which does parallel sorting. You cut

143
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,246
pieces of spaghetti to the numbers that you want to sort,

144
00:10:05,428 --> 00:10:08,814
and then in one application, bang, you sort them

145
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:12,410
all, and it's done. It's a special purpose.

146
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,770
It has a single application, but there it's very effective.

147
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,878
Same thing with the slide rule. We do exact computations, but it's

148
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:23,460
a little imprecise in terms of how we read it.

149
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,498
The D wave computer is an adiabatic

150
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:32,326
quantum computer. It looks for situation where

151
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:35,800
it gets the least energy and therefore the best answer,

152
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,110
least path, best comparison simulation.

153
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,710
So the D wave Orion machines,

154
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,570
they are not full quantum computers.

155
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,510
They have some very interesting capabilities,

156
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,354
but it is at best, sort of a quantum coprocessor.

157
00:10:57,402 --> 00:11:01,680
That's the general idea. So having

158
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,714
provided some of that as a background, let's get

159
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:09,598
into specific applications

160
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:13,202
and what we can do with quantum computing in

161
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,234
terms of security. And I've

162
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:20,566
structured this by the domains of security

163
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:24,866
to give it a little bit of format

164
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:28,602
when we do it. But the general functions that we're going to be looking at

165
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:32,902
here are the same ones that the D wave

166
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:37,494
can do, and that is looking at least path calculations,

167
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:41,210
doing simulations, doing pattern matching,

168
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,460
and lease path problems.

169
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,974
The big example that people use

170
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:53,154
is the traveling salesman problem. And for example, there's like

171
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,530
28,000 cities and towns in Norway.

172
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,154
And the traveling salesman problem,

173
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:04,706
if you've only got two sites to visit, it's easier to see which

174
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:08,726
is the shortest path. It's just the shortest distance between two

175
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:13,030
points is a straight line, one straight line. But as you start adding

176
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,254
different places to go, then what's the

177
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:20,934
best path to get to all the places?

178
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:22,940
That's the traveling salesman problem.

179
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,786
And this is not something that can

180
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:31,310
be done easily with a traditional computer.

181
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,602
As I say, there's 28,000 towns in Norway.

182
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,574
They did the traveling salesman problem. I believe that

183
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:43,138
it took like ten or eleven years using

184
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,202
multiple network, high speed computers to actually do

185
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:50,914
this. Whereas you get a big

186
00:12:50,952 --> 00:12:54,180
enough quantum computer, you can do it.

187
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,920
One operation type of thing,

188
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,486
simulation. There's all kinds of

189
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,870
things that we can run with simulation,

190
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,786
climate models, weather maps, those types of

191
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:12,746
things are a really good example.

192
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:17,370
The thing is that when you're doing weather and climate simulations,

193
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,418
you divide up the atmosphere into a whole bunch

194
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:25,840
of cells, and you do calculations on each cell. And then because

195
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,366
those calculations have changed the results in all of

196
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:34,030
those cells, then you have to go back and redo the calculations

197
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,826
based on the new information from the

198
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:41,826
surrounding cells. For every cell type of thing, it's over and

199
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:45,326
over again. There's an awful lot of cells, therefore, there's an awful

200
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,838
lot of processing, and it just takes a lot of time.

201
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:52,454
Again, with a quantum computer, you're able to do

202
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:55,606
this big enough quantum computer, you're able to do this sort of

203
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:59,034
one shot so you can get closer to

204
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:03,062
real time stuff and much more accurate, and therefore

205
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:04,970
longer range forecasts.

206
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,846
The other thing that we are really good at,

207
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:14,798
and traditional computers are not, is pattern recognition. Now, there's a

208
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:18,926
picture there of airplanes. Immediately you as

209
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:22,746
a person look at that, and without even fully

210
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:26,462
concentrating on it, you probably immediately think airplanes,

211
00:14:26,526 --> 00:14:30,018
and then possibly even military airplanes and that sort of thing.

212
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:33,860
Whereas it would take a computer a long time to figure that out.

213
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,654
People are good at this. Computers are bad, but the

214
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:43,800
quantum computers are going to be much better at

215
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,154
recognition. That type of thing that we want

216
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:51,754
computers to be able to do is going to be much

217
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:56,134
easier with quantum

218
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:59,402
computers. So into

219
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:02,350
the domains of security and what we can do with them,

220
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,440
risk management. And again,

221
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,806
this is shortest path traveling salesman type

222
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,406
of problem, because when we're doing risk

223
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:16,450
management, the tools that we've got for risk management,

224
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,706
we put in all the data, collect all

225
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:24,858
the data on the risks, on the threats, the realities,

226
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:31,762
the impacts, and then the efficacy

227
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:35,522
of different types

228
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:38,794
of controls that we're going to put in place to

229
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:41,130
counter, to mitigate the risks.

230
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,378
Once we've collected all that data, we can then put it into

231
00:15:46,464 --> 00:15:50,246
sort of a giant spreadsheet and we can start playing

232
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:54,110
around. What if we put a little bit of

233
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,902
more effort, more resources into this control and

234
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,838
reduce it in that, because, of course, you've always got a fixed security

235
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:02,670
budget.

236
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,434
Does this give us a better outcome? Does that trade off,

237
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,906
give us a better outcome? But we've got to do all the

238
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:18,354
shuffling of increasing

239
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:21,830
this and decreasing that and see

240
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,480
if it gives us a better result. Now,

241
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,906
what the quantum computers, and again, once we get big

242
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:34,940
enough ones, will allow us to do is collect all that data,

243
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,066
put it in, and the quantum computer will be

244
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:43,390
able to do the least energy, shortest path type analysis

245
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,470
and tell us what's the optimum arrangement,

246
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,442
the optimum configuration, the most efficient, the most

247
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:55,250
effective, the most cost effective,

248
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,554
greatest benefit for the

249
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:03,220
fixed cost, for our

250
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,334
various controls, for all the different risks that we

251
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:11,026
have. So again, it'll sort of be a one shot

252
00:17:11,058 --> 00:17:15,174
bang and you get your answer type of thing, which right

253
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,000
now is just not possible.

254
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,546
Information classification, pattern matching is going to

255
00:17:21,568 --> 00:17:26,090
help us there. The pattern matching capabilities of quantum computers.

256
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:33,760
Risk assessment is not

257
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,546
something that people look forward to, like we said, in the risk

258
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:40,942
management area, but we're going to have to do

259
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:42,560
some thought here.

260
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,854
Is it going to be worth investing or not in quantum computing?

261
00:17:47,902 --> 00:17:51,780
And again, figuring out

262
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,354
what it can do for us and what the benefits are is

263
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:59,078
going to be part of that decision as to whether or not we're going to

264
00:17:59,084 --> 00:18:02,680
get into the field of quantum computing for those benefits.

265
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,254
In terms of security architecture, the news here is

266
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:10,522
probably all bad. This is going to give us

267
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:14,246
new architectures. It's going to be much more complex.

268
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:18,234
It's going to introduce new vulnerabilities, just a

269
00:18:18,272 --> 00:18:22,062
whole bunch of work that we need to do in regard to that,

270
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:25,994
simply because somebody might want to put a quantum

271
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:29,918
computer into our company. But it does

272
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:34,210
give us simulation of vulnerabilities and protections,

273
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,002
allowing us to sort of test out whether

274
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:44,178
or not given protections or safeguards are

275
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:48,470
going to help us in certain

276
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,590
situations.

277
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,830
Quantum devices are going

278
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,570
to, they are subject,

279
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,970
quite subject, unfortunately, to issues

280
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,442
of noise. And that is going

281
00:19:08,496 --> 00:19:12,414
to be something that we're going to have to look at and address

282
00:19:12,612 --> 00:19:14,800
in a variety of different ways.

283
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,498
Right now, the d wave they've

284
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:24,660
tried to reduce noise has much as possible, but basically

285
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,070
what they do with their systems

286
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,850
is just sort of vote run multiple times and

287
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,640
see if they get the same answer multiple times.

288
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,562
There are new technologies in terms of quantum

289
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:44,086
error correction, again, going back to

290
00:19:44,108 --> 00:19:47,994
the issue of entanglement, and that

291
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:52,150
may give us some promise in terms of fault tolerant

292
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,814
computing. So it's an area to be addressed

293
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:59,418
there in the field of access control

294
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:00,810
biometrics,

295
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,280
really, in terms of biometrics. Up until this point,

296
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,670
we're using just interesting forms of data representation,

297
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,660
but we're losing an awful lot of the data.

298
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,846
That has implications

299
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,654
for our error rates for false positives

300
00:20:24,702 --> 00:20:29,170
and false negatives. In terms of biometrics.

301
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,994
The pattern matching capability of quantum

302
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:36,920
computing is going to allow us

303
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,418
more freedom there and more ability to say,

304
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:44,886
well, yeah, that sure looks like it's

305
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,314
Verne's login or

306
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:51,420
face or fingerprints or whatever it is,

307
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,054
even though it's not quite so,

308
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:59,438
that pattern matching capability is probably going

309
00:20:59,444 --> 00:21:03,394
to assist us there in

310
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:08,190
terms of both the lease path and the simulation capabilities.

311
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,586
Information flow, which is

312
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:15,450
very time consuming right now, and covert channel analysis,

313
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,720
which again is something that's hard to figure out,

314
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,374
is probably much more possible with

315
00:21:24,412 --> 00:21:28,118
quantum computers. And again, in intrusion detection,

316
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:32,326
we've got our intrusion detection systems. The pattern

317
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,898
matching capabilities is probably going

318
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:38,250
to make those a lot more effective.

319
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,240
So cryptography now has, I say

320
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,734
we've got all the things about the

321
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:52,800
quantum computing, which really is only the

322
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,590
key negotiation, key exchange.

323
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:02,510
It's the BB 84 protocol.

324
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,386
It's tremendously elegant,

325
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:08,722
wonderful. It is able to detect

326
00:22:08,866 --> 00:22:12,294
eavesdropping for the first time. All of that

327
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:15,686
is in terms of the theory, but in

328
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:19,402
terms of the implementation, there's just been all kinds of ways to attack that.

329
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:20,410
Unfortunately,

330
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,746
the issue of being able to do sort

331
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:30,586
of parallel decryption all in one step, do brute

332
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:34,046
force attacks that just drop the right key out of

333
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:34,800
the system.

334
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,990
That is limited to the shore algorithm

335
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,490
and others that may use mod functions.

336
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,650
Right now, it's basically RSA

337
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,422
is susceptible to that. And there

338
00:22:58,476 --> 00:23:03,160
are new algorithms that are being pursued to

339
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,366
make sure that they

340
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:11,462
have a high work factor, both when you're doing classical

341
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:15,354
types of crypt analysis and the quantum crypt analysis as

342
00:23:15,392 --> 00:23:15,980
well.

343
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,706
One of the really important things in cryptography,

344
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:28,362
of course, is randomness. And quantum

345
00:23:28,426 --> 00:23:32,160
computers actually can help us there.

346
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,530
On the one hand, because they are so subject to noise,

347
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,074
we can just use the noise as a

348
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:44,066
source of randomness. But there's also,

349
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:47,670
for the first know, John said that anybody

350
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,474
who thinks of arithmetic methods of generating

351
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:55,462
randomness is in a state of sin. But the thing is that there

352
00:23:55,516 --> 00:24:00,010
are things we can do with quantum devices that

353
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,954
can give us genuinely random answers and in

354
00:24:04,992 --> 00:24:10,860
a sense, tunably random. We can take something that has

355
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,794
a random output and sort of

356
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:19,066
tweak the bias on it. So if we've got another system that is generating random

357
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:22,206
stuff, but it has a bit of a bias, we can tweak the bias in

358
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:26,098
the other direction and sort of use these two

359
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:29,906
together and come up

360
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:33,442
with a balanced source of random data.

361
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:37,206
Again, cryptography desperately needs random data all

362
00:24:37,228 --> 00:24:38,040
the time.

363
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,478
Analysis of the implementation problems. Like I say,

364
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:47,630
you always attack cryptography in implementation,

365
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,482
and quantum computing simulations will

366
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:55,580
probably be able to help us to identify those issues

367
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,670
in physical. This is really interesting.

368
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,618
Again, the noise, radio frequency interference,

369
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,670
electromagnetic interference,

370
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,266
all of that stuff is a problem and needs to be

371
00:25:13,288 --> 00:25:17,474
addressed. But the big one, possibly, depending on

372
00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:21,186
which technology eventually gets used in

373
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:25,638
this regard, is temperature. The Orion computer,

374
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:29,270
well, it's running at super cold

375
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,254
temperatures. Room temperature is

376
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:36,502
100 times as hot as

377
00:25:36,556 --> 00:25:39,974
interstellar space. But when

378
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:43,106
the Orion computer is operating,

379
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:47,482
interstellar space is 1000 times as

380
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:50,910
hot as the central core of the Orion device.

381
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,506
That's how cold we have to get for some of these operations.

382
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,510
That has implications.

383
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,610
We have to keep the power considerations

384
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,802
in some of the technologies to

385
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:12,130
create qubits for quantum computing.

386
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,882
If you lose power, you just lose

387
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:19,814
whatever process you're working on right now.

388
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:24,146
You actually lose your cpu because you've

389
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:27,474
got lattices of photons or

390
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:31,510
electrons bouncing around in channels, in laser guides

391
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,780
and things like that.

392
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:39,180
It's a nontrivial task sometimes to keep these things

393
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:44,030
power, heat and cooling.

394
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,046
All of these issues are going to have

395
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:52,346
to be addressed for operating quantum computing.

396
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,934
So there's going to be special costs, there's going to be special protections

397
00:26:55,982 --> 00:27:00,126
for devices, and you're

398
00:27:00,158 --> 00:27:03,540
probably going to want to deal with physical access control.

399
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:10,966
Who's going to get access to this business

400
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:12,550
impact analysis?

401
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,430
I've got to admit,

402
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,726
sorry, business impact analysis and business continuity

403
00:27:22,758 --> 00:27:26,394
planning. Disaster recovery planning. This is close to my heart because,

404
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:31,440
of course, of all my work in emergency management and

405
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,170
doing a business impact analysis, what's most crucial,

406
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,918
what's your most crucial, what are your

407
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:44,366
various critical business units and systems

408
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,482
and that sort of thing? The least path analysis part

409
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:52,286
of quantum computing

410
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:55,380
capabilities is definitely going to assist us there.

411
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,622
The simulation part will very much

412
00:27:59,676 --> 00:28:03,026
help us with the testing of business continuity plans

413
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:06,918
and whether or not they're effective, whether or not we've missed anything

414
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:07,640
out.

415
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,938
But what

416
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,822
really is interesting to me is the disaster management,

417
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:20,686
again, like the risk management in a

418
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:24,474
disaster, you want to direct resources to maximum

419
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:27,662
effect and that it saves lives,

420
00:28:27,796 --> 00:28:32,042
it helps

421
00:28:32,106 --> 00:28:33,300
people to,

422
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,450
well, it reduces the suffering.

423
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,302
So there's all kinds of really good stuff that can happen if

424
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,578
you do proper management in the middle of a disaster.

425
00:28:48,754 --> 00:28:52,054
And like I said,

426
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:55,782
the risk management that

427
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,960
can be done, that has to be done.

428
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,130
The calculations are very complex

429
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,154
and generally take time to perform with

430
00:29:08,192 --> 00:29:11,514
a traditional computer because there's so many different moving parts.

431
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:14,640
Well, when you've got a simulation situation,

432
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,870
you're able to do those calculations in real time. So while

433
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,694
the hurricane is going on and when it

434
00:29:23,732 --> 00:29:27,746
hits land 20 miles away from where you thought it was going to

435
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:31,474
hit land, you've got a whole bunch of things

436
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:35,562
that are in the wrong place. But with quantum computing,

437
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:38,950
you can correct that very quickly and

438
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,294
also address issues of what do we

439
00:29:42,332 --> 00:29:45,910
do to move those resources,

440
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,314
to redirect those resources to where

441
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:53,914
they are going to be most needed as

442
00:29:53,952 --> 00:29:57,660
soon as possible. Again,

443
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,902
the continuity of operations for these special

444
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:04,800
devices is definitely going to be an issue.

445
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,926
Talking about the power, talking about the cooling, what is

446
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:14,580
going to happen if there's failures there?

447
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,740
Now, in terms of application security

448
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,710
testing of our increasingly complex applications

449
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,954
is a nontrivial task and one where quantum computing

450
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:35,974
will definitely be able to assist us and give us

451
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:38,460
better information.

452
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,574
Database analysis, again, the pattern matching capabilities

453
00:30:43,622 --> 00:30:47,386
will help us. And looking, as I

454
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:51,582
talked about, in terms of the differential privacy, the cost of

455
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:55,582
privacy versus the benefit of safety and

456
00:30:55,636 --> 00:30:57,150
some of those calculations,

457
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,434
database aggregation, problem analysis,

458
00:31:01,482 --> 00:31:04,682
and again, the privacy

459
00:31:04,746 --> 00:31:09,294
budget, privacy accounting calculations that

460
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:14,106
differential privacy is meant

461
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,894
to address, um, will, you know, they're going to be very

462
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:21,766
complex. And, and so quantum computers are probably going

463
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:25,640
to be an area that will assist us in there

464
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,820
learning artificial intelligence, machine learning,

465
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:38,150
the pattern matching capabilities of quantum

466
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,782
computing are probably going to be very

467
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:46,814
useful, give us new insights in there. And the

468
00:31:46,852 --> 00:31:49,200
thing is that right now,

469
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,690
when we're trying to check the output of

470
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:59,630
a neural network, say, or of genetic computing

471
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,770
operation,

472
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,226
because those are systems

473
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:12,162
that are going beyond what traditional computers are capable

474
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:15,826
of, how do we have a check on what they're

475
00:32:15,858 --> 00:32:19,690
doing? Well, quantum computing

476
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,546
gives us those same capabilities coming at it

477
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:27,866
from a different. So again,

478
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:31,982
as with the voting in the Orion systems, probably running

479
00:32:32,036 --> 00:32:38,110
a neural net, running a quantum computing assessment,

480
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:43,140
and seeing whether or not they agree is

481
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:47,346
at least a first attempt at trying to

482
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:51,026
check some of these things that

483
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:52,340
we want to know about.

484
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,594
Again, as I say, we traditionally

485
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:02,034
say check the output against what you expected.

486
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:05,480
Well, with a lot of these artificial intelligence things,

487
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,594
what did we expect? The reason that we're doing them

488
00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:15,114
is because we wanted to get results that

489
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:16,300
we didn't expect.

490
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,074
But when we get quantum computing in

491
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:27,690
there and start looking at those results,

492
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,454
how are we going to check them? You know, those things are, are things

493
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:36,206
that we're going to be impossible to compute by classical methods.

494
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,802
And so how are we going to test whether

495
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:43,380
or not this is actually working,

496
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,214
malware, botnet decryption, as per the

497
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:54,840
intrusion detection, the pattern matching capabilities is

498
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,820
going to allow us better

499
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,674
analysis there. Also in

500
00:34:03,712 --> 00:34:07,642
terms of both malware looking

501
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:11,514
at what family does this come from and

502
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:15,558
therefore tying it back to what group, what possibly even the

503
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:19,120
individual is the person who wrote this.

504
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,706
But certainly in terms of botnets out

505
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:26,782
on the Internet looking at the control and ownership

506
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:29,970
of these large networks,

507
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,386
it's a nontrivial task and quantum computers can

508
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:37,734
help us there. There are

509
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:41,154
going to be completely new paradigms in programming

510
00:34:41,202 --> 00:34:45,234
here. It's already hard for some of us old dinosaurs

511
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:48,618
to. We're stuck in

512
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:52,646
the procedural days. I've done a little bit of functional programming

513
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:56,730
and that can turn your head, certainly object oriented.

514
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,726
I think object oriented programming is basically lying to

515
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:05,438
you because I want to know who's going to

516
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:07,790
show me an object oriented cpu.

517
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,890
It doesn't work, or rather it

518
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,506
seems to work, but sort of how, it's kind

519
00:35:17,528 --> 00:35:22,130
of a trick. But anyways, what quantum computing,

520
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,662
they're really going to change our outlook in terms of how

521
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:30,790
we think about programming. How do we make

522
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,246
sure that they work? Just being able to write a

523
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:37,506
hello program is not going to mean

524
00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:40,938
that you understand how

525
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:43,850
quantum computers actually do operate.

526
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,474
So in terms of security, we are going to have limitations

527
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:54,766
of classical and quantum devices and operations to

528
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:59,280
increase the complexity of our systems that are already very

529
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,174
complex. So the

530
00:36:04,212 --> 00:36:07,826
complexity there is going to create problems for us. On the

531
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:11,250
other hand, quantum computers

532
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,726
with simulation, with the

533
00:36:16,748 --> 00:36:22,470
pattern matching will probably provide

534
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,630
tools for us for troubleshooting,

535
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,374
which is a good thing because we will have to be troubleshooting

536
00:36:32,502 --> 00:36:36,122
where the problem lies in a system which contains both

537
00:36:36,176 --> 00:36:38,570
quantum and classical computers.

538
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,480
So again,

539
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,040
it's not going to be an easy thing to do.

540
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,998
Insider attacks pattern matching capabilities of

541
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:55,314
quantum computing may give us some

542
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:58,210
tools for insider attack detection.

543
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,370
That has been a very intractable problem.

544
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,198
It's always been an issue and it's not easy to

545
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:09,862
figure out who's going to deal

546
00:37:09,916 --> 00:37:14,706
with it. So it's

547
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:18,634
an interesting situation and

548
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:23,020
maybe we will get a tool that can help us there.

549
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,210
Telecommunications and networking. Again, we've mentioned

550
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,702
intrusion detection systems and the capabilities there,

551
00:37:30,836 --> 00:37:35,306
botnet detection and assessment and looking at the command and control, the ownership,

552
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:39,790
particularly for fast flux systems, network attack

553
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,810
analysis, all of these things are issues

554
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,100
where the tools that quantum computers give us can help.

555
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,462
We're coming to the limitations of our

556
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:58,470
spam detection, even with bayesian analysis.

557
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,614
Certainly a number of the systems that I work

558
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:03,750
with regularly,

559
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,166
it seems to be a problem. And the pattern matching

560
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:15,126
capabilities that go along with quantum

561
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:18,860
computing are probably areas where

562
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:25,370
we'll get new spam decryption tools

563
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:31,626
in there. Quantum encryption

564
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:35,902
requires special channels, the quantum cryptography. Quantum devices,

565
00:38:35,966 --> 00:38:39,314
though, are likely to be remote access for

566
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:40,820
the foreseeable future.

567
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,040
We're going to start out with centralized systems with

568
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,686
sort of like timesharing capabilities that

569
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:58,378
you can sign on, you can get something

570
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,554
from, pay rent for time

571
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:05,740
on the computer. So it's going to be remote access. And again,

572
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,558
dealing with telecommunications and networking

573
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:12,910
for these situations, particularly as we're

574
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,454
doing some computations with a quantum computer and

575
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:21,054
some with classical, there's going to be data flying back and forth, and we

576
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:25,250
need to protect that and

577
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,540
perform authentication on who's available to do it.

578
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,610
Interesting communications channels.

579
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:41,458
The quantum entities

580
00:39:41,554 --> 00:39:45,478
that we use for transmission can

581
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:48,822
provide for more than one bit per photon.

582
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,746
For example, one test sent enough data for

583
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:57,386
a small graphic image. I think it was around 128 bits in

584
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:01,920
one photon. So there's also,

585
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,242
as I say, the possibility of continuously variable

586
00:40:07,386 --> 00:40:10,794
entities. So we have an analog

587
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:14,786
photon, which is really kind of bizarre because the

588
00:40:14,808 --> 00:40:18,494
whole point of quantum computing was that it was defining

589
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:22,340
stepwise states in

590
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:26,486
entities. So being able

591
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:30,534
to send something in an analog situation is

592
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:35,510
kind of mind blowing. Quantum networks,

593
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,190
this is something that I came across recently.

594
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,220
I'm not sure about this.

595
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,510
I mean, they made it work and that sort of thing, but it's

596
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:52,846
probably going to be more local

597
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:56,830
connections in terms of distributed quantum computing

598
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,914
rather than large scale networking,

599
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:05,300
at least for the immediate future.

600
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:09,826
So that's going to be an interesting field of

601
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:13,838
research and law and investigation.

602
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:17,666
We're going to have new forensic analysis tools. The pattern matching

603
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:22,370
and simulation there could be very helpful. But the presentation

604
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,514
and acceptance in court, as per the earlier discussion

605
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:30,294
on presenting technical evidence in court, is definitely going to be

606
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:34,118
problematic. So we're going

607
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:38,040
to have to deal with that. And we managed to

608
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,010
get through all the slides.
