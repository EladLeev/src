00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,014
Hi, folks. Welcome to flow engineering. I'm going to be taking

2
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:02,080
you through how to level up your team one map at a time.

3
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,258
So let's jump in with a classic. So we've

4
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:09,682
got a ton of stuff to do, right? Everybody has this giant

5
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:13,350
backlog of crap that they love to ship,

6
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,218
and there's a million things in the way, right? We need

7
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:21,050
to do more with less. We've got staff cuts, people leaving,

8
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,982
reorganizations, demands from leadership.

9
00:02:25,126 --> 00:02:28,378
We have to always be improving value,

10
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:31,438
getting more out of what we do.

11
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:34,842
We need higher quality, fewer defects.

12
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:38,494
We want to stop firefighting, and we need to keep everybody happy,

13
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:42,414
ideally, make them more happy as time goes on. So the

14
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:46,370
question becomes, how do we do all this and stay sane? How do we

15
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,558
constantly level up? How do we constantly improve our performance,

16
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:53,998
not just as individuals, but as teams? So I'm

17
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:57,814
going to take you through an entire end to end process for doing

18
00:02:57,852 --> 00:03:01,302
this. First of all, begin with the end in mind,

19
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:05,142
right. We're going to talk about setting a clear target and

20
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:08,698
heading in a direction together. Then we're going

21
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:11,914
to look at constraints in the workflow, what's holding us down,

22
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:15,414
what's really holding us back. Then we'll

23
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:19,500
connect those constraints, those things holding us back to actual

24
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,186
factors inside of our organization that we can quantify

25
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:27,950
and understand. And then we're using to connect

26
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,822
those dependencies to capability that we can level

27
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:35,026
up, that we can improve in order to mitigate or break those

28
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,786
dependencies. And we're going to wrap all that up into what I

29
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:42,878
call flow roadmap, which is essentially a roadmap for your workflow,

30
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:46,782
how you're going to improve what you do on a day to day basis.

31
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,294
So let's dive right in. First of all, what we want to do is

32
00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:53,686
understand the current state. We want to get everybody together, and this

33
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:57,640
is a variety of stakeholders, right? We've got design,

34
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,010
development, leadership,

35
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,574
quality, product, all the folks

36
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:09,226
involved in the value stream, everyone that it takes to get something out

37
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:12,414
the door in the same room, and we'll work this

38
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:16,202
out. So first thing we want to understand is pains,

39
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:19,482
goals, questions, ideas, context.

40
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,986
What are we dealing with? Right? What are people focused on? What are they concerned

41
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:27,060
about? What do they want to do? We'll get it all out on

42
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,202
the page onto a surface that we can all look at.

43
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,978
And we use collaboration whiteboarding for this, but we could use postit notes on

44
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:38,198
a wall or a whiteboard. Then what

45
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:41,702
we do is we take all these things and we focus on

46
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:46,246
just a single target. Right? What's one thing that we can agree is

47
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:49,702
more important than everything else to focus on. So in this case,

48
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:53,500
we've got all this out on the board, all this context, all this valuable information.

49
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,146
Everybody is on the same page about heading in

50
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:00,554
this direction towards releasing twice as often.

51
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:04,222
So we can take that and we can understand, what does that actually mean?

52
00:05:04,276 --> 00:05:07,470
What does that look like? So we place that on the board,

53
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,446
right? Clear ourselves a space and understand,

54
00:05:10,628 --> 00:05:14,366
why is that important? Why is it important to customers? Why is it

55
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:18,100
important to us? Why is it important to leadership, the business?

56
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,082
And we can look at it through all of those lenses to make sure that

57
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:26,338
we all understand why this is important and we can all get behind it.

58
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:29,666
Then we look at obstacles. What are the things that could

59
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,834
get in our way? What are the things that will hold us back from achieving

60
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:36,166
that target outcome? And let's get all that out so we

61
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:39,898
can talk about it and see it. And then we want to understand what are

62
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:43,500
the things that we can learn? What are the things that we can test

63
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,994
to see if we can avoid obstacles or get to that

64
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:51,674
outcome most effectively. And I have a few of

65
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:55,086
my favorite investigations and I'm going to take you through them.

66
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:59,246
But you can really put anything on this board and you can use this in

67
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:02,590
isolation whenever you want, right? You don't have to go through

68
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,050
the entire end to end process. Sometimes you just want to clear the air

69
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,614
or get on the same page and you can use outcome

70
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:13,458
mapping to do that. But let's look at

71
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:16,914
that process again from start to finish. So we want to

72
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:20,182
explore and survey the landscape, understand what's around us,

73
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:23,718
right? What are we dealing with? Where are we, where do we want to go?

74
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,558
Then we want to understand what's important to us, why is it important

75
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:31,170
and who is it important to? For different reasons,

76
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,426
we want to look at obstacles, we want to understand what's ahead of us so

77
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:38,298
we don't trip over something the moment we get going.

78
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,918
And then we look at investigations as options. What can we do

79
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:45,214
to make progress? What can we do to learn something,

80
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:50,030
to figure out how to navigate this landscape

81
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,078
that's going to bring us to workflow? What are we doing right now and what

82
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:57,118
does that look like? How do we understand our current workflow?

83
00:06:57,214 --> 00:07:00,546
So I use value stream mapping for this. I love

84
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:04,146
it. It's extremely valuable for looking at workflow. And what

85
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:07,542
we're doing when we look at a value stream map is laying out

86
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:11,350
all the activities from start to finish for a given

87
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,014
workflow or process. In this case, we can look

88
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:18,946
at a release process or a single stories

89
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:23,014
path through a sprint or whatever you want. It can be

90
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:26,378
as high level or as low level as you want. Obviously,

91
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:28,938
you don't want to spend all your time in the weeds, and you don't want

92
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:32,154
to be so high level that it's not very useful to folks.

93
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,200
But after we lay out everything that's happening,

94
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,694
we want to measure it to understand where should

95
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:43,006
we focus. So the first thing we measure is how long do each of these

96
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:46,974
things take? And then we measure how much time is passing

97
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:50,482
between each of these steps. So we'll look at step

98
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:54,610
timing and delay timing, and then we can layer all kinds of measurements

99
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,738
in addition to that. But those basics are going to give us

100
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:02,934
a focal point, right? They're going to tell us that there's one area

101
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:07,478
or a couple of areas that we could prioritize that

102
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:10,454
we should focus on because they're taking up most of the time.

103
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:14,074
And in this case, we've got a hotspot that's taking up way

104
00:08:14,112 --> 00:08:16,966
more time than any other area of the value stream. So all of a sudden,

105
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:20,634
we've gone from everything we could possibly focus on to one

106
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:23,040
focal point, and we're all on the same page.

107
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,566
So we can take this super deep, too. We can layer on all kinds of

108
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:31,754
different information. You can see here there's calculations of totals

109
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,650
represented. We've got multiple hotspots, we've got

110
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,678
roles. These little dots represent different players

111
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:43,874
in the process. We have tools represented here. You can

112
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:47,654
really layer on a number of different dimensions to

113
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:51,590
understand the flow of work at whatever detail level you find

114
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,126
productive. So let's look at this again, start to

115
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:58,978
finish really quick. We pick a stream, and a great

116
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,166
way to pick a stream. A lot of people struggle with identifying

117
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:06,438
a value stream. Pick a single customer outcome,

118
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,542
and that customer could be internal or external.

119
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:13,422
But what is one thing that they need to do? And how

120
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:17,022
do you deliver that outcome? Right. Looking at working

121
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:20,190
backwards from that outcome, what makes it happen?

122
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,242
That helps us isolate a single stream, and then we can look at

123
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:27,650
what's happening most of the time in that workflow.

124
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,454
So we target a stream, we lay out the activities

125
00:09:31,582 --> 00:09:35,394
of what's happening. We look at the measurements for

126
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:39,114
how long each stage takes and what happens between each stage.

127
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:43,046
We add any dimensions that are going to help us understand to a

128
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:46,502
greater level of detail what's going on and where we should focus and

129
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:50,194
how we should focus our efforts. And then we gather

130
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:53,546
all that information into hotspots. What are the things that stand out? What do we

131
00:09:53,568 --> 00:09:56,250
notice? Where can we focus our attention?

132
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,186
So the next thing that we do, the third stage here,

133
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:03,610
is to look at that constraint, that hotspot, and break it down.

134
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,894
Understand what's behind this, what's the reason, right? We might have

135
00:10:06,932 --> 00:10:10,318
good ideas, maybe some of us know exactly what it is,

136
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,422
but there's a good chance that not all of us do. Right?

137
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:17,106
So this gives us an opportunity to look at that in detail,

138
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:21,006
break it down and understand it, so that we can all split

139
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,306
up and go tackle different areas or just be on

140
00:10:24,328 --> 00:10:28,770
the same page as we continue through this process of understanding

141
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,486
flow and understanding what to do about it. So in this case,

142
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:36,018
environment, setup takes forever. Why does it take forever?

143
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:38,454
Well, we have to go to the data team and we have to ask them

144
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:41,194
for stuff. We have to go to the DevOps team, we have to ask them

145
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:45,014
for stuff. They're busy, they're doing other things. So what's

146
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,962
really happening there, right? We can dig even deeper than that.

147
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:51,370
So if we zoom in and then we zoom in again,

148
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,022
we see that we're getting data refreshed by the data team.

149
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:59,082
They're cloning some data, maybe from production, maybe from another environment.

150
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:02,446
The DevOps team is doing their thing, but now we

151
00:11:02,468 --> 00:11:06,254
can take these and dig a little bit deeper. Which one of them is

152
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:10,242
the most problematic? What's the most time consuming? Which one is the biggest pain

153
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:13,890
that they don't want to deal with. So they just kick it down the road

154
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,066
and you end up waiting for it to get done. So let's look

155
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:21,634
at that from start to finish. We're going to look at dependencies,

156
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:25,606
we're going to map these dependencies. We can look at the timing of

157
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:29,282
each of these stages, like, how long do each of these take?

158
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:33,334
Where are the hotspots there? And again, we're zeroing

159
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:37,206
in. We're understanding, where is the major constraint, what's causing

160
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,134
it, what are the factors involved, so that we can focus and we know what

161
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:44,606
to do about what we see, and we can plot all

162
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:47,994
that through various means. We can use wordly mapping,

163
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,600
we can use simple matrix to understand

164
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,306
how close it is to us, how complex it is. There's a number of

165
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:00,098
different dimensions we can use to measure dependencies, but what

166
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:03,266
do we do about dependencies? Right? So we

167
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:06,866
can take those capability that we discovered

168
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:10,338
in the dependencies, the activities,

169
00:12:10,434 --> 00:12:13,954
the contributions of each of those external teams,

170
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:17,046
and we can plot them in the context of our team, so we can look

171
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:20,842
at how would we take these things over? How might

172
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:24,538
we improve the workflow around these things and

173
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:27,994
could be that we can't do anything about it, really, but maybe we

174
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:31,802
can improve something on our end that makes it easier for that other

175
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:35,086
team to deliver what we need. But the first part

176
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:38,814
about this that really matters is understanding who's doing

177
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:42,346
what, who owns it. And that could be just a liaison,

178
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:45,982
right? The person who always goes out to that team and

179
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:49,314
gets in touch with them and then waits for whatever to come

180
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,834
back. Right. But in a lot of cases we don't even have

181
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,742
that defined, right? We don't have a single point person. So no wonder

182
00:12:56,796 --> 00:13:00,950
nothing happens. Another big reason nothing happens is

183
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,550
that we often don't have a backup for those people. So if they're away,

184
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,190
if they're on vacation, if they're sick,

185
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,920
everything grinds to a halt or people are just scrambling around,

186
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,322
we can look at the skill level, where are we at with these things?

187
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:19,174
Are we actually able to take them on? Could we break those dependencies?

188
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:21,470
Do we have that level of capability?

189
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,034
And maybe it's a challenge

190
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:29,082
that we don't have sufficient resources. We might not have access to APIs

191
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:32,526
or documentation or tooling, but we can get all

192
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:35,970
that out onto the page as well and look at that as a group.

193
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,934
And all of this information can be collected into an aggregate score.

194
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:43,314
So we can use whatever scoring mechanism we want.

195
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:46,822
We just recognize that these are not

196
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:50,674
equal. Some of these might be easier to tackle

197
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:54,562
than others, and we can use that to prioritize.

198
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:58,134
Again, we're just focusing, focusing, focusing, focusing from

199
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:02,282
our target outcome down to what can we actually do to

200
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:06,026
make a huge impact on that outcome? What can we do to

201
00:14:06,048 --> 00:14:09,354
get there? How can we actually make it

202
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:12,998
happen? So let's look at capability. First of all,

203
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:17,374
we identify those capabilities, looking at the dependencies, we find

204
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:21,230
out who owns it so that we actually have like an identified point person.

205
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,922
Or at least it makes sense that we haven't been able to break the dependency

206
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:28,306
yet. We can look at skill, and that's skill as a

207
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:31,762
team. We're not singling out individuals here

208
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:35,554
because we live or die as a team. And we

209
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:38,998
look at the support mechanisms that we have, what do we have access to?

210
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:43,270
Can we actually break this dependency? Can we manage this dependency?

211
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,494
Is this something that we can actually deal with or

212
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,986
is it just going to keep dragging us down? And then all of

213
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:54,794
this factors into this score. The score that helps us

214
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:58,106
focus, helps us have really productive conversations about what

215
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:02,246
to do next. So what do we do next? We take

216
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:06,282
all this information and we can plot it with whatever prioritization

217
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:09,726
method you want. But this can be very simple. It can

218
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:13,998
be very complicated. It's really based on whatever you use to prioritize,

219
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:17,620
use whatever you're comfortable with. But a simple

220
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,098
two factor matrix for this works really well,

221
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:25,154
helps you focus on the things that end up in the top. Right.

222
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:28,322
So again, focusing, focusing, using.

223
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,402
Right. So out of that prioritization,

224
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,846
what we can do is we can understand what do we want to do

225
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,534
now, what do we want to do next and what are we going to do

226
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:41,798
later? That's, again, focus. Right. What are

227
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:45,594
we going to do tomorrow to make progress and what can wait

228
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:48,858
or what has to wait, and then what are we going to put on the

229
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,202
radar, keep on the radar but not worry about for now.

230
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:56,426
Right. We're going to tell people that we're not worrying about it until we've delivered

231
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,014
some of the outcomes that we can earlier on. So we look at

232
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:03,530
milestones and actions as a part of this. We look at measures of progress.

233
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,866
How are we going to know that we're headed in the right direction? And then

234
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:10,946
who's going to own those things? Right? Who's going to drive it forward? And this

235
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,498
is not a case of that person doing all the work,

236
00:16:14,664 --> 00:16:18,086
but someone's got to be able to say, here's where we are,

237
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:22,070
here's what we're learning, here's what's happening, here's where we're going next.

238
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,874
And so getting that all out on paper onto

239
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:29,898
this shared workspace where everybody can see and

240
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:33,466
be in alignment means that coming out of this,

241
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:37,340
things start to happen. And there's no reason why things shouldn't happen.

242
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,180
So we can lay out these things that we're going to

243
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,958
address and understand how we're going

244
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:48,506
to measure the success of those actions, those deliverables,

245
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:52,046
and who's going to own those things. And then we can have varying levels of

246
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:56,066
detail going forward. Obviously, we don't have to lay out everything for

247
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,746
later because we can tackle that when we get

248
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,362
to later or when we get closer to later. So this is really

249
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:07,382
kind of high definition in the short term and then off

250
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:10,790
into the distance. We don't need that detail.

251
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,518
We just need to know we're not going to do it right now. And that

252
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:18,294
clarifies. Again, this is clarifying and focusing.

253
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:20,954
So why do we do this?

254
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:25,142
What's the major benefit here? What are the big ideas?

255
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:29,478
We want to achieve a level of collective flow.

256
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:33,630
So the ability for all of us to work together on

257
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,618
these complicated workflows,

258
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:40,366
complicated features, code bases products in

259
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:44,254
a way that's productive. And the way that we can

260
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:47,986
connect that to our daily experiences and what

261
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:51,410
it's going to be like to work in that context is to have personal

262
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,926
flow as well. We need a combination of both in

263
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:58,946
order to really make significant progress and to really accelerate

264
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:02,850
over time without burning people out or slowing down as we scale.

265
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,270
So we balance collective flow with personal flow.

266
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,734
And so we're constantly working at varying

267
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:16,058
levels to make sure that everything flows with

268
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:19,226
minimal friction, minimal waste. So,

269
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:22,666
at the collective level, what does that mean? That means we're minimizing delays.

270
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:26,714
We're attacking those areas of the value stream where we're waiting or things aren't

271
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:30,846
happening, we're not moving things forward. And where we

272
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:34,386
can't move things forward, where things are just stuck in

273
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:38,654
a tedious process or an unproductive process, we can target

274
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:42,322
those areas and eliminate them. And then,

275
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:45,874
in a personal context, what we want to do is maximize engagement.

276
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:49,858
We want to make sure that everybody is operating at their peak

277
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:53,062
capacity. And that's not maximum work,

278
00:18:53,196 --> 00:18:57,314
it's maximum engagement. It's that sweet spot between challenge

279
00:18:57,362 --> 00:19:00,774
and skill where we see progress. We're engaged,

280
00:19:00,822 --> 00:19:05,034
we feel like we're growing, we're enjoying ourselves, and we're making the

281
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:07,580
maximum contribution that we can to the team.

282
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,690
And then we want to, as well, maximize the outcomes

283
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,086
of that engagement. What's actually being delivered? What is the

284
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:18,986
real progress that we're making? And so, through flow

285
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:23,094
engineering and bringing all this together, we're able to optimize

286
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,146
both of those dimensions, the collective and the personal.

287
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:29,986
And you really can't do the personal without the

288
00:19:30,008 --> 00:19:34,510
collective. You really need to have an optimized team workflow

289
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,154
in order for anybody to really be able to optimize

290
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:42,774
their personal sense of flow. Otherwise, they're constantly being

291
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:46,214
interrupted, they're constantly firefighting buried under

292
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:50,858
work. There's a million reasons why the collective really

293
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:54,554
negatively can affect the personal. So we really have to understand

294
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:58,330
both. But personal flow, I believe,

295
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,754
starts with collective flow. And this flow engineering

296
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:05,470
is an excellent method for optimizing collective flow.

297
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,440
So what happens when we do this right? Why should we do this?

298
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,714
Often, what we'll see is we can do more with

299
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:17,054
less, we can serve

300
00:20:17,102 --> 00:20:20,834
more people when we optimize a workflow. If we look back

301
00:20:20,872 --> 00:20:24,578
at that environment setup stage, we've got

302
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:28,434
usually shared services managing things like infrastructure,

303
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,474
and they're completely overworked. They're constantly firefighting,

304
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,962
constantly interrupted. If they get a chance to optimize

305
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:38,486
their workflow, if they can automate. If they

306
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:42,138
can understand what other teams are constrained by, then all

307
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:46,010
of a sudden they can do more with less, they can have much greater impact.

308
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,220
We see cycle times go down, lead times go down,

309
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,446
fixed times go down. So anytime there's a bug, if you have an

310
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:58,142
optimized workflow, it gets fixed faster with

311
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:01,486
less panic, with less stress, and that can

312
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:05,006
have a positive outcome on what actually gets delivered,

313
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,862
as that fix could be the difference between duct tape

314
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:13,006
and an actual solution. We see higher deployment

315
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,230
frequency, so deploying more often, learning more often,

316
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,910
getting things out and getting

317
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,990
hopefully benefits from customers. Feedback rewards,

318
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,760
a sense of progress and definitely learning

319
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,666
and lead time. This is the heartbeat of a

320
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:35,946
company, right? How often are you actually shipping things out to

321
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:39,494
customers that they can use, that they pay you for, that they're

322
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:44,538
happy with you about? So we see this dramatically

323
00:21:44,714 --> 00:21:47,450
reduced when you can minimize waste,

324
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,214
optimize flow, optimize performance, and target your

325
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:55,298
efforts so you're not just chasing every improvement opportunity.

326
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:59,886
You focus on what's going to make the biggest difference. So let's

327
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:03,422
wrap it all up. First of all, clarity your target

328
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:07,318
by understanding your target outcome. You can use an outcome map for this.

329
00:22:07,484 --> 00:22:10,870
Very simple, very effective. Then understand

330
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,002
your value stream. What's the current workflow?

331
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,642
Where's the constraint? What is being negatively

332
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:22,586
impacted by the current workflow? And then understanding the

333
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:26,282
dependencies behind those things. It could be there's zero dependencies, but often

334
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:30,066
I find the biggest delays are connected to external dependencies.

335
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:33,706
You've got to wait to go and ask for approval

336
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:37,854
or wait for somebody else to do something for you that

337
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:41,518
perhaps you could do self service and then

338
00:22:41,684 --> 00:22:45,262
capabilities. What is it going to take to break those dependencies

339
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:48,770
or improve our level of performance with the things that we do have control

340
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,454
over? That all comes down to capabilities,

341
00:22:51,582 --> 00:22:55,418
capabilities around automation, around creating

342
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:59,830
self service, ux, good documentation,

343
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,674
adopting new toolings, stitching things together within integrations,

344
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:07,698
there's all kinds of capabilities that improve flow,

345
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:11,590
and so we can use those capabilities to address dependencies

346
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,590
and accelerate. Remove that waste, remove the delays,

347
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,366
and all of this. Everything you learn, all the insights

348
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,470
from, all the mapping, goes into this flow roadmap, which is not

349
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,942
just a roadmap, it's a roadmap for how you

350
00:23:26,996 --> 00:23:30,606
ship your real roadmap, right? The roadmap of features that you need to

351
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:34,146
deliver. This is the roadmap for how you're going to ship all those

352
00:23:34,168 --> 00:23:37,602
features. So this is the most

353
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:41,266
neglected map in every organization is how

354
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:44,180
are we actually going to do the things that we want to do.

355
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,334
Not a map of things that you want to do, but the how of

356
00:23:49,372 --> 00:23:52,662
anything that you want to do. And if you unlock this,

357
00:23:52,796 --> 00:23:56,866
then you can really tackle anything. So bringing

358
00:23:56,898 --> 00:24:00,806
all this insight together, plotting into something that's actionable,

359
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:02,650
is highly effective.

360
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,610
So why do I love mapping?

361
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,362
And why are people talking about this now?

362
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:15,742
People are going to start talking about this a lot now because this

363
00:24:15,796 --> 00:24:19,658
just showed up at the very top of the thoughtworks

364
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:23,086
radar. So the thoughtworks radar has been going on forever,

365
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:26,686
and this is the first year that they've actually added what they're

366
00:24:26,718 --> 00:24:30,770
calling path to production mapping, because value stream mapping

367
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,194
means different things to different people. But essentially

368
00:24:35,262 --> 00:24:40,066
what we're talking about here is end to end flow

369
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,446
with mapping, and it showed up at the top

370
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:47,560
of the radar. Now, this is a huge

371
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,066
development. It went from not on the radar to the

372
00:24:51,088 --> 00:24:54,762
very top, and it's because it is cited by

373
00:24:54,816 --> 00:24:58,982
every success story. Everyone who talks about massive

374
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:02,126
performance improvements talks about looking at the end

375
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:05,854
to end flow and understanding where the data was

376
00:25:05,892 --> 00:25:09,786
pointing, their efforts, their attention, and making decisions

377
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:13,330
based on that data. So flow engineering is

378
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,618
really going to ride this wave, and hopefully we hear

379
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:22,942
a lot more about collaborative mapping and flow

380
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:26,360
focused mapping in the coming months and years.

381
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,834
So a little bit more about why mapping is so valuable

382
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,406
and so important working together in this

383
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:38,530
way on a visual medium. And again, if it's a whiteboard

384
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,394
or postit notes or miro or

385
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:45,898
mural, it really doesn't matter. You could use anything

386
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,114
for this, but it's engaging, right?

387
00:25:49,152 --> 00:25:53,182
It's really valuable to have everybody sort of participating and working together to

388
00:25:53,236 --> 00:25:57,754
build this picture of what everybody sees,

389
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:00,320
everybody's different perspective together.

390
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,418
As you're building this, you own it. You feel a sense of attachment to

391
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:10,642
what you've created, what you understand, and most

392
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:14,020
importantly, the next steps. What are you using to do with this?

393
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,650
Feeling a sense of ownership over that process and the outcome

394
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,070
of the map. The map that you create is really valuable.

395
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,750
A lot of people feel like they're not a part of the planning process,

396
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,378
they're not a part of decision making.

397
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:31,770
This brings people in. It's extremely inclusive.

398
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,658
It also brings people into alignment. Everybody has

399
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:39,062
a different perspective, everybody has a different opinion.

400
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:42,638
So unless you get those out into the open, you're not going to

401
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,142
understand that people are pulling in different directions or

402
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:49,466
have very different understandings of where they're

403
00:26:49,498 --> 00:26:53,078
headed and how to get there. So this provides

404
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:57,342
an opportunity for folks to really come together. It's entirely

405
00:26:57,406 --> 00:27:01,506
customized. This is not a prescriptive framework you

406
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:05,234
will not get the same outcome. You will not make the same maps

407
00:27:05,282 --> 00:27:09,346
twice. It's incredibly customizable

408
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:13,298
and it's entirely bespoke for whatever context.

409
00:27:13,394 --> 00:27:16,486
You can make the same maps in the

410
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:20,474
same team two weeks apart and have a totally different outcome that

411
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:24,518
represents where they are at that moment. So it's incredibly valuable

412
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:28,570
for representing exactly what you're dealing with,

413
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,042
not trying to copy Spotify or Netflix

414
00:27:32,106 --> 00:27:35,726
or whoever folks think is doing a good job.

415
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:38,910
This is how you do a good job in your context.

416
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,922
It's also something that you remember. You retain

417
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:46,722
the things that you learn because you're a part of interactively learning those things

418
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:50,674
and discovering them yourself along with everybody else. So it

419
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:54,046
sticks. And again, this is all developed

420
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:57,526
over the pandemic, so it's incredibly remote friendly. It works

421
00:27:57,628 --> 00:28:01,698
just as well remotely where everyone's

422
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:04,680
in a different time zone or in a room,

423
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,860
it works for both. I had very

424
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,950
wonderful results with any scenario.

425
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,994
It's very flexible and you can deploy this,

426
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:19,290
you can use this however you choose in your own environment.

427
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,274
So with that, if you want to learn more, if you're curious

428
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:26,766
about this, you can shoot that QR code. It's going to take you

429
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,778
to a bunch of links. But there's an ebook

430
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:34,582
and an email course that is entirely self guided

431
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,706
at flow. Visible is it'll take you through start to finish.

432
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:42,258
And I've also launched with a good friend of

433
00:28:42,264 --> 00:28:45,426
mine, Andrew Davis, the value stream show, which we're

434
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,986
talking about everything. Value streams,

435
00:28:48,178 --> 00:28:50,790
mapping, management, flow,

436
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,846
organizational dynamics, everything that it takes to

437
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:59,270
achieve that collective and personal flow.

438
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:03,474
And with that, I want to say thank you, really appreciate

439
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:07,014
you taking the time to check this out, and I

440
00:29:07,052 --> 00:29:10,670
hope you reach out to me and let me know what your you're doing

441
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,366
for flow or struggling with flow in your

442
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:15,434
organizations.
