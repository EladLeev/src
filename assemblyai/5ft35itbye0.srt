00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,626
Hi, this is Saurabh Bangad and I'm a technical account manager

2
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:38,722
at Google Cloud. Today's topic for conf

3
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:42,530
SRE 2023 track is divided by responsibilities

4
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,350
united by the DevOps and SRE cultures.

5
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,314
Let's dive into it. So from an agenda perspective,

6
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:52,720
I'll be discussing about how enterprises end up in a situation,

7
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,466
what new problems are created, how to solve them, and let's

8
00:00:57,498 --> 00:01:00,938
get that started. So enterprises

9
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,606
actually evolve with respect to all the industry

10
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:08,526
wide best practices, such as ISO 27,001, which lists

11
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:12,034
out lot of best

12
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,998
practices and recommendations which enterprises can adopt.

13
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:19,560
And it all starts with good intentions, such as

14
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,246
I'm just calling out a couple of examples, but there are a lot of

15
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:28,006
guidelines. So one of them is the primary one I'm focusing

16
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:31,530
on is separation of duties, which essentially means that

17
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,554
any business critical decision shouldn't be completely

18
00:01:36,752 --> 00:01:40,290
done by one individual or one party.

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,954
It has to be divided into multiple separated

20
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,400
out duties, so that if in case of

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,270
any security or privacy related incident,

22
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,946
essentially you are dividing the risk into more

23
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:01,134
than one party. This is just one of the examples

24
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:07,910
where I'm focused on there are other practices such as least

25
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,670
privileged security policies. So essentially

26
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,214
give people only what they need, don't give more than that.

27
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:20,218
It's a great security policy, but it also

28
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:23,930
gets enterprises in a situation where they actually

29
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,850
make one party more powerful than the other,

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,502
and it actually reduces slightly the

31
00:02:31,556 --> 00:02:35,246
collaboration. So this talk is all about how can

32
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:39,866
we take these best practices, but still not give up on collaboration

33
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:43,694
with some of the SRE and DevOps best practices.

34
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:47,540
So let's dive right into it. So if you look at the

35
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,050
previously highlighted best practice that we should be

36
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,814
causing separation of duties. So one

37
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:59,954
common way of doing it is allow developers to remain

38
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:03,334
focused on developing new functionalities and

39
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:06,546
features which will actually get the organizations

40
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:10,730
in a better place from business standpoint,

41
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,842
which would essentially mean developing features which

42
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:18,586
competitors have not developed yet, and keep making this

43
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:22,142
progress at a higher velocity. While the other

44
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:25,610
set of people should be responsible, the operators should be responsible

45
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,614
for maintenance and reliability and

46
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:33,140
servicing of the given service.

47
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,574
If you look at this, these two goals

48
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,874
are almost in the opposite directions. I mean,

49
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:45,286
one set of people, developers will be focused on

50
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,074
agility, they will be rewarded for the pace

51
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:53,154
with which they bring innovation, they bring new kind of cultures.

52
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:57,110
And the other set of people are responsibilities for

53
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,650
more and more stability, fewer number of

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,822
incidents and potentially no outages

55
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:08,474
or minimal outages. And these two

56
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:11,742
are not 100% aligned. One would

57
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,514
try to have more and more velocity, the other one would prefer

58
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:18,714
to have very slowness,

59
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,454
which brings the reduces risk

60
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:26,034
for the overall environment. So essentially these two

61
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:29,522
incentives are not aligned. And this is

62
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:33,294
a very common thing in enterprises to divide

63
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:36,966
duties into two or more set of

64
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,926
people at scale. Actually it looks something like this because

65
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:45,906
larger the organization, the responsibilities

66
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:49,798
start getting into. How do you do SrE prod versus

67
00:04:49,894 --> 00:04:54,026
prod versus any other environment. So the people would differ

68
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,226
even in those perspective. And there is not

69
00:04:57,248 --> 00:05:01,206
just one application that are we focused on,

70
00:05:01,328 --> 00:05:04,874
there will be more than one application and these applications

71
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:08,510
interact with one another. So the responsibilities will be divided again.

72
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,240
So you can see where I'm going with this.

73
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,562
We have people with different goals and they

74
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:21,940
all don't necessarily collaborative with one another.

75
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,766
They haven't been given a mandate or a culture where they would

76
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:29,254
necessarily collaborate. And to top on

77
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:33,186
that, we also have organizations which are fairly

78
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:36,082
common in enterprises and large banks,

79
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:39,754
where we constantly try to bring

80
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:43,674
new practices, such as a security team

81
00:05:43,712 --> 00:05:48,010
will be there, which looks after across the organizations

82
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,978
all the security policies you may have auditing team that's

83
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:56,222
again independently sitting, but has a role to play. So any

84
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,894
party that has some kind of role to play,

85
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,174
we sre talking about the whole separation of

86
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:06,430
duties to get scaled and along with that necessarily

87
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,290
people getting different goals.

88
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,026
So how do we actually address this? So I'll be coming

89
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:17,080
back to the previous slide again, but let's see what are the common ways

90
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,926
these kind of models are addressed in

91
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:27,706
a better way. So one approach is DevOps style. So if

92
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:32,054
you look at holistically, we start from a concept, then it is relevant

93
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:35,482
to a business. We do development of

94
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:39,990
that concept and we have operations where

95
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,966
it is going to keep the lights on and market

96
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:48,270
actually drives the whole growth in a flywheel model.

97
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,866
So in a DevOps style manner, actually DevOps

98
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:55,460
tries to bring those developers and operations together

99
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,514
in a more like a you build, you run fashion that

100
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:03,780
gives them some kind of ownership, which is great.

101
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,022
Also there is agile which actually tries to bridge the gap between

102
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:11,702
product development and product management. So business side

103
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:15,110
will bring the product management perspective and

104
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,398
development will actually be driving the product development.

105
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:23,820
On the other hand, SRe actually tries to do a slightly more

106
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,460
detailed approach, more or less like end to end

107
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,654
with SLO and mutual agreements that

108
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:36,378
are either formal or informal. Organizations tend

109
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:39,550
to get in a better place with SRE style.

110
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,002
Now again circling back to the slide where we were

111
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:47,426
focused on at bigger picture how it looks like,

112
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:51,282
and also reorganizations can cause these

113
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:52,930
to scale even further.

114
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,880
What does this mean? This actually means

115
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,846
the gray portion that's sitting in between,

116
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,590
almost like a wall between the two or more parties.

117
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,586
It can be a gap if it's not documented or if it's not

118
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:16,806
properly acknowledged by each party that this is the responsibility

119
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,134
of party x or party y.

120
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:23,770
So each gray area actually represents risk,

121
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,294
which are undocumented, not owned by any

122
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:31,166
party, and they can trigger at any point and cause lot of

123
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:35,090
issues to the organization. And to avoid this,

124
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,210
essentially we will be looking into some collaborative practices.

125
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,558
Also, in an enterprise

126
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:47,090
where communication gaps actually make the automation

127
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,966
go away, you can imagine two

128
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:55,062
or more parties working on a single piece where a workflow can

129
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:58,518
have human intervention much more than intended,

130
00:08:58,694 --> 00:09:01,770
and it basically brings more and more risk.

131
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,762
And statistics suggests that

132
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:10,906
change management is mainly responsible

133
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,826
for outages. So from a cultural standpoint,

134
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:18,574
like if 70% of the outages are caused by

135
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:22,570
changes in a life system, this is another pointer that

136
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,220
if changes are not coordinated well,

137
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,254
it is almost certain that it will end up in an outage.

138
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:34,050
And this happens at scale even

139
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,814
more. So let's look into what are the other things we

140
00:09:37,852 --> 00:09:41,606
can do. So step zero, always to bring

141
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:45,414
a culture where failures are

142
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:49,354
not looked at as a bad thing. Firstly, we need to have

143
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:53,382
blameless culture, blameless philosophy where postmortems

144
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:56,822
or retrospective analysis

145
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:00,034
are done to fix processes and systems,

146
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,126
not people. If people are blamed for issues

147
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:07,790
that emerge from systems and gaps and processes,

148
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,094
it won't be a psychologically safe environment. So the

149
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:15,294
first thing first is you need to have a blameless culture

150
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:18,526
where people sre highly curious

151
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:22,306
and they sre rewarded for learning, and also they're not

152
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:26,178
celebrated for heroism, for recovery from an outage.

153
00:10:26,274 --> 00:10:29,830
Short term it works well, but medium and long term

154
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,570
heroism for celebration of heroism

155
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,806
doesn't go anywhere. The organization continues to have more

156
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:40,234
and more failures, and you just don't evolve in terms

157
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,820
of moving from a bad system to a good.

158
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,378
So let's dive into the main part,

159
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:51,550
the solutioning. So firstly,

160
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,598
culture. Bringing a culture requires few things.

161
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:59,406
This is a text heavy slide, so you could definitely pause and go through

162
00:10:59,428 --> 00:11:03,122
each point. I'm going to do elaborate each point

163
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:06,770
as much as possible. So firstly, sense of ownership and accountability

164
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,066
is required from each party. So they

165
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,814
need to see this as a joint problem, rather than my

166
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:19,526
problem, your problem, or not my problem. It has

167
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:23,254
to be seen as a joint problem because even if they

168
00:11:23,292 --> 00:11:26,230
have different sub goals or different goals,

169
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,390
if individually they succeed, but as an organization,

170
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,186
if they fail, that will be a bigger failure. So sense of

171
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,450
ownership is the most important one to get there.

172
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,374
We need to have some core metrics which are agreed by

173
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:45,486
each party. They all have to agree on some

174
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:49,022
common signals where they collaborative and try

175
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:52,802
to improve from, let's say 10% to 20%

176
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:55,886
to 30%. It's considered as progress.

177
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:59,780
That would be a good signal and they all have to

178
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,770
jointly influence those signals.

179
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,054
Communication and collaboration is something that I'll be describing more on the next

180
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:12,390
slide. They also have to agree on change management practices.

181
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,706
For example, team one has upstream

182
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:19,994
and downstream dependencies. Potentially they

183
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,994
should be communicating and have coordination on how

184
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:27,798
they manage change. Also, change management practices

185
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:31,920
in pre prod versus prod would differ and

186
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,750
even the type of change is it p one,

187
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,686
p two, what kind of impact one would expect out

188
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:45,166
of that? These are basic parameters that agreeing

189
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,826
for change management practices would mean.

190
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:52,482
Also, continuous improvement is something as

191
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:56,386
all the parties, they have to work together, they should be agreeing

192
00:12:56,418 --> 00:13:00,120
on continuous improvements. For example,

193
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,258
automating lot of things which don't require

194
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:10,682
human decision making or reduction in time by

195
00:13:10,736 --> 00:13:14,586
eliminating some unnecessary processes. And people should

196
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:18,666
be rewarded for this. This is the best way to get from

197
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:22,058
a good to better environment. Lastly,

198
00:13:22,154 --> 00:13:26,190
this is probably the most important for enterprises where

199
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,222
reorgs SRE common. After every reorg, you should be going

200
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:34,606
over all the decisions or all

201
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:38,206
the working model so that you may end

202
00:13:38,228 --> 00:13:41,886
up in a situation where you would have all

203
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,710
the accountable parties agreeing again,

204
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,230
even under the new leadership or even under the new goals.

205
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,906
Let's dive into communication and collaboration. So firstly,

206
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:57,802
you need to have bi directional modes such as Google

207
00:13:57,856 --> 00:14:01,574
Chat faces or slack channels where these teams

208
00:14:01,702 --> 00:14:06,806
exist, and they kind of have threaded discussions

209
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:10,586
on topics. So why I suggest bi directional?

210
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:14,158
I mean, most often if you're using just the

211
00:14:14,164 --> 00:14:17,194
ticketing system or just emails,

212
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:21,694
it may not function as a collaborative environment where

213
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:25,806
the flow of information is usually one way and it's

214
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:29,474
a formal way of documenting everything. While they

215
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:32,894
all have their advantages from a collaboration perspective,

216
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:36,706
they also have disadvantages. So they should be used for tracking

217
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:40,514
purposes. But for collaboration purposes, bi directional communication

218
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:43,958
channels do the best thing. Also probably

219
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:47,754
maybe having cadences where you

220
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:51,526
bring initiatives for next quarter,

221
00:14:51,638 --> 00:14:54,540
plan them well and execute it together.

222
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:58,502
Secondly, you should be having joint artifacts,

223
00:14:58,566 --> 00:15:03,322
so where documentation pages are not silos

224
00:15:03,386 --> 00:15:06,590
or islands where people

225
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,750
develop their own things. As opposed to that, it should be a collaborative,

226
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,738
jointly owned documentation pages. This also

227
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:21,106
applies to roadmap items where all

228
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:25,894
the teams plan together a lot of items which would actually address

229
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,800
future issues as well.

230
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,894
Every environment is always dynamic and you have changes of

231
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:37,810
some nature all the time. So roadmap items are definitely

232
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,090
one of the important ones. Lastly, the tooling.

233
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:46,634
If you have common tooling, you would actually be

234
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:49,862
encouraging collaboration to improve the tool as well.

235
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:54,234
If you have better tooling, you end up in a much efficient environment

236
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:57,310
which is operationally smoother.

237
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,502
Changes as previously suggested, changes should be coordinated.

238
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:07,006
So perhaps in your regular sync

239
00:16:07,038 --> 00:16:10,434
ups, regular cadences, you should be talking about what

240
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:13,874
kind of changes is

241
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:18,354
one team going to deploy and what they expect in terms of impact

242
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:21,282
on those other teams, either downstream or upstream,

243
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:24,886
and how it may affect their day to

244
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:27,994
day operations. So these things

245
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:30,490
need to be defined as common set of standards.

246
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,090
And lastly, going into best practices,

247
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,820
informal learning. Informal collaboration happens

248
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,638
when you sre meeting agenda free.

249
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:46,474
So this would mean one of the teams sharing

250
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:49,902
their lessons about most recent deployment and

251
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:53,698
how it actually brought new kind of

252
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:57,246
changes in the environment, or tgifs,

253
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:00,926
which are fairly common. As one can see in Google's

254
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,810
culture, somewhat similar exists in many other corporate environments.

255
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,240
So you could encourage those.

256
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,014
Any kind of knowledge sessions or shadowing opportunities would

257
00:17:13,052 --> 00:17:16,710
allow you to actually push one team to step into

258
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,330
other team's shoes and learn

259
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,202
from what kind of challenges they may have. And this would allow

260
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:28,070
them to bond well together and understand each other's constraint

261
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,140
and make progress together.

262
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,560
Finally, my last take on this is because

263
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,842
enterprises have very different dynamics.

264
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:44,926
It can actually lead into complexities

265
00:17:45,118 --> 00:17:47,780
which were not predicted. So for example,

266
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,302
if you have meetings that SRE scheduled on a monthly basis,

267
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:54,770
but if they don't result in outcomes,

268
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,538
they actually become toil and they don't necessarily

269
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:03,122
bring any improvements. Unnecessary approvals

270
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:06,866
can come in when you have too many teams,

271
00:18:06,898 --> 00:18:11,334
and in the name of collaboration, if they start adding

272
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,330
approvals which work for the time being,

273
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,742
but after some reorgs or after some deprecation

274
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,634
of some tooling, they actually become unnecessary approvals.

275
00:18:22,682 --> 00:18:26,254
So it becomes important to assess your situation whether

276
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:31,194
some approvals sre unnecessary unaligned

277
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:34,498
maintenance windows. Actually, this one means,

278
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:39,154
let's say, if you have three teams which

279
00:18:39,192 --> 00:18:42,786
have no change management protocol in

280
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:46,518
place, they may actually end up in one team doing

281
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:50,498
maintenance on a Monday, one team doing on a Wednesday,

282
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:53,670
and one team doing on a Friday.

283
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,770
If they have no relationship or dependency between

284
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,482
one another, it's absolutely okay. But if

285
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:05,500
they are upstream downstream of one another,

286
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,162
they may actually cause a much wider impact for your

287
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:14,142
end users, where you may end up in three

288
00:19:14,276 --> 00:19:17,422
maintenance happening in the same week,

289
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:21,326
which are not even on happening on the same day. You have basically downtime on

290
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:25,410
Monday, you may have downtime on Wednesday, you may have downtime on Friday,

291
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,306
which may work for those specific teams, but it will definitely

292
00:19:30,408 --> 00:19:34,446
be a bad idea for your end users and your organization's

293
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:38,498
reputation when we are encouraging

294
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:42,200
collaboration and better communication. It may also

295
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,846
encourage an environment where you are encouraged to build

296
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:52,070
tooling. This tooling may be absolutely fancy,

297
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,862
but it may be unnecessary and unusable from a business standpoint.

298
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:59,290
So you need to assess whether you are doing the right thing

299
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,620
from time to time.

300
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,914
As we saw in earlier slides, there can be gray areas which pose

301
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:10,010
risk, so you may have an environment

302
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,278
where there are no incentives for reducing these gray areas.

303
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:16,770
People may not actually do anything about it and they just continue

304
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,970
to operate even if it's an inefficient environment.

305
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,570
And lastly,

306
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,720
one should be having all the aligned metrics as we spoke about

307
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,798
golden signals and agreeing for common set of

308
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:35,334
metrics. So in many environments it

309
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:38,914
actually happens that for example, if we go back to previous

310
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:42,146
slide where we had set of developers, set of operators,

311
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:46,550
they had contradicting metrics which actually made the environment

312
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,790
not so great for for the organization.

313
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,378
So that's it. That's all I had on my agenda.

314
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:57,740
Thank you so much for joining me.
