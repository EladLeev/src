00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,574
Hi, I'm Julie Gunderson, DevOps advocate here at

2
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:35,734
Pagerduty, and I'm here to talk to you today about

3
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:39,734
postmortems, continuous learning and enabling a

4
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:43,810
blameless culture. So when we talk about postmortems,

5
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,106
a postmortem is a process, and it's intended

6
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:50,714
to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves

7
00:00:50,762 --> 00:00:54,414
a blamefree analysis and discussion soon after an event has taken

8
00:00:54,452 --> 00:00:57,758
place and you produce an artifact. And that artifact includes a

9
00:00:57,764 --> 00:01:01,594
detailed description of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incidents.

10
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:05,618
It also includes a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar

11
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:09,506
incident from occurring again in the future. You also want to include an

12
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,202
analysis of how the incident response process itself work.

13
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:17,890
Like the value of having a postmortem, it comes from helping institutionalize

14
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,638
that culture of continuous improvement. The reason that we do

15
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:25,510
postmortems is because during incidents response, the team is 100%

16
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,142
focused on restoring service. They cannot and they should

17
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:32,474
not be wasting time and mental energy thinking about

18
00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:35,846
how to do something optimally or performing a deep dive

19
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:39,334
on what caused the incident. That's why postmortems are essential.

20
00:01:39,462 --> 00:01:43,262
They provide that peacetime opportunity to reflect once

21
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:46,542
an issue is no longer impacting users and

22
00:01:46,596 --> 00:01:50,126
organizations. They tend to refer to the postmortem process

23
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:53,982
in slightly different ways. They're after action reviews or post incident

24
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:57,662
reviews. Sharing reviews incident reviews incidents

25
00:01:57,726 --> 00:02:00,930
reports it really doesn't matter what you call it,

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,222
except for this last one, root cause analysis.

27
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:07,240
Because we will talk about why words matter.

28
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,454
It just matters that you do this.

29
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:14,514
The postmortem process. It drives that culture

30
00:02:14,562 --> 00:02:18,386
of learning. Without a postmortem, you fail to recognize what you're

31
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:21,750
doing right or where you could improve, and most importantly,

32
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,214
how to avoid the same mistakes in the future. Writing an effective postmortem

33
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:29,606
allows you to learn quickly from mistakes

34
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:33,114
and effectively and improve your systems and processes.

35
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:37,402
And a well designed, blameless postmortem allows teams to continuously

36
00:02:37,466 --> 00:02:41,322
learn, serving as a way to iteratively improve

37
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:44,558
your infrastructure and incident response process.

38
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:48,306
So you want to be sure to write detailed and accurate postmortems in

39
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:52,066
order to get the most benefit out of them. Now, there are certain times that

40
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,630
you should do a postmortem. You should do a post mortem

41
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,682
after every major incident. This actually includes anytime

42
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,618
the incident response process is triggered, even if it's later discovered

43
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:07,026
that the severity was actually lower, or it was a false alarm,

44
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:11,146
or it quickly recovered without intervention. A postmortem shouldn't be

45
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:14,298
neglected in those cases because it's still an opportunity

46
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:18,854
to review what did and did not work well during the incident response

47
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:22,398
process. If the incident shouldn't have triggered an incidents process,

48
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:26,046
it's worthwhile to understand why it did so. Monitoring can be

49
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:29,646
tuned to avoid unnecessary triggering incident response processes in

50
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,154
the future, and doing this analysis and follow up

51
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:36,850
action will help prevent that alert fatigue going forward.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,286
And just as restoring a major incident becomes

53
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,774
top priority when it occurs, completing the postmortem

54
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:47,794
it's prioritized over planned work. Completing the postmortem

55
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:51,014
it's the final step of your incident response process.

56
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:54,486
Delaying the postmortem delays key learnings that

57
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:58,386
will prevent the incident from reoccurring. So pager Duty's internal

58
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:01,946
policy for completing postmortems is three business days for

59
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:06,106
a sev one and five business days for a sev two. And because

60
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,546
scheduling a time when everyone is available can be

61
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:13,734
difficult, the expectation is actually that people will adjust their calendars to attend

62
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:17,998
the postmortem meeting within the time blame and at the end of every major

63
00:04:18,084 --> 00:04:21,834
incident call or very shortly after the incident commander.

64
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,746
That's what we call the command structure here at pager duty, they select

65
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,266
and directly notify one responder to own completing the

66
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:33,042
postmortem and note that the postmortem owner is not

67
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:36,118
solely responsible for completing the postmortem themselves.

68
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:40,150
Writing of postmortem it's a collaborative effort and it should include everyone

69
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,954
involved in the incident response process. While engineering

70
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:47,810
will lead the analysis, the postmortem process should involve management

71
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,318
and customer support and the business communications teams.

72
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:54,922
The postmortem owner, they coordinate with everyone who

73
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:59,158
needs to be involved to ensure the post mortem is completed in a timely manner.

74
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:03,014
And it's really important to designate a specific owner to avoid

75
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:07,054
what we call bystander effect. If you ask all responders or a team to

76
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:11,102
own completing the post mortem, you risk everyone assuming that someone else

77
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:15,246
is doing it and therefore no one does. So it's really important to

78
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:19,122
designate an owner for the postmortem process, and some of that

79
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:23,070
criteria can be someone who took a leadership role during the incident

80
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,210
or performed a task that led to stabilizing the service.

81
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,778
Maybe they were the primary on call, or maybe they manually triggered

82
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:33,622
the incidents to initiate that incident response process. It is

83
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:36,806
very important to note, though, that postmortems are

84
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:40,266
not a punishment and the owner of the postmortem is not the

85
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:44,358
person that caused the incidents. Effective postmortems are blameless

86
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:48,058
in complex systems. There's never a single cause but a

87
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:52,234
combination of factors that lead to failure, and the owner is simply

88
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:56,234
an accountable individual who performs select administrative tasks,

89
00:05:56,362 --> 00:06:00,442
follows up for information, and drives that postmortem to completion.

90
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:04,474
So writing the postmortem will ultimately be a collaborative effort.

91
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:08,386
But selecting a single owner to orchestrate this collaboration is

92
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:11,634
what ensures that it gets done. So let's talk a little

93
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:15,266
bit about blame. As it professionals, we understand that failure is

94
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:18,374
inevitable in complex systems, and how we respond to

95
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,926
failure when it occurs is what matters. So in the

96
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,522
field guide to understanding human error, Sidney Decker

97
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:29,034
describes two views on human error. There's this old view,

98
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:32,438
which asserts that people's mistakes cause failure,

99
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:36,166
and then the new view, which treats human error as a symptom

100
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:39,722
of a systematic problem. The old view ascribes to that

101
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:43,162
bad apple theory, which believes that by removing the bad actors,

102
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:47,146
youve just going to prevent failure. And this view attaches

103
00:06:47,178 --> 00:06:51,034
an individual's character to their actions. Assuming negligence

104
00:06:51,082 --> 00:06:54,974
or bad intent is what led to the error. An organization that

105
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:58,146
follows this old view of human error, they may respond to

106
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,534
an incident by finding that careless individual who caused the incident

107
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:05,506
so that they can be reprimanded. And in that case, engineers will hesitate

108
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:09,234
to speak up when incidents occur for fear of being blamed.

109
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:12,770
And that silence can increase overall.

110
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,626
It can increase that meantime to acknowledge that meantime

111
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:20,882
to resolve, and it really exacerbates the impact

112
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:24,074
of incidents. For the postmortem process to

113
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:27,482
result in learning and system improvements, the new

114
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:31,186
view of human error must be followed. In complex systems of software

115
00:07:31,238 --> 00:07:34,846
development, a variety of conditions interact to lead to

116
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:37,982
failure. And the goal of the postmortem is to understand

117
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:42,170
what systematic factors led to the incident and to identify

118
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,918
actions that can prevent this kind of failure from reoccurring. So a

119
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:49,602
blameless postmortem stays focused on how a mistake was made

120
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:53,726
instead of who made the mistake. And this is a crucial mindset,

121
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:57,486
leveraged by many leading organizations for ensuring

122
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,414
postmortems have that right tone. And it empowers engineers to

123
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,870
give truly objective accounts of what

124
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,530
happened, because you're eliminating that fear of punishment.

125
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,818
But blamelessness is hard, and it's really easy to agree that

126
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:15,370
we want a culture of continuous improvement. But it's difficult to

127
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,494
practice that blameless listen required for learning the unexpected nature

128
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:23,194
of failure. It naturally leads humans to react in a way that interfere

129
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:26,654
with our understanding of it. When processing information,

130
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:31,114
the human mind, it unconsciously takes shortcuts. And by applying

131
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:34,898
general rules of thumb, the mind optimizes for timeliness over

132
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:39,102
accuracy. And when this happens, it produces an incorrect

133
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,934
conclusion. It's called a cognitive bias.

134
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:45,906
So J. Paul Reed argues that the blameless postmortem is

135
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:49,862
actually a myth because the tendency to blame is hardwired through millions of years

136
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,682
of evolutionary neurobiology, and ignoring this tendency

137
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:56,594
or trying to eliminate it entirely is impossible,

138
00:08:56,722 --> 00:09:00,230
and so that it's more productive to be blame aware.

139
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,434
I'll touch on this and some of the biases next, but for more

140
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:07,366
details, read Lindsay Homewood's article on cognitive biases

141
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:11,650
that we must be aware of when we're performing post mortems.

142
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,882
So one of the errors that we see is the fundamental attribution

143
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:19,422
error, and it's the tendency to believe that what people

144
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,134
do reflects their character rather than their circumstances. And this

145
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:27,314
goes back to that old view of human error, assigning responsibility for

146
00:09:27,352 --> 00:09:31,102
a failure to bad actors who are careless and clearly incompetent.

147
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:34,546
Ironically, we tend to explain our own actions by

148
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:38,226
our context, not our personality. So you can combat

149
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:42,034
that tendency to blame by intentionally focusing the analysis

150
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,554
on the situational causes rather than the discrete

151
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:49,254
actions that the individuals took. Another pervasive

152
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:53,670
bias is cognitive bias. It's a confirmation bias,

153
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,190
which is the tendency to favor information that reinforces

154
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,726
existing beliefs. So when presented with ambiguous

155
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:03,886
information, we tend to interpret it in a way that supports our

156
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:07,390
existing assumptions. And when combined with that old view

157
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,006
of human error, this bias is dangerous for postmortems because

158
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,858
it seeks to blame that bad apple. And so when approaching the

159
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,998
analysis with the assumption that an individual is at fault,

160
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:21,854
you're going to find a way to support that belief despite evidence

161
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:25,150
to the contrary. So, to combat confirmation bias,

162
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,866
Lindsay Holm would suggest appointing somebody to play devil's advocate,

163
00:10:28,898 --> 00:10:32,150
to take a contrarian viewpoint during an investigation.

164
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,182
Be careful, though, when doing this, because you want to be cautious of

165
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,942
introducing negativity or combativeness with the devil's advocate.

166
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:43,610
You can also counter confirmation bias by inviting someone

167
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,114
from another team to ask any and all questions that

168
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:51,062
come to their mind, because this will help surface lines of inquiry,

169
00:10:51,126 --> 00:10:55,130
as the team may have learned to take some of these things for granted.

170
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,070
Now, hindsight bias is a type of memory distortion where

171
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,570
we recall events to form a judgment. So knowing the outcome,

172
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,706
it's easy to see the event as being predictable, despite there

173
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,890
having been little or no objective basis for predicting it.

174
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,490
Often we recall events in a way that make ourselves look better.

175
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,926
An example is when a person is analyzing the causes

176
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,134
of an incident, and they believe they knew that it was going to happen like

177
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:24,342
that. So enacting this bias it can lead to defensiveness and

178
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:28,146
a division within the team. So homewood actually suggests avoiding

179
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:32,006
the hindsight bias by explaining events in terms of foresight

180
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:35,258
instead. So start your timeline analysis at a

181
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:38,826
point before the incident and work your way forward instead of

182
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:42,438
backward from resolution. And then there's negativity bias.

183
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:46,078
And this is the notion that things of a more negative nature have a

184
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:49,614
greater effect on one's mental state than those of a neutral or

185
00:11:49,652 --> 00:11:53,786
even positive nature. Research on social judgments

186
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:58,014
had shown that negative information disproportionately impacts

187
00:11:58,062 --> 00:12:01,454
a person's impression of others. And this relates

188
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:05,226
back to the bad apple theory, the belief that there are negative actors

189
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,062
in your organization to blame for failures. Studies have also

190
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:12,722
shown that people are more likely to attribute negative outcomes

191
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:16,742
to the intentions of another person rather than

192
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:20,346
neutral and positive outcomes. And this also explains our

193
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:23,946
tendency to blame individuals characters to explain a

194
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,770
major incident. In reality, things go right more often

195
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,402
than they go wrong. But we tend to focus on and magnify

196
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,942
the importance of negative events, focusing on

197
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:38,650
exaggerating and internalizing incidents as negative events.

198
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,218
It can be demoralizing and it can lead to burnout,

199
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:45,886
reframing incidents as learning opportunities and remembering

200
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:49,426
to describe what was handled well in the response process.

201
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:52,766
That can help to balance the perspective.

202
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:56,318
And so these biases can damage team relationships if they

203
00:12:56,344 --> 00:13:00,306
go unchecked. It's important to be aware of these tendencies

204
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,782
so we can acknowledge bias when it occurs. By making

205
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:07,158
postmortems a collaborative process, teams can work as a

206
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:11,082
group to identify blame and then constantly dig

207
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:13,446
deeper in the analysis.

208
00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:16,682
So acknowledging blame and working past it,

209
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:20,166
it's easier said than done. Think about what behaviors

210
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:23,770
can we adopt to move towards a blameless culture?

211
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,206
And I'm going to share a few of those with you.

212
00:13:26,308 --> 00:13:30,270
So ask what and how questions rather

213
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,782
than who or why. So going back to Lindsay homewood,

214
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,458
what questions are like what did you think was happening?

215
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:41,234
Or what did you do next? Asking what questions

216
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:45,266
grounds the analysis in the big picture of

217
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:48,782
the contributing factors to the incident. In his article

218
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:52,162
the Infinite House, John Allspa encourages

219
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:56,258
us to ask how questions because they get people to describe

220
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,706
at least some of the conditions that allowed an event to take place.

221
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:03,766
Homewood also notes that how questions can help clarify technical details,

222
00:14:03,878 --> 00:14:07,654
distancing people from the actions they took. So avoid

223
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:12,038
asking why questions because it forces people to justify

224
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:15,390
their actions. It really does attribute blame, like,

225
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,066
well, why did you just do that? Or why did you take that action?

226
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:22,382
So think about how you can reframe those in the what and how

227
00:14:22,436 --> 00:14:25,922
perspective and then consider multiple and

228
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:29,186
diverse perspectives. This is actually a great time to

229
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,834
bring in maybe an intern. They tend to think about things

230
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:36,342
in ways that people who have been practicing this for 20

231
00:14:36,396 --> 00:14:39,574
years may not think about things. So consider the

232
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,270
different perspectives and ask why

233
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,454
a reasonable, rational, and decent person may

234
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:50,150
have taken a particular action. When analyzing failure,

235
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,782
we may fall into the victim, villain, and helpless stories

236
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:57,898
that propel those emotions and attempt to justify our

237
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:01,854
worst behaviors. And you can move beyond blame by

238
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:04,734
telling the rest of the story. Ask yourself,

239
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:08,800
why would somebody may have done this?

240
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,378
Because you want to put yourself in that person's shoes.

241
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:16,270
This thinking will help turn attention to the multiple systematic

242
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,154
factors that led to the incident versus the WHO.

243
00:15:19,272 --> 00:15:22,914
Also, when in crying about human action, abstract it to

244
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:26,582
an inspecific responder. I mean, anybody could have made

245
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:29,554
that same mistake. We've all made mistakes.

246
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:33,798
These are not intentional. It's not that bad. Apple theory and

247
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:37,286
whether you're introducing postmortems as an entirely new practice at

248
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:41,210
your organization or working to improve an existing process,

249
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,746
culture change is hard. And change doesn't have to

250
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:48,202
be driven by management. Oftentimes the bottom up

251
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:51,242
changes are more successful than those top down mandates.

252
00:15:51,306 --> 00:15:54,462
Anyways, no matter your role, the first step

253
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:58,254
to introducing a new process it is to get buy in from

254
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:02,538
leadership and individual continuous to practice blameless postmortems

255
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:06,130
and encourage that culture of continuous improvement. You do need

256
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,370
commitment from leadership that no individuals will be reprimanded in any way

257
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,746
after an incident. And it can be difficult to get

258
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:17,466
this buy in when management holds that old view of human error,

259
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,174
believing that the bad actors cause failures and that they'll never

260
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:24,614
have failures if they just remove those bad actors. So to

261
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:27,998
convince management to support a shift to blameless analysis,

262
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,450
clarify how blame is harmful to the business and

263
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,286
explain the business value of blamelessness. Punishing individuals

264
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:38,842
for causing incidents. It discourages people from speaking

265
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:42,686
up when problems occur because they're afraid of being blamed. And as

266
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:46,074
I talked about earlier, this silence just increases that meantime

267
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:49,806
to acknowledge and meantime to resolve. You want people to

268
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:53,282
speak up when problems occur. And organizations can

269
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:56,786
rapidly improve the resilience of their systems and increase the

270
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,882
speed of innovation by eliminating the fear of blame and

271
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:04,274
encouraging collaborative learning. The inclination to

272
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:07,714
blame individuals when faced with a surprising failure.

273
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:11,618
It's ingrained deeply in all of us. And it may sound silly,

274
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:15,234
but when selling a new blameless postmortem process to management,

275
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:19,202
do try to avoid blaming them for blaming others.

276
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:22,650
Acknowledge that that practice of blamelessness, it's difficult

277
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,582
for everyone, and teams can help hold each other accountable

278
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:30,518
by calling each other out when blame is observed in response to failure.

279
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:34,250
Ask leadership if they would be receptive to receiving that feedback

280
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,010
if and when they accidentally suggest blame after an incident.

281
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,386
A verbal commitment from management to refrain from punishing

282
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:45,342
people for causing incidents is important to start introducing blameless

283
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:48,978
postmortems. But that alone isn't going to eliminate the

284
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:52,354
fear of blame. Once youve have leadership support,

285
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:55,858
you also need buy in from individual continuous who

286
00:17:55,864 --> 00:17:58,790
will be performing that postmortem analysis?

287
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,802
Share that you have commitment from management that no one will be punished

288
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:06,406
after an incident because the tendency to blame it

289
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:09,542
turns out it's not unique to managers and leadership.

290
00:18:09,686 --> 00:18:13,050
Explain to the team why blame is harmful to trust

291
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,194
and collaboration, agree to work together to become more and

292
00:18:17,232 --> 00:18:21,014
more blame aware, and kindly call each other out when blame

293
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:24,942
is being observed. People need to feel safe talking about

294
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:28,538
failure before they're willing to speak up about incidents.

295
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:33,322
And when Google studied their teams to learn what behaviors made groups successful,

296
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:37,234
they found that psychological safety was the most critical factor for

297
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:40,274
a team to work well together. And so Harvard Business

298
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:44,386
School professor Amy Edmondson defines psychological safety as

299
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:47,274
a sense of confidence that a team will not embarrass,

300
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,978
reject, or punish someone for speaking up. And this also describes

301
00:18:50,994 --> 00:18:54,822
what we're trying to achieve with blameless postmortems. The team does not

302
00:18:54,876 --> 00:18:58,582
feel punishment for speaking up about incidents, a sense of safety.

303
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:02,122
It makes people feel comfortable enough to share information about

304
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:05,658
incidents, which allows for deeper analysis and then

305
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,858
results in learning that improves the resilience of

306
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:12,074
the systems. And the Dora State of DevOps report

307
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:16,186
actually showed that psychological safety is a key driver of high performing

308
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:20,046
software delivery teams. So the number one thing that you can

309
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:23,354
do for your teams is to build that culture of psychological

310
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:27,346
safety that can be your gateway to culture change. So how

311
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:30,814
do you do this again? Culture change doesn't happen overnight.

312
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:34,702
You want to start small, you want to iteratively introduce new practices

313
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:38,914
to an organization small, and you share successful

314
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:42,514
results of experimenting with new practices. And then you slowly expand

315
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:46,022
those practices across teams, similar to how we talk about

316
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:49,666
Blast radius with chaos engineering, you can start experimenting

317
00:19:49,698 --> 00:19:53,274
with blameless postmortems with just a single team. And to get

318
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:57,094
started, you can actually use our how to write a postmortem guide

319
00:19:57,142 --> 00:20:00,394
at postmortems pagerduty.com to see

320
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,978
some tips. It's also easy to start practicing blameless postmortems

321
00:20:05,014 --> 00:20:08,202
by analyzing smaller incidents, maybe before tackling

322
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:11,854
major ones, because the business impact of that incident is

323
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:15,330
lower, there's less pressure to scapegoat an individual as the cause

324
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,026
of an incident. If someone does fall back on blaming an

325
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:22,606
individual, there's also lower repercussions for causing

326
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,526
a minor incident. Simply put, the stakes are lower when analyzing a minor

327
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,226
incident. So doing post mortems for smaller incidents, it allows

328
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:34,294
the team to develop that skill of deeper system analysis that goes

329
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:37,894
beyond how people contributed to the incident and

330
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:41,270
remembering that this is a skill and skills require practice.

331
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,810
Also, sharing the results of postmortems is very important.

332
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,166
It has a couple of benefits. It increases the system knowledge

333
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:51,862
across the organization. And actually, it also reinforces

334
00:20:51,926 --> 00:20:55,486
a blameless culture. When postmortems are shared, teams will

335
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:58,890
see that individuals are not blamed or punished for incidents,

336
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,854
and then this reduces that fear of speaking up when the incidents

337
00:21:02,922 --> 00:21:06,322
inevitably occur. So, creating a culture where information

338
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:10,046
can be confidently shared, it leads to that culture

339
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:13,794
of continuous learning in which teams can

340
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:16,914
work together to continuously improve.

341
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,646
We also encourage teams to learn postmortem best practices from each

342
00:21:20,668 --> 00:21:24,818
other by hosting a community of experienced postmortem writers.

343
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:28,330
So we have a community of experienced postmortem writers who are

344
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,230
available to review postmortems before they're shared more widely.

345
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,714
And this ensures that the blameless analysis is

346
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:40,794
there through feedback and coaching while those postmortems are

347
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,570
being written. And you can scale culture through sharing.

348
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:48,314
So the state of DevOps report, it told us that operationally mature

349
00:21:48,362 --> 00:21:52,286
organizations, they adopt practices that promote sharing. People want

350
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:55,522
to share their successes, and when people see something that's going

351
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:59,266
well, they want to replicate that success. And it

352
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:02,818
may seem counterintuitive to share incidents reports because it

353
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:05,822
seems like you're sharing a story of failure rather than success.

354
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:09,858
But the truth is, practicing blameless postmortems leads

355
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:13,974
to success because it enables teams to learn from failure and to

356
00:22:14,012 --> 00:22:17,806
improve systems to reduce that prevalence of failure. So framing

357
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:22,246
incidents as learning opportunities with concrete results

358
00:22:22,358 --> 00:22:25,782
and improvements, rather than a personal failure,

359
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:29,494
it also increases morale, which increases employee

360
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:33,626
retention and productivity. One thing we do at pagerduty

361
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:37,338
is we actually schedule all postmortem meetings on a shared calendar,

362
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:41,358
and the calendar is visible to the entire company and anyone

363
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,866
is welcome to join. This gives engineering teams the opportunity

364
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:49,022
to learn from each other on how to practice blamelessness and deeply

365
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:52,914
analyze incident causes. It also makes clear

366
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:56,194
that incidents aren't shameful failures that should be kept

367
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,942
quiet. By sharing learnings from the incident analysis, you help

368
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:03,362
the entire organization learn, not just the effective

369
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:07,234
teams responsible for the remediation. So pagerduty

370
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:10,982
also sends completed postmortems via email to an incidents

371
00:23:11,046 --> 00:23:14,810
reports distribution list that includes all of engineering and product

372
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,266
and support, as well as our incident commanders who may or

373
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:21,626
may not be in one of those departments. And this widens

374
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:25,566
system knowledge for everyone involved in the incidents response process.

375
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:29,898
Information sharing and transparency it also supports an environment

376
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:33,070
that cultivates accountability. A common challenge to

377
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,438
effective postmortems is that after analyzing the incident and creating action items

378
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:41,550
to prevent reoccurrence, information sharing to increase transparency

379
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:45,010
is never done. So I'm just going to talk about some quick tips for success

380
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,694
when youve starting this off. For action items to get done, they have to

381
00:23:48,732 --> 00:23:51,794
have clear owners. So because we're an agile

382
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:55,714
and DevOps shop, the crossfunctional teams responsible for the affected

383
00:23:55,762 --> 00:23:59,670
services are also responsible for implementing improvements

384
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,462
expected to reduce the likelihood of failure. Engineering leadership

385
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:07,414
helps clarify what parts of the system each team owns and sets

386
00:24:07,462 --> 00:24:11,818
expectation for which team owns new development and operational

387
00:24:11,914 --> 00:24:15,966
improvements. Ownership designations they're communicated across

388
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:19,790
the organization so all teams understand who owns what

389
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,854
where ownership gaps can be identified, and we document

390
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:27,326
this information for future reference and new hires.

391
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:31,246
Any uncertainty about ownership of an incident's action items

392
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,962
are discussed in the postmortem meeting with representatives for all

393
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:38,386
teams that may own the action item. So start by setting

394
00:24:38,418 --> 00:24:41,606
a policy for when post mortem action items should be completed. So at

395
00:24:41,628 --> 00:24:45,702
pager duty, our vp of engineering has set the expectation that high

396
00:24:45,756 --> 00:24:49,386
priority action items needed to prevent a sub one from

397
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:53,018
reoccurring should be completed within 15 days

398
00:24:53,104 --> 00:24:57,162
of the incident and action items from a sub two should be addressed within

399
00:24:57,216 --> 00:25:00,506
30 days. It's really important to communicate

400
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:04,186
this expectation to all of engineering and make sure it's

401
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:08,330
documented for future reference. We've also seen improved accountability

402
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,482
for completing action items by involving the leaders,

403
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:14,974
responsible product managers and engineering managers.

404
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:18,494
Those leaders need to be involved because they're

405
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:22,354
prioritizing that team's work in the post mortem meeting. I mean

406
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:26,502
product managers, they're responsible for defining a good customer experience.

407
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:30,402
Incidents cause a poor customer experience, so engage

408
00:25:30,546 --> 00:25:33,846
product managers in postmortem discussions by explaining that

409
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:38,310
it will provide a wider picture of threats to that customer experience and

410
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,042
ideas on how to improve that experience. Doing so, it gives

411
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:45,866
engineering a chance to explain the importance of these action items so that the

412
00:25:45,888 --> 00:25:49,702
product managers will prioritize the work accordingly. And similarly,

413
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:53,066
getting engineering leadership more involved in the postmortem discussion.

414
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:57,470
It gives them a better understanding of system weaknesses to inform

415
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,530
how and where they should invest technical resources.

416
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,378
So sharing this context with the leaders that prioritize the

417
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:08,706
work. It allows them to support the team's effort to

418
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:12,130
quickly complete high priority action items that result

419
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,906
from that incidents analysis. And really, the most important

420
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:20,114
outcome of a post mortem meeting is to gain that buy in for the action

421
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:24,278
plan. So this is an opportunity to discuss proposed action items and

422
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:27,870
brainstorm other options and gain that consensus

423
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,330
among the team leadership.

424
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,154
Sometimes the ROI of proposed action items, it's not great

425
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:37,862
enough to justify the work the post mortem action items

426
00:26:37,926 --> 00:26:41,366
might have shown, so they might need to be delayed

427
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:45,566
for other priorities. The postmortem meeting that's a time to discuss

428
00:26:45,748 --> 00:26:49,470
these difficult decisions and make clear what work will

429
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,818
and will not be done as a result of the expected implications

430
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:57,078
of these choices. And whereas the written postmortem,

431
00:26:57,114 --> 00:27:00,542
it's intended to be shared widely in the organization, the primary

432
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:04,334
audience for the postmortem meeting is the teams directly involved

433
00:27:04,382 --> 00:27:07,826
with the incident. This meeting gives the team a chance to align on

434
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:11,334
what happened and what to do about it, and how they'll communicate about

435
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:14,258
the incidents to internal and external stakeholders.

436
00:27:14,354 --> 00:27:17,598
So participants in this meeting, they might be the incident commander,

437
00:27:17,714 --> 00:27:21,382
maybe any shadowees, service owners and key engineers

438
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:25,226
involved in the incident, engineering managers for impacted system

439
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:28,380
product managers and any customers,

440
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,362
internal or external liaisons. And if

441
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:36,014
not already done by the incident commander, one of the first steps is

442
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:39,566
to create a new and empty postmortem for the incident. Go through

443
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:43,226
the history in slack. So we use slack. So whatever tool you're

444
00:27:43,258 --> 00:27:46,722
using to identify the responders and add them to the page

445
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:49,342
so that they can help populate that postmortem.

446
00:27:49,486 --> 00:27:52,606
Include the roles of incident commander and deputy

447
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:56,142
and scribe as well. And if you're confused about those roles, check out response

448
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:59,794
pagerduty.com, where we break down how the incident response

449
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:03,138
process works at Pagerduty and for some other organizations,

450
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:06,466
youve also want to add a link to the incident call recording,

451
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:10,114
invite stakeholders from related or impacted

452
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:13,402
teams, and then schedule that post mortem meeting for 30 minutes

453
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:17,802
to an hour. Depending on whatever the complexity of that incident was and

454
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:21,478
scheduling the meeting at the beginning of the process, it helps make sure that

455
00:28:21,504 --> 00:28:25,806
that post mortem is completed within the SLA. And so again,

456
00:28:25,908 --> 00:28:29,530
these are some of the people that should attend, service owners, key engineers,

457
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,594
engineering managers, product managers, customer liaisons, an incident

458
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:36,954
commander or a facilitator, and any of the other roles

459
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:40,226
that you may have had during that incident response call. And then you

460
00:28:40,248 --> 00:28:43,886
want to begin by focusing on the timeline. You want to document the facts

461
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:47,506
of what happened during the incident. Avoid evaluating what

462
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:50,946
should or should not have been done and coming to conclusions about what caused

463
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:55,154
the incidents. Present only the facts here and that will help avoid blame

464
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:58,626
and support that deeper analysis. And note

465
00:28:58,658 --> 00:29:02,086
that the incident, it may have actually started before responders became aware

466
00:29:02,118 --> 00:29:06,182
of it and began that response effort. So the timeline

467
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:09,514
includes important changes in status and impact and key

468
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:13,174
actions taken by responders that helps to avoid

469
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:17,070
hindsight bias if you start your timeline at a point before

470
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,606
the incidents happened and work your way forward instead of

471
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:23,178
working your way backwards towards resolution.

472
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:26,882
Also review the incident log and whatever chat tool.

473
00:29:26,936 --> 00:29:30,814
Hopefully it's not email that you're using to find key decisions

474
00:29:30,862 --> 00:29:34,334
that were made and actions taken during the response effort,

475
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:37,574
and include information the team didn't know during

476
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:41,186
the incident that in hindsight you wish you would have known.

477
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:45,542
You can find this additional information by looking at monitoring and logs and

478
00:29:45,596 --> 00:29:47,880
deployments related to affected services.

479
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:52,122
You'll take a deeper look at monitoring during the analysis step,

480
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,702
but start here by adding key events related to the incident,

481
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:59,098
like deploys or customer tickets filed. Maybe it

482
00:29:59,104 --> 00:30:02,698
was a hypothesis being tested during a chaos engineering experiment

483
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:06,574
and include changes to the incident status and the impact to that

484
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:09,274
timeline. And for each item in the timeline,

485
00:30:09,402 --> 00:30:12,734
identify a metric or some third party page where

486
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:16,526
data came from because this helps illustrate each point clearly

487
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:20,418
and it ensures that you remain rooted in fact rather

488
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:23,886
than opinions. So this could be a link to a monitoring graph

489
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:27,598
or a log search. Maybe it was a bunch of tweets, anything that shows the

490
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:31,062
data point that youve trying to illustrate in the timeline. And so

491
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:35,270
just a few tips for the timeline. Stick to the facts, include changes

492
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:39,186
to the incident and then we are going to go to documenting

493
00:30:39,218 --> 00:30:43,382
the impact. Impact should be described from a few perspectives.

494
00:30:43,526 --> 00:30:47,206
How long was the impact visible? In other words, what was the length

495
00:30:47,238 --> 00:30:50,838
of time users or customers were affected? And note

496
00:30:50,854 --> 00:30:54,266
that the length of impact may differ from the length of the response

497
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:57,786
effort. Impact may have started sometime before it was detected

498
00:30:57,818 --> 00:31:01,834
and the incident response began. How many customers were affected?

499
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:05,650
Support may need a list of all affected customers so they can reach out

500
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,282
individually and then maybe how many customers wrote or called

501
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:13,346
support about the incident, what functionality was affected and how

502
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:17,250
severely. You want to quantify impact with a business metric specific

503
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,266
to the product. So for pagerduty this includes like event ingestion and delayed

504
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,598
processing or slow notification delivery. And now that

505
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:28,454
you have an understanding of what happened during the incident, look further back

506
00:31:28,492 --> 00:31:32,038
in time to find the contributing factors that led to the incident.

507
00:31:32,134 --> 00:31:35,974
Technology it's a complex system with a network of relationships

508
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:40,114
from organizational to human to technical, and that's continuously

509
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:43,578
changing. In his paper how complex systems fail,

510
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:46,906
Dr. Richard Cook says that because complex systems

511
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,082
are heavily defended against failure, it is a unique combination

512
00:31:51,146 --> 00:31:54,626
of apparently innocuous failures that join to create a

513
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:57,934
catastrophic failure. Furthermore, because overt

514
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:02,034
failures require multiple faults, attributing a root cause is

515
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:05,554
fundamentally wrong. There's no single root cause of

516
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:09,554
a major failure in complex system, but a combination of contributing factors

517
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:13,186
that together led to that failure. And your goal in analyzing

518
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:16,102
the incidents is not to identify a root cause,

519
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:19,570
but to understand the multiple factors that created an environment

520
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,514
where failure became possible. So Cook also says that the effort to find

521
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,762
a root cause does not reflect an understanding of the system,

522
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:30,022
but rather the cultural need to blame a specific

523
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:33,834
localized forces for events. Blamelessness is essential

524
00:32:33,882 --> 00:32:37,294
for an effective postmortem. An individual's actions should never

525
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:41,018
be considered a root cause. Effective analysis goes deeper

526
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:44,382
than human action in the cases where someone's mistake did

527
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:47,986
contribute to a failure. It's worth anonymizing this in your analysis to

528
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:51,714
avoid attaching blame to an individual. Assume any

529
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:55,150
team member could have made the same mistake. According to Cook,

530
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,790
all practitioner actions are actually gambles, that is,

531
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,434
acts that take place in the face of uncertain outages.

532
00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:06,146
Now on youve analysis, you want to start it by looking at your restoring

533
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:09,814
for the affected services. Search for irregularities for like

534
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:13,578
when sudden spikes or flatlining when the incident began and leading up to the

535
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:17,466
incident. Include any commands or queries you use to look up

536
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:20,762
that data. The graph images or links from your monitoring tool

537
00:33:20,816 --> 00:33:24,174
alongside this analysis so others can see how

538
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:27,774
that data was gathered. This level of analysis will cover the

539
00:33:27,812 --> 00:33:31,166
superficial it's going to uncover the superficial causes of the

540
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:34,786
incident. Next, ask why was the system designed in a way to

541
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:38,146
make this possible? Why did those design decisions seem to

542
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:42,290
be best decisions at the time? And answering these questions

543
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,686
will help you to uncover those contributing

544
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:50,642
factors. And some helpful questions are is this an isolated

545
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:54,754
incident or part of a trend? Was it a specific bug, a failure,

546
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:58,134
something that we anticipated? Or did it uncover a classic issue

547
00:33:58,172 --> 00:34:01,706
we weren't even sure of? Was there work that some team didn't do in the

548
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:04,778
past that contributed to this incident? Were there any similar

549
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:08,138
related incidents in the past? Does this incident demonstrate a

550
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:11,866
larger trend? And will this class of issue get worse as we

551
00:34:11,888 --> 00:34:15,710
continue to grow and scale and use the service? Now, it may not be possible,

552
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:19,466
or as I mentioned before, with the effort to completely eliminate

553
00:34:19,498 --> 00:34:22,846
the possibility of the same incident or similar incident from

554
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:26,894
occurring again. So also consider how can you improve detection

555
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:30,386
and mitigation of future incidents? Do you need better monitoring and

556
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:34,340
alerting around this class of problems so that you can respond faster in the future?

557
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,930
If this class of incident does happen again, how can you decrease the severity

558
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,534
or the duration? Remember to identify any actions that can make

559
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:46,438
your incident response process better too. Go through the incident history

560
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:49,762
to find any to do action items raised during the incident

561
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:53,018
and make sure that those are documented as tickets as well.

562
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:56,854
At this phase, you are only opening tickets. There's no expectation

563
00:34:56,902 --> 00:35:00,406
that tasks will be completed before the postmortem meeting.

564
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:04,174
And so Google writes that postmortem action items to

565
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:07,694
ensure that they're completed, that they should be actionable, specific,

566
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:11,562
and bounded. So with actionable items, you should phrase

567
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:15,266
each item as a sentence starting with a verb. The action should result in a

568
00:35:15,288 --> 00:35:19,010
useful outcome. And for specific you want to define each

569
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,130
action item's scope as narrowly as possible,

570
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,966
making it clear what is and is out of scope. And for bounded,

571
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:30,354
you want to word each action item to indicate how to tell when it's finished,

572
00:35:30,482 --> 00:35:33,986
as opposed to open ended or ongoing tasks.

573
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:38,150
And so here are some ideas for better wording

574
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,978
if you think about poorly worded investigated monitoring for

575
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:45,546
this scenario versus an actionable worded item which

576
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:48,902
is had alerting for all cases where this service returns

577
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:52,394
greater than 1% errors. Next, you want to move on to

578
00:35:52,432 --> 00:35:56,222
external messaging. And the goal of external messaging is to build

579
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:59,806
trust by giving customers enough information about what happened and

580
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:03,866
what you're doing about it, without giving away all your proprietary information about

581
00:36:03,908 --> 00:36:08,126
your technology or your organization. There are parts of your internal analysis

582
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:12,082
that primarily benefit the internal audience, and those don't need to be

583
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:15,886
included in your external postmortem. The external postmortem

584
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:19,254
is a summarized and sanitized version of the information

585
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:22,966
used for the internal postmortem. So some of

586
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:26,454
the components that you want to include with external postmortems are

587
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:29,720
a summary, which is just two to three sentence to summarize what happened,

588
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,026
what happened, so what were those contributing factors and what are we

589
00:36:34,048 --> 00:36:37,450
doing about it? It can be pretty short and sweet, and remember,

590
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,438
it's sanitized from what you would share internally.

591
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:44,326
Now at Pagerduty, we have a community of experienced postmortem

592
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:48,650
writers available to review postmortems for style and content as I messaged,

593
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,494
and this avoids wasted time during the meeting. So we post

594
00:36:52,532 --> 00:36:55,918
a link to our postmortems in slack to receive feedback at

595
00:36:55,924 --> 00:36:59,826
least 24 hours before the meeting is scheduled and some

596
00:36:59,848 --> 00:37:02,740
of the things that we look for are does it provide enough detail?

597
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,846
Rather than just pointing out what went wrong, does it drill down to the underlying

598
00:37:06,878 --> 00:37:10,422
causes of the issue? Does it separated what

599
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:13,826
happened from the how to fix it? Do the proposed action

600
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:17,570
items make sense? Are they well scoped enough? Is the postmortem

601
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,014
understandable and well written? Does the external

602
00:37:21,062 --> 00:37:24,186
message resonate well with customers, or is it likely to

603
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,994
cause outrage? So a few things to do are make

604
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:31,926
sure that the timeline is an accurate representation

605
00:37:32,118 --> 00:37:35,486
of the events, separate the what happened from the

606
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:39,178
how to fix up fix it and you want to write those follow up items

607
00:37:39,194 --> 00:37:42,670
that are again, actionable, specific and bounded.

608
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,894
And then things that you don't want to do is don't use the word outage

609
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:49,726
unless it really was an outage,

610
00:37:49,918 --> 00:37:52,990
accurately reflect the impact of an incident.

611
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,658
Outage is usually too broad of a term to use, and it can lead customers

612
00:37:56,744 --> 00:37:59,826
to think that the product was fully unavailable and likely

613
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:03,206
that wasn't the case. Also, don't change details or events to make

614
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:06,402
things look better. Be honest in your postmortems.

615
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:09,782
Don't name and shame folks. Keep your post mortems blameless.

616
00:38:09,846 --> 00:38:13,494
If someone deployed a change that broke things, it's not their fault.

617
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:17,434
Everyone is collectively responsible for building a system that allowed them

618
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:21,354
to deploy a breaking change and also avoid that concept

619
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:24,954
of human error. Very rarely

620
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:28,138
is that mistake rooted in a human performing an action.

621
00:38:28,234 --> 00:38:31,774
There's often several contributing factors that

622
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:35,742
can and should be addressed. And then also don't point out just

623
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:39,362
what went wrong. Drill down to the underlying causes of the issue

624
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:42,846
and also point out what went right. And so, after youve completed

625
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:46,094
the written postmortem, follow up with a meeting to discuss the incident.

626
00:38:46,142 --> 00:38:49,494
And the purpose of this meeting is to deepen the postmortem analysis through

627
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:53,298
direct communication and to gain buy in for the action items.

628
00:38:53,394 --> 00:38:56,946
You want to send a link to the postmortem document to the meeting attendees

629
00:38:56,978 --> 00:39:00,406
at least 24 hours before the meeting. The postmortem may

630
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:03,702
not be complete at that time when it's sent to the attendees,

631
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:07,546
it should be finished before the meeting, but it's still worth sending an

632
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:10,714
incomplete postmortem to meeting attendees in advance so that they can start

633
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:14,682
reading through the document. This is an opportunity to discuss proposed

634
00:39:14,746 --> 00:39:17,598
action items and brainstorm other options. And remember,

635
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:20,942
gain that continuous among leadership. As I mentioned,

636
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:24,606
the ROI of proposed action items. It may not justify the

637
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,826
work right? This post meeting mortem meeting is a

638
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:31,442
time to discuss that and then one other thing is, if you

639
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:34,562
can develop good facilitators, that's really

640
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:38,098
helpful in the postmortem meeting. The facilitator role in

641
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:41,398
the postmortem meeting, it's different from the other participants. So you may

642
00:39:41,404 --> 00:39:45,270
be used to a certain level of participation in meetings, but that will change

643
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,394
if you take on the role of a facilitator. The facilitator isn't

644
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:53,082
voicing their own ideas during the meeting. They encourage the group to speak

645
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:56,602
up and they keep that discussion on track. And this requires enough

646
00:39:56,656 --> 00:40:00,586
cognitive load that's difficult to perform when you're attempting

647
00:40:00,618 --> 00:40:04,686
to also contribute personal thoughts to the decision. For a

648
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:08,042
successful postmortem meeting, it's helpful to have a designated

649
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:12,346
facilitator that's not trying to participate in that discussion.

650
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:16,286
So good facilitators tend to have a high level of emotional intelligence.

651
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:20,114
That means that they can easily read nonverbal cues to understand how people

652
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:23,550
are feeling. And they use this sense to cultivate an environment

653
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,294
where everyone is comfortable speaking. Agile coaches

654
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:31,022
and project managers, they are often skilled facilitators.

655
00:40:31,086 --> 00:40:35,138
At pager duty, we have a guild of confident facilitators who coach individuals

656
00:40:35,234 --> 00:40:38,498
interested in learning how to facilitate.

657
00:40:38,594 --> 00:40:42,620
So some of the things that the facilitators do is they keep people

658
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,046
on topic. They might need to interrupt to remind the team of meeting

659
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:50,454
goals, or ask if it's value to continue with this topic

660
00:40:50,502 --> 00:40:54,006
or if it can be taken offline. They can also time box agenda

661
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:57,214
items, and once the time is done, they can vote. If you want to keep

662
00:40:57,252 --> 00:41:00,798
talking about it or if we should move on, they also keep

663
00:41:00,884 --> 00:41:04,606
one person from dominating. So as a facilitator, you want to say up

664
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,826
from that. Participate from everyone is important. You want to

665
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:11,566
explain what the roles and responsibilities of your job as a facilitator

666
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:15,218
are so that they won't be offended if you tell them to stop talking

667
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:18,806
or if you ask somebody to speak up and you want to pay attention to

668
00:41:18,828 --> 00:41:21,270
how much people are talking throughout the meeting,

669
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,334
some facilitator tips are, oh, I wasn't able to hear what person a

670
00:41:25,372 --> 00:41:29,174
was saying. Let's give them a moment. Really. The facilitator is

671
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:32,390
acting as a mediator to call out when people are getting interrupted.

672
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,006
The facilitator is also encouraging, continuous,

673
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,498
and they see that if a team member hasn't said anything, you can

674
00:41:39,504 --> 00:41:43,134
get them to contribute by saying things like, let's go around the room and hear

675
00:41:43,172 --> 00:41:47,070
from everyone, or what stood out to you so far, or what else?

676
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,294
What we need to consider I do want to point out again that

677
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:55,102
there's no single root cause of failure because systems

678
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:59,246
are complex. So remember that during this meeting we're

679
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:02,734
not looking for one single person or a single root

680
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:06,354
cause. We're looking for all of those contributing factors.

681
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,962
And it's really important to go back to avoiding that blame,

682
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:14,678
to not use the term root cause.

683
00:42:14,844 --> 00:42:17,654
And so practice makes perfect.

684
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:21,194
Use your post mortem practice even

685
00:42:21,232 --> 00:42:25,526
for mock incidents, for chaos engineering complete postmortems

686
00:42:25,558 --> 00:42:28,954
at the end of every one of those experiments. And so a few

687
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:32,478
of the key takeaways here are that post mortems should

688
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:35,934
drive a culture of continuous improvement and help you to understand those

689
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:39,694
systematic failures that led to the incident. Blame is

690
00:42:39,732 --> 00:42:44,378
bad. It disincentivize knowledge sharing. Individual actions

691
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:48,062
should never be considered a root cause. There's no single

692
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:51,614
root cause, just contributing factors. And if you

693
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,010
would like to learn more, you can head over to postmortems

694
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,646
pagerduty.com and learn more about our

695
00:42:58,668 --> 00:43:01,814
process. There's also some templates in there, and thank

696
00:43:01,852 --> 00:43:02,820
you all for your time.
