00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,902
Welcome all to my presentation at Conf fourty two today.

2
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:42,822
What I want to talk to you about are the four reasons comp

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,994
1234, why digital transformations usually fail,

4
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:50,526
and how you can be successful. My name

5
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:54,026
is Zach Gardner. If you didn't already know, somehow I'm

6
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:57,614
the chief architect here at Keyhole Software. I get to work

7
00:00:57,652 --> 00:01:01,102
with some amazing people day in and day out that help

8
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:05,390
solve real world challenges for real world applications.

9
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,250
We don't do embedded software, we don't do

10
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,394
guided missiles, none of that stuff. What I do is

11
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:17,426
I help companies digitally transform by

12
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:20,582
focusing on user centric applications. Now,

13
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:24,214
what that means to everyone is completely different. What that means for a hospital is

14
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:27,818
different than what it means for a utility company. But I've had the privilege and

15
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:31,942
the pleasure of helping different companies figure. But what digital

16
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,834
transformation means to them and how they can use that to

17
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:39,130
empower their customers. Full disclosure,

18
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,734
I'm not here to sell you a product. I'm not here to sell you

19
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:45,854
anything in particular. I'm here because I care about this

20
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:49,882
subject passionately, and I think that we as software practitioners

21
00:01:49,946 --> 00:01:53,534
have really done a disservice of explaining what digital

22
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:56,862
transformation is and how it can positively

23
00:01:56,926 --> 00:02:00,654
impact the lives of real people. This presentation

24
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:03,938
is a compilation of the things that I've learned. After doing this

25
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,494
two or three times, I kind of lose count on how many times

26
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:10,774
it's been. And what I hope you'll get out of it is

27
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:14,054
to understand how you can, I guess, not have

28
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,446
a successful digital transformation, but also how you

29
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:20,874
can have a successful one. So with

30
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:24,714
that, let's get started. Now, it seems like every

31
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:28,394
couple of years there's a topic that comes along that simply everyone is

32
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:31,942
talking about. Chat GPT seems to be the flavor

33
00:02:32,006 --> 00:02:35,834
of the day. A couple of years ago it was microservices,

34
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:39,294
before that it was service oriented architecture. The list

35
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:42,078
goes on and on. In the past couple of years,

36
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:46,398
what we on the keyhole software side have noticed is that digital transformation

37
00:02:46,494 --> 00:02:50,830
seems to be on the top of everyone's minds, all the way from the CEOs,

38
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,302
the CIOs, the CTOs, down to the managers,

39
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:57,298
the directors, the people leading software development teams.

40
00:02:57,394 --> 00:03:00,886
And you can tell just from these clips that the

41
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:05,362
term digital transformation is becoming more and more ubiquitous.

42
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:09,514
Now. The industry has taken notice and

43
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:13,322
it seems like everyone is offering a service on

44
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:17,014
how to digitally transform your applications, how to digitally transform

45
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:20,606
your business. I can go on. And I can go on.

46
00:03:20,628 --> 00:03:23,120
I actually have more slides that I didn't include in this.

47
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:28,334
The first reason why a digital transformation do

48
00:03:28,372 --> 00:03:31,870
not succeed is because there is a fallacy

49
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,660
in how a lot of companies approach it.

50
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,186
There is no single tool that will allow you

51
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:42,578
to digitally transform your business. There's just not.

52
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:46,322
Every single business is unique. Every single business

53
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:50,022
has very specific constraints, specific things that it's good at,

54
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:53,526
things that it's not so good at. And even within a particular

55
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:57,126
industry or sector, one company to another can

56
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:00,730
be radically different. They can be neck and neck, number one and number two,

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,442
and they could do things entirely differently. How do you have

58
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:08,182
a single product that you can buy off the shelf

59
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,434
and customize to any degree that will somehow

60
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:14,762
work between these two and digitally transform

61
00:04:14,826 --> 00:04:17,982
it? If someone tells you that,

62
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:21,978
it's because they're trying to sell you something. And what's funny

63
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:26,466
is that this fallacy is not specific

64
00:04:26,568 --> 00:04:30,194
to this particular kind of transformation. In the years

65
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:33,922
that I have been the software development field, I have seen these

66
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:36,550
trends become, and I have seen these trends go.

67
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,170
But they all share one interesting characteristic,

68
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,694
the fact that there is always one particular way of

69
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,278
looking at the world that will somehow make everything better.

70
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:52,438
The oldest, and probably the first that I really dealt with was SOA,

71
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:56,618
to where we were going to have these beautiful services that completely

72
00:04:56,704 --> 00:05:00,454
modeled our business. And all these services were going to interact

73
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,854
with each other, and somehow that was going to allow us to

74
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:07,214
compose applications on top of them and not have to

75
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:11,166
write any custom code anymore. Well, I think we

76
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:14,594
all know how that one went. The next one that I got to

77
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,220
was an enterprise service bus. Where? Well,

78
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,380
from SOA, we kind of figured out that there are all these different

79
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,586
business rules that need to be in the middle, and we

80
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:29,314
need to have some way of orchestrating calls from here

81
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:32,998
to here to here. We put the smarts out of the edges and

82
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:36,150
we put it into the pipes. Well, we all know how that went.

83
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,442
It got to be too complicated, and we didn't understand it anymore.

84
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:43,546
Well, what did we do next? We have microservices, and this

85
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:46,570
is the trend that we are seeing. Not to say that any of these

86
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,266
approaches that I've talked about so far are inherently wrong, in much

87
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:54,106
the same way that a hammer or a saw can't

88
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:57,358
be wrong. It can be applied to the wrong job.

89
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:01,326
It can be used improperly. But it in and of itself is

90
00:06:01,348 --> 00:06:05,122
not necessarily wrong. It is how you apply it to

91
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:08,638
a particular problem. That's the part that I think we're

92
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:11,838
getting wrong in a lot of these cases. So with microservices,

93
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:15,346
we all know that these are independent services that

94
00:06:15,368 --> 00:06:18,310
can go in and out of production at different cadences.

95
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,066
Theoretically, they could be written in completely different languages,

96
00:06:22,178 --> 00:06:25,378
though kind of behind the curtain. I don't know if I've

97
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:28,498
ever actually seen that happen at any large organization.

98
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:32,102
It typically is pretty homogeneous, but that's a different presentation

99
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:36,074
at a different comp 42 for a different day. So we have

100
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:39,446
all these different services. They're talking to each other and they're

101
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,426
going, and they can communicate asynchronously.

102
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,578
They have high cohesion and low coupling.

103
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:48,926
Well, what happens is usually one

104
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:53,502
of these services goes down. We didn't properly plan for failure cases,

105
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:57,122
or what can also happen too, is we realize that our business

106
00:06:57,176 --> 00:07:01,038
services, we've defined them a little bit too granularly.

107
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:05,426
So we actually need to combine microservices together in

108
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:09,046
and of itself. This is not a failure of microservices. What it

109
00:07:09,068 --> 00:07:12,454
is a failure of in all the three that I've mentioned up to this

110
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:16,200
point, is the fallacy that somehow there's one particular

111
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,806
approach that will help us solve our problems. And it's a lie

112
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:24,874
that we keep telling ourselves over and over again, that even

113
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,010
though we've seen this never work before in the past,

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,766
we felt it. We have scar tissue. In some cases,

115
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:35,566
I'm talking but abortly, but we have scar tissue. We remember what it

116
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,520
is like. We always tell ourselves this lie, that sometimes

117
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,550
this new thing that I'm trying, it will be different. That if I just purchase

118
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,722
this one product, it will digitally transform me,

119
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:52,546
even though I have never seen that happen in the past.

120
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:55,220
And we tell ourselves, this time is going to be different.

121
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,200
That's reason number two. This time will not be different.

122
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,662
You are going to wake up exactly the same

123
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:09,122
team, exactly the same people with exactly the same idiosyncrasies,

124
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:12,774
the same worldviews. Everything about the teams that

125
00:08:12,812 --> 00:08:16,426
you will be working digitally transform, everything about your customers that

126
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:20,310
you are trying to transform, they will be exactly the same.

127
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,590
This time will not be different. So what do we do?

128
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,150
We have to plan accordingly.

129
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,534
Here's the fun part. How do you do that?

130
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:35,214
How do you plan for a digital transformation where,

131
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:38,722
you know you're going to need to do something different than you're doing right

132
00:08:38,776 --> 00:08:42,690
now? You're going to need to figure out different ways of thinking about things

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,402
that maybe you haven't thought about in the past? Well, first of all,

134
00:08:46,536 --> 00:08:50,578
you need to define what a digital transformation is. And honestly,

135
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:54,054
if you've never jumped to it before, it's kind of like that

136
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:57,826
first year of marriage where raise your hand if you made a few mistakes during

137
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:01,542
your first year of marriage. I am very culpable

138
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:05,034
of that. You kind of have to figure it out as you go.

139
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:08,794
But we can look

140
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:13,166
for how other companies that have gone before us have done things and not

141
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:16,846
always emulate exactly what they've done, but try

142
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:20,126
to figure out why it is that they did the things that

143
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:23,626
they did, why they chose that path, and what

144
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:26,900
made them successful. And from that,

145
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,150
let's work backwards. Let's figure out how it works in our particular industry,

146
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,220
our particular business, our particular problem. So the first case study

147
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,654
that I want to bring up is DHL. They did

148
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:43,846
market research on their customers, and they figured out

149
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,622
what made their customers choose them instead

150
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:51,434
of one of their competitors. They tried a couple different things. They saw

151
00:09:51,472 --> 00:09:55,254
some things that worked, some things that didn't work, the basics

152
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:58,102
of agile. In any given organization,

153
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:01,350
you kind of got to figure out what works and what doesn't work. One of

154
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,054
the things that they discovered was that people like to know where their

155
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:08,794
packages are, which, as someone who occasionally orders

156
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:13,040
things through DLL, excuse me, DHL, I can attest to,

157
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,394
but what people don't like is having to talk to

158
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:20,946
other people. We live in a digital age. We like to be able to

159
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,998
do everything that we possibly can on our phones.

160
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:27,986
I have very a couple of members of my family that if they

161
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:31,766
could get away with never talking to anyone other than their immediate family, they'd be

162
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:35,446
totally happy. So let's stop saying these people are wrong

163
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:39,538
and let's embrace it. Let's figure. But how to bring them into the fold?

164
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:42,934
How do we engage these kind of people? Because they're becoming

165
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:46,394
more and more ubiquitous. What DHL found was

166
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:49,626
if they create a chat bot, something on their website,

167
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,902
it can be both on desktop as well as mobile.

168
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:56,474
And that's an important point, because they found out most of their customers actually preferred

169
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,606
mobile. They could have the chat bot interact with

170
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:04,078
the user. The user could tell it, here's my shipping number. Can you

171
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:08,034
tell me where my package is? And it could even tell them where their

172
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:11,342
package was. They can schedule on demand deliveries

173
00:11:11,406 --> 00:11:14,914
where you could say, oh, you're projecting it to deliver it on this

174
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:18,582
date, but I'm actually going to be out of town. Can you maybe deliver it

175
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,214
same day next week? Or is there any way you can move that delivery day

176
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:26,050
up? They could even have people, the chat bot,

177
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,298
generate QR codes for labels so that they don't

178
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,326
have to go to the post office, they don't have to take extra steps.

179
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:35,978
You know what's funny is when they did that, they found their customer

180
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:39,930
satisfaction scores increased and their

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,642
profits increased. People had a more pleasurable

182
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:46,826
time dealing with this new digitally

183
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:50,254
transformed DHL than they did with the previous ones. Now they're still

184
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,886
experimenting with new things. They're actually one of the companies that are really

185
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:56,958
on the forefront of using blockchain,

186
00:11:57,054 --> 00:12:01,054
which in their particular domain, it makes a lot of sense. They have packages

187
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:04,798
that go all over the place, and having an immutable ledger

188
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:08,386
of where these current packages are, that's a pretty

189
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,598
compelling use case. But not every company is

190
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:15,090
going to be able to get away with a chat, but it really depends.

191
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,398
This is kind of a sneak peek of what I'll be talking about in a

192
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,100
little bit. It really depends on who your customers are,

193
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,386
where they are, what they want, and what you can do to

194
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:28,714
meet in the middle. Now, the second company

195
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,618
in this case study is Disney. They have done

196
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:36,330
a ton of work in the digital transformation sphere,

197
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,934
and I can attest to it. I was at Disneyland at the end of

198
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:43,642
2021. There were so many new offerings

199
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:47,490
that we almost had to find guides online to figure

200
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,930
out how to use all these different features, all these different

201
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,370
apps just to get in there and get in the park.

202
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,274
We found good tips about making sure that we had battery packs

203
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:01,826
and solar chargers and logging

204
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:05,158
into the same accounts ahead of time. Genie is one

205
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:08,566
of their best enhancements that they've ever done because it allowed us

206
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:12,034
as consumers to plan our day. We could say,

207
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,570
well, we know we have two little kids,

208
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,486
so they're going to get tired around noon or 01:00

209
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,646
so we're going to have to go back to the hotel. So let's figure out

210
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:25,486
how much walking we can do in the morning and what are

211
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:29,310
the rides that are closest to us that have the lowest wait

212
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,618
time? Because they were seven and

213
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:37,826
three at the time, my daughters, and we knew that

214
00:13:37,848 --> 00:13:41,780
they would get bored really quickly if we were standing in a line.

215
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,826
Disney spent enough time to figure out that

216
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:49,766
that has one of the critical features that that was built into

217
00:13:49,948 --> 00:13:53,842
the mvp. I'm sure that they have a huge laundry

218
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:57,906
list of things that are on their backlog that they could have implementing,

219
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:01,514
but because they understood their customers, they went through

220
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:05,494
and they only implemented things that were the absolute most critical

221
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:10,102
that would provide the best value. Disney, along with other digital

222
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:13,406
transformation features, they actually have a program that not

223
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:17,182
a lot of people know about where their executives have to spend time

224
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:21,342
every single year dressed up has a cast member, so you never

225
00:14:21,396 --> 00:14:25,374
know if the person that you're taking a picture next to that's in a goofy

226
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:28,446
suit. I mean, not like Goofy has in silly,

227
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:31,998
but goofy as in Goofy, the character

228
00:14:32,174 --> 00:14:36,418
that might be a vice president or a senior vice president.

229
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,894
They have to go and they have to live in the lives of

230
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:43,558
the people that they serve. They get to interact with the customers. They have

231
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:48,214
to stay in character all day. They get to really understand what

232
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:51,958
that experience is. Now, not every organization

233
00:14:52,054 --> 00:14:55,260
has the luxury of doing that, and that's totally fine.

234
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,354
There is one, however, near and dear to the heart

235
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:02,750
of a lot of people that I work with, because they get gasoline from there

236
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,962
and they get pizza from there is Casey's.

237
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,934
Casey's, if you haven't noticed, has gone through a rebranding and

238
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:13,426
they're looking holistically at all the different aspects of their

239
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:17,154
business. And there are two things that they found in

240
00:15:17,192 --> 00:15:20,238
particular that apply to a digital transformation.

241
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:24,734
The first is that they had a lot of different systems

242
00:15:24,862 --> 00:15:28,018
that tracked their customers and none

243
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:31,446
of these systems were talking to each other. So they

244
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:34,630
drew a line in the sand. They said, we need

245
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,862
one particular platform, whatever it is,

246
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:41,402
where all of this transformation is going to be gathered, so that we can run

247
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:44,858
reports off of it, so that the light of the people that need to

248
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:48,970
do analytics and business intelligence aren't so painful.

249
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,866
They chose Salesforce, and I'm not being paid by Salesforce to

250
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:57,038
say this. I'll just say it's a very popular tool that I've seen a lot

251
00:15:57,044 --> 00:16:00,478
of different organizations that I've personally worked with use for this particular

252
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:04,354
type of digital transformation. There's other ways of doing it.

253
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:08,258
You could have single pane of glass applications where even if

254
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,922
you have an EMR and an ERP and

255
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:15,678
a CMS, they all tie together and they all appear to the

256
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:19,266
user as one particular, very unique, very atomic

257
00:16:19,298 --> 00:16:22,534
application. Even though under the covers it might be

258
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:25,190
retrieving data, it might be sending data,

259
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,366
it has that layer of abstraction that allows us as humans

260
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,634
to focus on one thing and one thing only,

261
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:36,186
and leaves it to the technology to figure out how to do

262
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:40,026
this kind of reconciliation. The second thing that

263
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:43,360
they learned is that once they had all this information,

264
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,454
what are the things that their customers really care about? You know

265
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:50,750
what people at Casey's really like even more

266
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,782
than gas that is cheap, they really like

267
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:58,242
the pizza. I can't tell you how many times we have gone,

268
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,530
and this is not an advertisement for Casey's.

269
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,938
It's totally not. I'm not being paid by them, but they want to send me

270
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:07,726
some bitcoin. I'm not going to complain how many times people

271
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:10,850
have gone there and raved about the breakfast pizza.

272
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,894
That pizza in particular has a ton of love.

273
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:17,810
So how can they lean into that? They don't need to diversify.

274
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,110
They don't need to go into all the other pizza derivations

275
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,506
like calzones or hot pockets. But how do

276
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:27,686
they maximize on people's love of Casey's

277
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:31,418
pizza? You know what they did? They came out with a triple

278
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:34,894
pepperoni pizza. Now, you might not

279
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:38,702
think that's a digital transformation, but it is

280
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:42,442
because they were using technology to figure

281
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:45,330
out how to transform their business.

282
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,278
And the insights and the analytics that they gained

283
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:52,686
from having that single pane of glass allowed

284
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:55,750
them to increase their revenue.

285
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,710
And here's the fun part. In all those three examples,

286
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,826
you'll notice I didn't name one particular director,

287
00:18:05,938 --> 00:18:09,254
I didn't name one vice president, I didn't name one CTO,

288
00:18:09,302 --> 00:18:12,780
one CEO as the rock star.

289
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,602
A digital transformation, yes, I will

290
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:20,038
agree, has to start from the top, be agreed

291
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:23,614
to. This is our new priority, full stop.

292
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:27,086
We need to figure out how to do this, and it

293
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:30,702
has to be implemented on every single level below.

294
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:34,260
But when you get to the very, very last level,

295
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,414
that is where the digital transformation is actually felt.

296
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:42,594
So it's sort of a paradox. The CEO and

297
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:45,954
all the leadership has to agree this is what we're going to do.

298
00:18:46,152 --> 00:18:49,734
But the people that are actually at the center of

299
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:53,158
a digital transformation are not the people at the top.

300
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:57,414
It's the people at the bottom, so to speak. It's the

301
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:01,226
customers. The end user is the star

302
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,746
of the digital transformation. Because every business no

303
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:08,710
better if you're in b to b, b to c if you're in fintech,

304
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,590
if you're in web three, if you're in AI. We're only

305
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,806
here because there is an end user that has a

306
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:19,214
problem, and they are willing to pay us to solve that

307
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:22,302
problem for them. So we need to,

308
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:25,826
as an industry, stop thinking about ourselves as these

309
00:19:25,928 --> 00:19:29,714
amazing people that have been gifted from on high, that are

310
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,054
allowing people to communicate in new and exciting

311
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:37,558
ways. No, the end user, the customer,

312
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,402
the person that is actually using your software,

313
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:43,974
is the one that you need to be focused on, and you need to be

314
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:48,214
borderline obsessed with learning, has many things

315
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:51,690
as you can about these people, about what it is that they want,

316
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,386
about probably what it is that they don't want, about what you do better

317
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:59,626
than all your other competitors, and you can use technology to

318
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:03,562
do that. That is the heart of a digital

319
00:20:03,626 --> 00:20:06,942
transformation, you can do it in many, many different

320
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:10,560
ways. Probably the most popular way is through user experience.

321
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,334
You can go through, and this is an investigative

322
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:18,014
report that Forbes did. For every dollar

323
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:21,730
that you spend on learning about user experience,

324
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,326
this could be in reasons, this could be in write alongs,

325
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:29,250
this could be any number of different ways that you're learning about users.

326
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,680
But every dollar that you spend in user experience,

327
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,994
it's a hundred to one return. I mean, you'd be silly

328
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:40,698
not to do it. Now, in the three examples that

329
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:43,210
I gave previously, DHL,

330
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,622
Disney, Casey's, they're all in different sectors.

331
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:51,262
They've all done completely different things. They all have potentially different

332
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,382
customers. But they

333
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:58,334
found at the very core of it, the fact that the customer

334
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:01,818
is the one that truly drives

335
00:21:01,914 --> 00:21:05,982
their innovation, and they are the ones that are getting into the customer's

336
00:21:06,046 --> 00:21:10,050
head, figuring out where it is they need their business to go.

337
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,426
Software, as much as we don't want to

338
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:16,594
admit it, it is a game of catch up. We are always going to be

339
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:20,006
behind the ball. We can try to figure out where the

340
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,270
industry is going, but we are never going to get in front of the business.

341
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,646
So let's stop telling ourselves the lie that we will

342
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:30,726
somehow get in front and instead think about what

343
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,058
are some of the different ways that we can embrace that. What are some of

344
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:37,226
the different tools that we could use to get into the

345
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:41,370
heads of our users. Write alongs are honestly my favorite.

346
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,598
If you ask any software developer what their favorite part of the process

347
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:49,086
is, I can almost guarantee it's going

348
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:53,134
to be the times when you've gotten to sit with a user that

349
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:56,722
is using what you're producing. We have

350
00:21:56,776 --> 00:22:00,606
metaphorical blood, sweat and tears in the applications

351
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:04,130
that we build. We spend hours of our lives. We spend time away

352
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,390
from the people that we love the most, our families.

353
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,222
Unless you have the privilege of working from home. My two kids,

354
00:22:11,276 --> 00:22:14,738
I mean, it sounds like a war is happening when I'm

355
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:17,446
at home, so I have to work from an office just to get any work

356
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:20,266
done. But even for those of you that work at home, you still have to

357
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:23,642
focus. You're taking time away from the people that you love to

358
00:22:23,696 --> 00:22:27,162
work on an application. You're sitting behind an ide

359
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:31,054
for 30, 40, 50 hours a week. You care

360
00:22:31,252 --> 00:22:35,214
deeply about the products that you deliver and being

361
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:39,486
able to see someone use it, being able to see someone delighted or

362
00:22:39,588 --> 00:22:42,986
see someone frustrated. There's a level of empathy

363
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:47,106
that we need to tap into as software developers and software practitioners that

364
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:50,654
we aren't and doing ride alongs is one of my favorite.

365
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,900
Carmax actually does this really well.

366
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:57,646
They do studies where they have their development

367
00:22:57,678 --> 00:23:01,126
teams and everyone sort of sit and just go on mute and

368
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:05,222
let the end users talk. But what it is that they like and

369
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:09,094
what it is that they don't like now there is the potential for a Rashimon

370
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:13,014
effect where everyone can have completely different interpretations

371
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,806
about what it is that the users liked and what they didn't. And that's

372
00:23:16,838 --> 00:23:20,506
okay. Software is great. Not when it's a

373
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:23,806
lone wolf developing in their basement encoding all through

374
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:27,578
the night with too many red bulls or that new panera enhanced

375
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:31,338
lemonade that has 1200 grams of caffeine.

376
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:35,074
No, it's done by a team. And so even if you

377
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:38,994
have conflicting views, that's fine, embrace it.

378
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:43,378
Figure. But how you can get to the root of what the user was actually

379
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:47,494
talking about. And there is no one single role that

380
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:51,170
is responsible for this. I'm a firm believer

381
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,122
that the earlier you can have software development product owners

382
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:58,694
and architects and be has involved in the process, the better the project

383
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,506
is ultimately going to be. But no matter where you involve them

384
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:05,706
in the process, it's something that we all have

385
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:09,818
to do. It is 2023, as I speak to you. We have

386
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:13,870
rovers going around on Mars. This is something that we can do.

387
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,062
This is not rocket science. This is extremely simple. It just

388
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:21,950
has to be prioritized. And we have to understand that

389
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,870
a user is at the heart of everything that we do.

390
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,186
There's many tools, there's many techniques, if you've seen the slides that have

391
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,626
been going on as I'm talking. But at the end of the day,

392
00:24:32,728 --> 00:24:37,030
it's the software development team that is the one that is responsible

393
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,758
for delivering the digital transformation. It has

394
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:44,354
to be prioritized. Don't get me wrong, it's the development

395
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:49,154
team that actually does the work. And this unfortunately

396
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:52,422
is the fourth reason why I've seen

397
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:56,410
digital transformations not work. So you have the wrong people

398
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,246
on the bus if you have not to pick

399
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:04,254
on them. Managers that have been in the business for 2025,

400
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:08,094
30 years, maybe they grew up as being

401
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:11,438
developers on a mainframe. And their entire

402
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:14,666
mental model is revolved around the mainframe.

403
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:18,386
The mainframe and the mainframe, if you talk to them, and all they

404
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:21,460
can talk about are the glory days of the as 400,

405
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,814
they may not be the right people on the bus

406
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:29,670
because what we're talking about with the digital transformation goes

407
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,746
beyond any particular software stack, it goes beyond

408
00:25:33,858 --> 00:25:37,682
any particular language, it goes beyond even any particular SDLC

409
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,970
be it safe or agile or scrum or waterfall.

410
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,522
It goes back to what we're doing here.

411
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:48,778
It goes back to why we are even here. We are here

412
00:25:48,944 --> 00:25:52,702
to serve an end user. If we don't understand

413
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:55,614
who that end user is, if we don't care if we think that the end

414
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:58,590
user is at best an inconvenience,

415
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,286
we got the wrong people on the bus.

416
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:06,222
So we really need to take a hard look at what are the strengths

417
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:09,906
and understand what are the weaknesses. What are

418
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:13,490
the mental models of everyone on those low level,

419
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,554
I say low level closest to the client teams,

420
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:21,862
and if we have people on there that maybe

421
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:25,174
their mental model can't be stretched to

422
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:28,778
understand what we're doing, we might need to have some difficult

423
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:31,850
conversations. Now, in any large organization,

424
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,186
there's inertia. Inertia, I would honestly say,

425
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:39,322
is another word for culture. This has always

426
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:43,594
been the way that we're going to do things, and any derivation

427
00:26:43,642 --> 00:26:46,880
thereof is not allowed. People,

428
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,686
we kind of get in a groove. We like to do things the same way.

429
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:53,870
You talk to someone who's been developing software for 30 years,

430
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,954
chances are at around year ten or 15, they found a way that they like

431
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:01,106
to do it, and that's going to be how they want to do it from

432
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:05,150
here on out. When you do a digital transformation,

433
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,394
you have to leave that kind of childish mentality behind. I say childish

434
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:13,560
because I have that mentality sometimes too, so I totally get it.

435
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,318
You might have to get the wrong people off the bus,

436
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:20,330
and you might have to get the right people on the bus.

437
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,898
Now, no matter what it is you choose to do,

438
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:27,274
I can guarantee you that it's not going to be easy.

439
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:30,730
But once you get the people that are

440
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,286
not going to move you forward off the bus,

441
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:37,982
and once you get those people that are going to help you,

442
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:42,046
the people that are going to be obsessed about who your clients are,

443
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:45,650
the people that are going to spend night and day thinking about

444
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,540
what are the things that really work well and what are the things that

445
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,242
don't work well. When you have people that truly care, that have

446
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:58,066
an enormous amount of empathy for your end users,

447
00:27:58,258 --> 00:28:02,118
you're going to find that almost everything else

448
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:05,830
will sort of take care of itself. So, to recap,

449
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,874
when you hear digital transformation, don't buy into

450
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:14,666
the hype. Don't just look at what

451
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:18,826
other people are doing. Don't just look at what other tools people are doing

452
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:23,262
and think that if you somehow purchase those tools, you yourself will

453
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:26,798
be the rock star of the show, because you're not.

454
00:28:26,964 --> 00:28:30,734
Because if you're doing a digital transformation for yourself,

455
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:34,306
you will never be as successful as if

456
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:38,754
you focus on who the truly important people of

457
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:42,498
the digital transformation are, because it's your customers,

458
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:46,466
it's your people. And until you can get the wrong people

459
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:50,086
off the bus, get the right people on the

460
00:28:50,108 --> 00:28:53,554
bus, you're always going to be hitting up against that inertia

461
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:57,014
day after day after day. So we have to, from the

462
00:28:57,052 --> 00:29:01,126
top, understand that this is going to be a priority.

463
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:04,762
Make it clear constantly, possibly over

464
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:08,582
communicate the fact that this is now a priority.

465
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:12,502
We need to embrace the fact that people are on mobile devices.

466
00:29:12,646 --> 00:29:16,046
We need to embrace the fact that our customers want us to do things that

467
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:19,802
we're currently not doing. And if we don't, our competitors

468
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:23,314
are going to do it better than we are. Once you

469
00:29:23,352 --> 00:29:26,434
get to that state of customer

470
00:29:26,552 --> 00:29:29,666
nirvana where you are constantly thinking

471
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:33,906
about what is their life like, what process

472
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:37,734
can I solve for them? It doesn't always have to be technical. As I

473
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:41,574
mentioned with the example with Casey's having a pizza with

474
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:46,070
not one, not two, but three different types of pepperoni,

475
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,074
that kind of insight, that kind of knowledge, that increase in

476
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:53,786
revenue was only possible because they had

477
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:57,274
a digital transformation that allowed them to see it,

478
00:29:57,392 --> 00:30:00,874
to see it so clearly that they could go out and reach it

479
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:04,094
and potentially taste it. I haven't had one

480
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:06,538
yet, but from what I hear, they're fantastic.

481
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:10,478
So again, my name is Zach Gardner. I'm the

482
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:13,726
chief architect here at Keyhole Software. I've helped two,

483
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:17,314
three organizations with their digital transformation. I've seen

484
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:20,914
it go well. I've seen it go not so well. I hope you found this

485
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:24,770
presentation insightful. I know I've had a lot of fun delivering it,

486
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,082
but I need your feedback. So scan the QR code,

487
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:31,110
let me know what are the things that I'm doing well.

488
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,886
What are the things that I need to work on? And if

489
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:38,726
you agree with me, scan the QR code. Let me know if you disagree with

490
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:43,914
me. I also want to know as well, because there

491
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:47,466
is not enough time in the day. I wish there were more than

492
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:51,134
24 hours, but at last there is not. And our

493
00:30:51,172 --> 00:30:54,334
customers, we are real people. I am

494
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:57,280
a customer and I am also a provider of software services.

495
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,106
I want to help solve people's process through software.

496
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:05,806
I think it is such a unique opportunity that we have and

497
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:08,706
a lot of these other presentations at Conf fourty two that you're going to be

498
00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:12,386
listening to, they kind of touch on this. Software is

499
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:15,714
one of those unique fields that allows us to

500
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:19,698
do things that we thought potentially were impossible. We can scale

501
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:23,554
solutions to business problems to be able to solve people's

502
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:27,474
problems while we sleep and as far as I know there's very few

503
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:30,698
other fields unless it's the building of roads and the

504
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:34,522
building of buildings that can anywhere close to

505
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:38,726
how tactile and how tangible

506
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:42,234
we can get with these solutions to our problems and allow

507
00:31:42,272 --> 00:31:45,626
them to scale and we owe it not just to ourselves

508
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:49,246
and honestly not just to our bottom lines because if you're thinking like that

509
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:52,622
you're going to fail. We owe it to our

510
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:56,190
customers, we owe it to the real users to

511
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,206
stop thinking about things in the way that we used to

512
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:04,174
just because there's momentum and truly start to

513
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:07,366
understand what it is and where they need us to

514
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:11,554
go what are their problems and how can we provide those solutions

515
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:15,442
again my name is Zach Gardner, chief architect at Keyhole Software.

516
00:32:15,506 --> 00:32:19,174
Thank you very much for my presentation and I hope you enjoy the rest of

517
00:32:19,212 --> 00:32:19,620
42.
