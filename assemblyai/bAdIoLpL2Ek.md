# Debugging Large Language Models in Production

Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have enabled new natural language features in applications, but bring challenges around unpredictability and lack of traditional testing. Companies must adapt techniques to build quality LLM-powered features users love. 

Honeycomb recently launched a query assistant feature powered by an LLM to translate natural language queries into their UI after just 6 weeks of development. However, they then spent 8 more weeks iterating based on qualitative user feedback and analytics before achieving goals like improved new user retention.

## The Value of Observability

Observability through logging and metrics is critical to debug issues and understand changes in LLM behavior over time. Honeycomb captures detailed traces for each query assistant request, including:

- Input query text 
- LLM provider response
- Errors or latency

Reviewing outliers and trends in this data helped prioritize improvements to reach a service level objective (SLO) of 95% successful requests from an initial 75%.

## Qualitative Insights

Quantitative analytics only provide part of the picture. Gathering qualitative feedback through surveys and user studies is equally important to understand if an LLM is truly helping users achieve goals.

LLMs can provide reasonable outputs that seem helpful on the surface. But users may still struggle to get value, so their perspective guides iteration.

## Start Simple, Then Iterate

The key lessons are to start with a minimum viable LLM feature, instrument it for observability, and plan on rapid iteration guided by user feedback. This allows tuning the unpredictable model for your unique use case over time.

LLMs are powerful but nascent tools. With the right techniques, companies can leverage them to delight users.
