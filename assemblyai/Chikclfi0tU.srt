1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:00,960
You.

2
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,046
Hello, everyone. So in this talk, we will be talking about

3
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:28,258
protocols which are used to enable IoT systems.

4
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:32,466
And these protocols are wired as well as wireless.

5
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,658
So we will be discussing about various protocols

6
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:40,360
in this particular session. So, like,

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,566
the first question which we want to ask is why protocols

8
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:48,138
are important. See, to make any system work,

9
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:52,026
we need to have a set of instructions which are also known

10
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:55,146
as protocols. So to enable

11
00:00:55,258 --> 00:00:59,546
IoT systems, we require certain set of protocols

12
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:03,226
which needs to be followed. And let's

13
00:01:03,258 --> 00:01:06,880
see. So the Internet of Thing is something which is

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,810
realized by the interconnectedness of the devices.

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,662
So to enable this interconnectedness, we need

16
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:19,334
various protocols. And in things session we will see

17
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:22,774
which all protocols are needed. So basically there

18
00:01:22,812 --> 00:01:26,774
are two types of protocol. One is wired and another one are

19
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:29,926
wireless. So first we will see wired protocols,

20
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,382
and after that we'll see wireless protocol.

21
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:37,514
And let me assure you that wireless protocols are much more interesting than

22
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:40,782
wired ones because wired ones is something

23
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:44,574
very basic which we can see like everywhere around us,

24
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:48,506
but wireless. Many new protocols

25
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:52,174
are coming up every other week for the

26
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:56,114
wireless Internet of things. So that part would be more interesting.

27
00:01:56,312 --> 00:02:00,450
So let's start with wired Iot protocols.

28
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,386
So these, like, as the name says, wired protocols

29
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,986
or wired Internet of things protocols are enabled

30
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:13,910
through physical cables. Like we have

31
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,698
real physical cable which goes from point a to point b

32
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:21,594
to make sure that our system works.

33
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:25,318
So these wired protocols,

34
00:02:25,414 --> 00:02:28,506
there are certain advantages of these things, like they

35
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:32,330
are more reliable and offers stable connection.

36
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,982
And these protocols are generally used to

37
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:41,114
make connection between sensors and the microcontrollers,

38
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:45,058
or microcontrollers and the gateways. And sometimes

39
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:48,866
if we are using like Ethernet Internet, then from gateways to the

40
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:52,638
server as well. So let's see, what are the advantages,

41
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:56,962
what are the disadvantages and various types of wired

42
00:02:57,026 --> 00:03:00,850
Iot protocols. So, like as you can see in this image,

43
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,770
there are many small electronic

44
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,494
components connected with each other. So how these components

45
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:13,098
are talking to each other, that is

46
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:16,794
defined by these wired IoT protocols. So one

47
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:20,494
advantage of wired IoT protocols is they are much

48
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:24,030
more reliable because we know

49
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,934
a clear path from where the signal has to transfer from

50
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:31,994
point a to point b, and that path is through the wires.

51
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:35,934
So there are very less chance that some kind of interference

52
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,198
will occur or some kind of intrusion will occur.

53
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:43,186
And it offers better security because everything is

54
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:46,854
enclosed in a physical space and no

55
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:49,320
one from outside can read those things.

56
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,550
See, definitely it will offer better speed

57
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,182
because we know at our home also, WiFi is

58
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:03,622
always slower than the physical lan cable.

59
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:07,222
So same things applies here, because if we have wires,

60
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:10,926
we know like 100% the signal will go from point a

61
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:15,182
to point b. And the range, like it offers good

62
00:04:15,236 --> 00:04:18,926
range because through wires, we can transfer the

63
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:21,978
signals from kilometers to kilometers.

64
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:25,822
But IoT also depends on the protocol,

65
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:29,874
like how the signals are being transferred. So the range is

66
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:34,094
something which may fluctuate for different protocols.

67
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:38,026
So let's begin and start with the most basic,

68
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:42,034
most basic IoT protocol, or let's say most basic

69
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:45,878
electronics protocol. This protocol is

70
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:49,266
used in almost like all of the electronic appliances,

71
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:52,810
be it your smart tv, be it your speaker, be it your

72
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,074
mobile phone, or be it your vehicle, or like

73
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,386
anything. UArt is the most basic protocol which

74
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:03,678
is being used. It is a serial protocol, like the

75
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:06,718
data goes after one after another.

76
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:11,246
And this is basically used to

77
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:15,250
enable the communication between two devices

78
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,438
over a shorter range of distances.

79
00:05:19,614 --> 00:05:22,850
And it is very simple to implement. There are various

80
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,466
libraries and packages available for all the microcontrollers.

81
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:31,254
And this is the most basic protocols, which if you

82
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:35,094
are getting into IoT, you need to study about this thing and use it as

83
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:38,870
well. And there are some disadvantages,

84
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,838
like it can only be used for shorter distances

85
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:46,282
and interface interference is also

86
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:49,798
there. Second one is like I two c.

87
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:54,240
So advantage of I two c over any other

88
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,210
wired protocol is that we just require two wires

89
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,138
to enable this particular protocol. And we can

90
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:06,958
connect multiple hardware on those two lines.

91
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:10,238
So it works as a multimaster, multislaves.

92
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:13,506
Like, we just need to have two wires. And on

93
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:17,346
these two wires we can connect hundreds or thousands

94
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:21,106
of different devices or sensors

95
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:24,674
or actuators. And like each sensor or actuator

96
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:28,620
will have a particular address. So these two

97
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,434
guidelines, which we have, one is for the address and another is

98
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:37,226
to transfer the data. And this protocol is

99
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:41,034
also used in various sensors, if you startups exploring

100
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:44,462
any industry grade sensors. So most

101
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:47,280
of the sensors work on like I two C bus.

102
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,994
And it is efficient for shorter distances.

103
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:55,870
But for longer distances, there could be some synchronization

104
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,154
issues because see, like on two wires we are using so

105
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:02,242
many hardware. So some issues will be there.

106
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:05,780
But yeah, another thing to note down here is

107
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,582
if we decrease the number of devices

108
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:13,286
on I two C bus, we can increase the range or we

109
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,566
can increase the speed. So that is one thing

110
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:20,440
to note. Another important protocol for

111
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,474
like enabling wired Internet of things systems is

112
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:28,246
SPI. SPI is, let's say more advanced

113
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:31,678
version of the protocols which we saw

114
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:35,322
like earlier. So this also works on a master

115
00:07:35,386 --> 00:07:39,086
slave architecture, but there is always one master in

116
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:42,282
this particular case, which is usually the microcontroller.

117
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:46,046
And these slaves will be all the sensors and actuators.

118
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:49,938
The advantage of using SPI is it works on

119
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:54,354
very high speed communication, and IoT

120
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,794
requires more wires. It requires four wires

121
00:07:57,922 --> 00:08:01,302
to work for each slave. So, like,

122
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:04,982
if there are multiple slaves and

123
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:08,326
one master microcontroller, then the number of wires will

124
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,482
increase for SPI. And SPI is also used,

125
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:15,322
like in many of the gateways. If you see anything with

126
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:19,162
antennas, be it your Wi Fi router or be Iot

127
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:21,990
the cellular signals, antennas,

128
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,582
like these circuits, will be having something

129
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:28,634
or other which is working on these, like, SPI protocol,

130
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,758
because it is very high speed. Now,

131
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,134
these three were the most basic electronics,

132
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,380
or like IoT protocols. Now we will move to something which is specific to

133
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,702
industrial IoT, or let's say specifically

134
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:48,806
for IoT things. So one of the protocol is

135
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:52,710
modbus. This is very much used in industry.

136
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,534
Manufacturing. Like anything in your home which is manufactured

137
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:01,258
in some or other kind of factory must

138
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:05,194
have been gone through this modbus protocols, because these

139
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:08,902
machinery which is controlling that manufacturing plant

140
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:13,162
or the machines which are present in that manufacturing

141
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:17,386
plant is certainly working on things. Modbus protocol.

142
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:22,080
And it is very simple to use, and it is

143
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,994
widely used in manufacturing and other

144
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:29,330
industrial grade IoT systems.

145
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,394
This protocol, I think, like every one

146
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:36,934
of you have used, like, if you are a bit from

147
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:40,934
the older generation, because like earlier, we don't used to

148
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:44,274
have WiFi everywhere. So we used to have that lan

149
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,962
cable which we have to drag and put

150
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:51,114
it in the Ethernet or RJ 45

151
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:53,770
port in our laptop or computers.

152
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,702
So this is also like very old protocol,

153
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:03,082
which is still being used in many IoT

154
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:06,846
systems. This is used in industrial as well

155
00:10:06,868 --> 00:10:10,654
as like home or office networks. Advantages like

156
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:14,198
high speed, it can support up to one gbps

157
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:18,002
of speed. Like, I have one gbps connection in my home,

158
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:21,666
and through WiFi, I am only able to get 400 to

159
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,990
600 mbps. But from Ethernet wire, I get exact

160
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,922
one gbps speed of Internet. And limitation

161
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:35,238
is like, you cannot drag it anywhere in

162
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:40,226
the house. It can only be enabled

163
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:43,466
at a particular place. If you have a cpu in your room, then you can

164
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:47,226
only use in that cpu. If you have laptop, then you have

165
00:10:47,248 --> 00:10:49,850
to physically put this wire in your laptop.

166
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,190
You cannot use it, like anywhere in the house, like Wi Fi.

167
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:58,142
This is very interesting protocols, which is like

168
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:01,914
OPC, UA. This is like a unified

169
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:05,422
architecture which was formed by the consortium

170
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:08,658
of many companies

171
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:12,018
who work on Iot. So this is a standard.

172
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,686
Like, they made a particular standard for like, m to

173
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,042
m communication or machine to machine communication.

174
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:23,362
This protocol is also used in manufacturing and process controls,

175
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:27,378
like in your electricity grids or your water

176
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:30,140
system. Advantages like,

177
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,378
there are many companies who make their own products.

178
00:11:34,464 --> 00:11:38,326
So all these companies thought like, let's make some unified

179
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:42,174
architecture for our IoT products. So in this thing,

180
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:46,270
you can have a gateway from Samsung and a

181
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,902
sensor from Siemens or a sensor from

182
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:53,682
Honeywell, and they all will be working with

183
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:57,806
each other. So this protocol provides interoperability.

184
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:01,620
But at the same time, this thing is a bit

185
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,654
complex to implement. But for

186
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,526
us, we always have sdks to just use these

187
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:13,240
things easily. So this is the thing,

188
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,882
another protocol, which is like almost used

189
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:21,462
in all of the vehicles, be it your two wheeler,

190
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:24,458
four wheeler, trucks, or anything else.

191
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:28,314
So this is a standard protocols for

192
00:12:28,352 --> 00:12:31,774
your vehicles. You can also access a

193
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:36,046
part of this protocol if you have access to the OBD port

194
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:39,550
in your vehicle. So what usually happens is

195
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,262
if you are driving a four wheeler, there will be many things

196
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:47,490
happening, like engine rpm, coolant temperature,

197
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,620
the speed of the vehicle, the amount of the fuel present.

198
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,238
So all these things can be accessed through the can protocols.

199
00:12:56,414 --> 00:13:00,258
We just have to plug in obd reader

200
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:04,440
and all these information can be read. So this particular

201
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,310
protocol is used in vehicles or

202
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,354
like vehicles, be it two vehicle, four wheeler,

203
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:15,946
or like trucks or buses or

204
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:20,418
anything. But IoT is not used in railways or like airplanes

205
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:24,622
for those things. There are very specific protocols which

206
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:27,694
we will not be discussing in this talk.

207
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:31,774
So the

208
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,442
scenario of wired protocol is very

209
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:39,294
small. Like, you only have certain set of protocols

210
00:13:39,342 --> 00:13:43,342
and they work like that. There is not much innovation

211
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,694
happening in things particular field as compared to

212
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:50,662
the wireless IoT protocols. So let's move

213
00:13:50,716 --> 00:13:54,822
on to wireless IoT protocols and see how that scenario is coming

214
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,150
up. So, in wireless protocols,

215
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,658
like we know, there is no physical connection. We can have

216
00:14:01,744 --> 00:14:04,950
two devices present anywhere,

217
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,254
there is no physical connection between them, and they are communicating

218
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,960
with radio waves. So this is used in

219
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,360
variables like your smartwatch is sending the data to the phone

220
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,614
through bluetooth. Or smart cities where your traffic is

221
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,546
controlled by some IoT protocols,

222
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:28,706
like the street lights, it is controlling the street lights, or it

223
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:32,994
is controlling the traffic signals. There are remote sensors which are

224
00:14:33,192 --> 00:14:37,230
reading the temperature, humidity, or like air quality values.

225
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,174
Transportation, where you can track your vehicle. Where is my

226
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:45,042
vehicle present right now? Or if you have booked an Uber,

227
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:48,838
you can track where is your Uber? Like, all this is happening through

228
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:52,634
wireless protocols. So, first of all,

229
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:56,970
we'll see what is the advantage. I think everyone knows. Like, it offers flexibility,

230
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,194
IoT offers mobility. Like you can move your things from

231
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:04,400
one place or one room to another and it will still work.

232
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,206
Scalability. So suppose there is a wifi in your house and you are

233
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:11,422
using four laptops with that. And suppose your friend,

234
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:15,602
up friend comes to your home, he or she also wants to use your

235
00:15:15,656 --> 00:15:19,634
wifi connection. They can easily connect to your

236
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:23,714
network without any trouble. But same thing, if there was

237
00:15:23,752 --> 00:15:27,346
a lan connection and you have to put an ethernet cable, then there

238
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:30,246
will be various issues. Like first of all you have to put a cable in

239
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:34,470
your router. After that your friend will use that cable and

240
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,606
like again, range. Like if we speak about 4g

241
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:41,820
or 5g connections, so they work like all over your city.

242
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,906
So it offers good range as well. Now first

243
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:50,894
of all, we'll go through some protocols which we all

244
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:54,218
have heard about. The first one is bluetooth.

245
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:58,538
So it is something which is for shorter range because bluetooth

246
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:02,334
signals cannot move beyond say 2020,

247
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:06,130
5 meters. After that they will start to decrease.

248
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,638
And in bluetooth we also have various

249
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:14,690
flavors of bluetooth, like we have ble, which is bluetooth

250
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,374
low on energy. So ple is used

251
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:22,406
for systems like your smartwatch because we need

252
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:25,670
to conserve the battery life in the watch.

253
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,302
We can trade off it with the range, but in smartwatch,

254
00:16:29,366 --> 00:16:33,146
either way we don't need higher range, like maybe two or

255
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:36,618
3 meters. That's it. IoT is

256
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,910
present everywhere. Like any electronic

257
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,214
device you buy, be it any smartphone or

258
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,720
laptop, bluetooth will always be presented that. And now

259
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,958
Bluetooth is mostly used with Bluetooth speakers, Bluetooth headsets and

260
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:54,546
all these things. So Bluetooth is

261
00:16:54,568 --> 00:16:57,570
like the most basic wireless protocol.

262
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,326
Second widely adopted wireless protocols is Wi Fi.

263
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,302
It is also used in many IoT systems.

264
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:07,830
See, most of your smart home things will be using

265
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,282
Wi Fi like smart lamp or smart speaker,

266
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,194
or if you take the case of Amazon Alexa.

267
00:17:14,322 --> 00:17:17,686
So like alexa connects with the Wi Fi to stream the

268
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:21,642
songs or give any of the information to you. So it is used in local

269
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:25,770
area networks, smart homes, offices and these public

270
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,434
spaces as well. High transfer data rate.

271
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:33,502
I think with Wifi five or six, like we can

272
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:37,166
get one gbps of speed. But one thing

273
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:41,262
to note is it uses higher

274
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:45,206
amount of electricity, so you won't find Wifi

275
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:49,262
protocol like in the appliances or IoT devices

276
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:53,282
which run on battery. It is like

277
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:57,830
always present in something which runs on the mains power supply.

278
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,054
One important protocol for

279
00:18:02,092 --> 00:18:05,990
IoT is Zigbee. Zigbee is mostly used in home automation

280
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,054
and the advantages it offers a decent

281
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:13,914
amount of range with very less electricity. So if you

282
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:17,500
have any of the IoT devices in your home,

283
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,330
which requires a special gateway,

284
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,046
that IoT device is most probably using a

285
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:27,486
Zigbee protocol. So, Zigbee is also

286
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:31,002
very similar to Wi Fi, where you need to have a router or a gateway,

287
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:34,434
and all the Zigbee clients will connect to

288
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:38,094
that particular gateway. And like, another advantage

289
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:41,394
is it gives us the

290
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:45,662
option to exploit the features of mesh networking.

291
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:50,210
So, mesh networking is something like, if there are four devices

292
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,654
present, four IoT devices present in your home,

293
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:57,366
they will relay their information from bones to two to three, and the

294
00:18:57,388 --> 00:19:00,762
third one will relay it to the gateway and something

295
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:04,442
like that. So all the IoT devices will be able to connect

296
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:07,818
to each other and send, and finally send that information

297
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:11,214
to the gateway. Speaking about

298
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:15,630
the range, so, Zigbee gives a decent range of, say, 100 meters.

299
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,374
So that is decent for any of the smart home

300
00:19:19,412 --> 00:19:23,058
scenarios. Another protocol, like in

301
00:19:23,144 --> 00:19:26,738
wireless protocols, the scenario is there is always

302
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,402
a fight between two protocols. So there is a fight

303
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:35,146
between Zigbee and Zwave. So these two protocols

304
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:38,610
offer almost same advantages,

305
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,898
and they have same disadvantages,

306
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,840
but let's go through them.

307
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,246
According to me, I think in the war between Zigbee

308
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:55,114
and Zwave, Zigbee has already won

309
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,726
that war, and like Zwave is slowly

310
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:02,542
and slowly going out of the market. So, IoT also

311
00:20:02,596 --> 00:20:06,174
offers same flexibility, that is

312
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:09,742
of Zigbee, low powered wireless communication. And it is also used

313
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:13,860
in smart home scenarios, mesh networking and all these things.

314
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,806
Now we will move to some interesting wireless protocols.

315
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:22,238
Like the first one is my favorite, which is Loravan.

316
00:20:22,414 --> 00:20:25,640
So when we see

317
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,006
these particular protocols, they are called as

318
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,234
long range, wide area network,

319
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:36,354
or like wide area network protocols.

320
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:40,746
So these are also wireless protocols, but the

321
00:20:40,768 --> 00:20:44,282
range is like 5 km or 8

322
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:48,454
km, something of that scale.

323
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:53,150
So, in Loravan protocols, you can place a gateway inside

324
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,958
your home. It's not very expensive, like you can

325
00:20:57,044 --> 00:21:00,160
plays it in your home and in your city,

326
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,770
you will have your private network connection for

327
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,382
say like 5 km. So, like, any of the sensor

328
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:12,082
you place in that five kilometer range will have the access

329
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:15,910
to your private network. And these

330
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,826
sensors, the most important advantage of Loravan

331
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:23,702
is that IoT requires very low

332
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:27,314
amount of electricity. So the sensors, which are,

333
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:31,114
let's say, battery operated, can run for like

334
00:21:31,152 --> 00:21:34,886
five, six or eight years without any interference.

335
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:38,678
So this particular protocol

336
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:42,062
offers long range with low

337
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:46,286
power consumption. But at these same time, there is the trade off

338
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,822
with the speed. So you won't be getting

339
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:53,646
any gbps or mbps of speed, like rarely

340
00:21:53,678 --> 00:21:57,390
you will get five or six kbps

341
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,214
of speed, but it is still decent if you have basic

342
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:05,522
sensors for which you want to send the data.

343
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:09,206
It is mostly used in smart cities and like also in

344
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:12,582
smart agriculture. It is

345
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:16,594
very much low powered. Like a battery operated device

346
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:19,980
can also run for five years at least.

347
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,278
And transfer speeds

348
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:27,594
are pretty low. At the same

349
00:22:27,632 --> 00:22:31,946
time, like in this particular space, which is like Lpvan, low powered,

350
00:22:31,978 --> 00:22:35,806
wide area network. There are many other protocols. Another one

351
00:22:35,828 --> 00:22:39,486
is nbiot. So, Loravan is

352
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:43,374
something which operates on ISM

353
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,270
frequency band, which is industrial,

354
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,402
scientific or medicinal. But like

355
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:54,386
NBIoT, for this, you need to purchase the spectrum to

356
00:22:54,408 --> 00:22:57,542
run this protocol. And this protocol is

357
00:22:57,596 --> 00:23:00,930
usually offered by the ISPs

358
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,502
or SIM providers in your

359
00:23:04,556 --> 00:23:07,694
area. So if there is Vodafone,

360
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:11,498
like Vodafone will be providing 4G or 5G services as

361
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:14,694
well as they will be providing NBiot.

362
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:17,690
Similarly for AT and T or any other protocol.

363
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,046
So like one advantage of NBIot is

364
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:25,358
for these service provider or for these

365
00:23:25,524 --> 00:23:29,470
network provider. These don't have to install additional antennas

366
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,522
to give access to this protocols. So if suppose at

367
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:37,006
and T already has thousands

368
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,642
of antenna in a country using those same

369
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:44,274
antennas, using those same four g, five g antennas, we can also give

370
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:47,894
access to this IoT protocol. And it is also being

371
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:51,750
used in smart cities asset tracking. And for

372
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,514
these also the sensors can be run on battery.

373
00:23:56,562 --> 00:24:00,454
And they will be providing battery

374
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:04,374
life of say five, six years. I personally have used Loravan

375
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:08,282
as well as NBIot. And these two protocols are very

376
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:12,478
similar. The only advantage to go for Loravan is

377
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:16,842
like you can have your own private infrastructure, but with IoT,

378
00:24:16,986 --> 00:24:19,738
you have to go with the network providers.

379
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:23,374
Another important protocols in this particular space is like

380
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:27,058
lp van space is Sigfox. So like,

381
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:30,802
speaking of the advantages, same advantages things gives low

382
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:34,820
power, long range connectivity. And it is

383
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:40,370
having same disadvantages,

384
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,040
which are like slow data rate and all these things.

385
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,546
So it is almost similar to IoT

386
00:24:48,578 --> 00:24:52,034
and Loravan. But this protocol

387
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:55,850
is also slowly and slowly getting outdated.

388
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,860
So Sigfox is moving also out.

389
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,720
One important startup about which I want to talk about is

390
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,630
lacuna. It is project Lacuna.

391
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,550
And what these guys are doing is they are placing

392
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,206
Loravan sensor in these satellites

393
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:19,474
around the Earth orbit. And what they are

394
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:23,330
claiming is like if on planet Earth,

395
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,846
from anywhere, if you have access to the sky, you can see

396
00:25:27,868 --> 00:25:30,470
the sky from your line of sight.

397
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,294
You can use Loravan protocol because those

398
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,160
guys already have the satellites in the space.

399
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,954
So if you have any of the application where things are

400
00:25:40,992 --> 00:25:44,282
moving on a ship and you want to send

401
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:48,186
some data to your server, then you can use

402
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:52,894
Loravan protocol to send that information from

403
00:25:52,932 --> 00:25:56,554
that ship to the satellite using Loravan protocols,

404
00:25:56,602 --> 00:25:59,710
and that satellite will relay the information to your servers.

405
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,940
So, like in wireless protocol, many new things are happening.

406
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,334
Now, let's see, what is a comparison

407
00:26:08,382 --> 00:26:11,940
between wired and wireless? We cannot say like

408
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,470
wireless is the winner or wired is the winner.

409
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,800
Like almost in every case,

410
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,562
these two things will work in conjunction

411
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:28,658
of each another. So if you have

412
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:32,662
IoT system, a complex IoT system, it is surely

413
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:36,250
using wired as well as wireless protocols.

414
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,754
The choice is up to you, like which wired or which

415
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:43,182
wireless protocol you have to use. But these two

416
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:46,640
protocols will always be used together.

417
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:51,498
Most of the sensors, actuators or microcontrollers

418
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:55,170
connection will be happening through wired protocols. And from

419
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,626
microcontroller when we are relaying the information to the

420
00:26:58,648 --> 00:27:01,986
gateway or from the gateway to the server. Most of the

421
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:04,622
time we prefer to use wireless protocols.

422
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,960
So advantages of wired protocols is like

423
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,106
they offer very good reliability and stable connection.

424
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,330
And they are more secure because in wireless,

425
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,514
like someone can eavesdrop on your signal and try

426
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:25,322
to decrypt it. But in wired protocols, there is no chance like

427
00:27:25,456 --> 00:27:27,770
anyone will be able to read your signal.

428
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,454
And wireless protocol advantages like you

429
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:34,846
can place your sensor anywhere. You don't have to care about laying the

430
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:37,920
wires or something like that.

431
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,254
And like in wireless, there are many protocol you

432
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:45,522
have to first understand your use case. After that,

433
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:48,878
choose between if your sensor or IoT

434
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:53,022
device will be having access to mains electricity

435
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:56,534
source, or you have to use a

436
00:27:56,732 --> 00:28:00,758
battery to operate your devices. Maybe it could be solar

437
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:04,646
powered. And you also have to think

438
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:08,426
about the speed at which you have to transfer the data. If you

439
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:11,754
have some basic sensors, which just has to

440
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,986
send like a temperature or humidity values, then we

441
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:18,922
can use like LPvan protocols. But if you have some

442
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:22,574
IoT device which is sending like say a

443
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:26,094
video stream, then we require something high speed like

444
00:28:26,132 --> 00:28:29,694
Wifi, or we can also use wired protocol like

445
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:32,994
Ethernet for that. So when

446
00:28:33,032 --> 00:28:37,060
we talk about real world applications, like smart home

447
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,300
is one of the scenarios where IoT devices are

448
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,446
growing at a very fast pace. So in

449
00:28:45,468 --> 00:28:49,206
smart home, if you see any of the device, IoT is using wired and

450
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,534
wireless protocols. Let's say you

451
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:56,246
have a smart led present in

452
00:28:56,268 --> 00:29:00,310
your house. So that led is actually an actuator

453
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:05,126
which is controlled by a microcontroller. So that microcontroller

454
00:29:05,158 --> 00:29:08,774
to led IC signal will be something over wired

455
00:29:08,822 --> 00:29:12,462
protocol, but that MCU will

456
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:15,914
be connected to the server or to the Internet

457
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,890
via Wi Fi or Zigbee or any other protocols.

458
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,742
So both wired and wireless

459
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:26,814
protocol are being used similarly with these case of industrial

460
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:31,150
automation. Like suppose we have a factory where machines

461
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,766
are working together to manufacture your

462
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:38,454
products, something of the use. So those machines will

463
00:29:38,492 --> 00:29:42,070
be controlled by a protocol, let's say modbus.

464
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,386
And in that smart factory, there are various sensors

465
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:50,434
which are present, let's say temperature and humidity

466
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:53,494
sensor, just to track the working conditions of that factory.

467
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:57,094
For those sensors, we can have protocol like Loravan

468
00:29:57,142 --> 00:30:00,266
to send the data to the server and all these things. So in

469
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:03,950
short, like any IoT system will

470
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,246
be using wired as well as wireless protocol. And if

471
00:30:07,268 --> 00:30:10,526
you are making a system, then first of all, you have to

472
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:13,854
understand your use case. And after that you have to see

473
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:18,314
which wired protocol I will be using or which wireless protocol

474
00:30:18,362 --> 00:30:22,014
I have to use. So this is the trade off which you guys

475
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:25,414
have to choose. And I think all

476
00:30:25,452 --> 00:30:29,606
for this talk. Thank you guys for

477
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,954
listening to my talk. And I am very much passionate

478
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:37,474
about IoT. And if you guys are also passionate,

479
00:30:37,522 --> 00:30:41,954
then we can also connect on LinkedIn. Or if you have any question or queries

480
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:46,040
you can anytime ask me, I would be more than happy to answer it.

481
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,580
So thank you guys, have a nice day.
