00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,846
Hi everyone, my name is Matty from Uptime

2
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,734
Labs. Thanks so much for coming to my talk at uptime

3
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:19,722
Labs. I lead generative AI projects in the space

4
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,306
of instant management. Instant management is very important to

5
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:27,086
me because in the past couple of years me and my team have been

6
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:31,130
dealing with machine learning models

7
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,294
and large data to handle. And as

8
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:38,100
you know, a lot of incidents happen in that space.

9
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,034
Incident management incidents management role so I

10
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:45,746
started to start with I asked Chat GPT to

11
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:49,080
give me a definition of incident management in general.

12
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,200
Although the short answer is correct,

13
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,546
the main components that all we know related

14
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,570
to people management is missing in this definition.

15
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,602
As we all know, there is more people managers elements to

16
00:03:06,656 --> 00:03:09,894
instant management elements such as effective coordination,

17
00:03:09,942 --> 00:03:13,586
effective communication, managing people in stress and under pressure,

18
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:17,662
time managers, and understanding incident mechanics. Of course, I provided these

19
00:03:17,716 --> 00:03:21,482
as feedback to Chat GPT, so hopefully

20
00:03:21,626 --> 00:03:25,438
you won't see you will get more complete

21
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:29,470
answers regarding incident management if you ask chat GBT

22
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,490
uptime Labs is a London based startup,

23
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,146
almost two years old at this point. So when you ask

24
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:43,766
Chat GPT to give you some information about uptime labs, of course

25
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:47,382
it lacks that information, but in this case

26
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,662
Weiner was a Google Bard which

27
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:54,470
gives us a brief information about

28
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,842
uptime labs. We are an immersive environment to

29
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:02,502
enable people to practice people skills

30
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:08,142
along with technical skills such as time

31
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:11,806
management. As I said, coordination communication in

32
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:15,920
a safe environment without breaking, worrying about breaking things,

33
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,986
everything is controlled and in a gamified environment you

34
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:23,700
can practice and hone your skills and improve them.

35
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,260
Through this gamified process.

36
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,870
You can also improve instant response skills

37
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,014
and muscle memory, identify the weaknesses with the

38
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:40,834
reports that you get and also test instant

39
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:46,198
response plans, et cetera, et cetera. So you're

40
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:49,498
going to see in a demo in more specific way

41
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:54,426
what we mean by practitioners these skills.

42
00:04:54,618 --> 00:04:58,638
Unlike many other solutions out there, our focus at the moment

43
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:01,230
is people and processes.

44
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,446
A lot of solutions focus on monitoring tools

45
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,302
and monitoring incidents and providing information on incident.

46
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:14,260
But we believe by practicing and

47
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,690
improving people skills,

48
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,882
navigating complex systems becomes

49
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:24,034
more manageable over time. So this immersive

50
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:27,346
environment, we believe will help to hone

51
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:31,000
incident responsive skills over time.

52
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,286
The immersive solution that is provided

53
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,566
by uptime Labs is an immersive

54
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:42,330
environment where you see a full blown

55
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,094
e commerce company. This is their configurable of course,

56
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:50,640
that you have several characters with different personalities and different

57
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,562
characteristics that are powered by generative

58
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:59,186
AI and you can interact with

59
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:03,300
them with your team and you have also

60
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,926
complete stack microservices,

61
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:12,146
kubernetes that realistic

62
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:16,774
dashboards are provided and in the demo you're going to see these

63
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:20,120
dashboards and how these work.

64
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,534
The immersive solution part of it, the main part of it is the virtual characters.

65
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:29,638
Virtual characters that can interact and it can improve

66
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:33,474
your skills. You can provide feedback and they love your feedback.

67
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:35,920
They keep improving over time.

68
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,570
And this team is reconfigurable

69
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,870
based on different drills and different games.

70
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,860
They change skill set and personalities. Of course,

71
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,846
they can be stubborn. They have different personalities.

72
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:59,334
They can have replying within several minutes, which really

73
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:02,886
happens in reality. In case

74
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:07,186
of incidents under pressure, people's response

75
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:10,482
are different critical incidents.

76
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:14,442
Management skills that you can practice. The main

77
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:17,878
important ones, the train points, identify scope

78
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:20,998
of the problem, effective congregation under time pressure,

79
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:24,906
the structured troubleshooting, understanding incident mechanics,

80
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:28,734
forming effective hypothesis, step by

81
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:32,814
step reasoning and effective coordination. All of these are

82
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:36,058
very key to incident management. And we believe with the

83
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:39,774
help of this immersive

84
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:43,714
gamified environment can actually practice these one by

85
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:44,980
one and move forward.

86
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,302
I've prepared a demo for this talk where

87
00:07:51,356 --> 00:07:55,400
you can see how

88
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,818
this gamified environment works. And also

89
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:04,938
I have a surprise for you toward the end.

90
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:08,860
So yeah, bear with me.

91
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,766
The first part of the demo

92
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:18,574
is about the roles in your account. You can play

93
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:21,070
different incidents, management sre role.

94
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,706
You have this virtual online boutique

95
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,230
environment that is completely realistic.

96
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,826
You can go and place order and there

97
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:38,126
are different variety of products are being sold

98
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,582
on this platform. You have your team full

99
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:47,894
hierarchy from CEO to development and platform

100
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:52,202
team escalation team. And this

101
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:55,498
is the hierarchy of the microservices. A lot

102
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:59,366
of different drills are designed and available for you to practice. Different skill

103
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:03,398
set. This drill set

104
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,834
are personalized based on requirements

105
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:13,230
from our customers and they can be personalized

106
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,190
for different skills that you target to practice

107
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,746
over time. The next demo next part

108
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:26,162
of the demo is the actual start

109
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:29,874
of the drill. One of the drills I've selected

110
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:34,278
for this talk is

111
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,710
powered fully by generative AI.

112
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,754
And here you can see the full dashboards.

113
00:09:40,802 --> 00:09:44,454
You can see the orders per minute or all the logs

114
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:48,122
and crfs and the changes that are happening in

115
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:52,220
reality. And in the

116
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,800
main monitoring dashboard you can see the logs happening across different

117
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,414
teams and services and the

118
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:05,694
main communication platform chosen to be

119
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:09,554
slack at the moment. And in slack you

120
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:13,390
are able to interact

121
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,860
with your team. At the moment.

122
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:21,494
The plan for supporting audio and video will

123
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:24,774
happen in the future, but we're working on it.

124
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:31,542
But at the moment it's text based and the communication happens

125
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:35,358
on Slack. When you started rail,

126
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:40,262
you are given two main channels automatically

127
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:45,226
generated for you. Instant bridge,

128
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:48,960
basically. And a business communication channel.

129
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,746
When you start drill your characters,

130
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:57,966
your team come and introduce themselves. Like introduce

131
00:10:57,998 --> 00:11:01,682
the company. Bez is the CEO, the person

132
00:11:01,736 --> 00:11:05,540
that sets the tone for the company and

133
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,246
gives an introduction to the train.

134
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:13,970
And as they're explaining

135
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,262
and like a bit of chats going on, to give you some

136
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,110
idea about different characters. In the meantime,

137
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,426
you're understanding the mindset of the people in

138
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:30,220
your team. And there's a point

139
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,378
that incident

140
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:35,680
gets started.

141
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,710
And at that point, Bob, which is customer

142
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,938
services manager, comes and reports

143
00:11:45,114 --> 00:11:49,090
that the customers are not able to see place

144
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,426
orders and

145
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:57,566
incidents. Manager role is to check the dashboards.

146
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:01,080
And you see in reality that things are going down,

147
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,682
things are breaking and user activities

148
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:09,190
going down and starting to get the pressure,

149
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,966
feel the pressure from the team. A lot of different messages

150
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,406
coming from different characters.

151
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:20,342
And of course they have different responsibilities

152
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:24,106
at this point, declaring that who's

153
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:28,000
the incident manager is very important.

154
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,070
So that the team knows who's taking command.

155
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,660
And in this example,

156
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,850
Daniel is my assistant and

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,526
from development team. And I'm interacting

158
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:48,210
with Daniel to form better hypothesis

159
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,600
and be able to.

160
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,766
Because of Dan having access to logs and

161
00:12:55,788 --> 00:13:00,630
the patterns from the previous incidents. I like to question

162
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,314
Dan in terms of the

163
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:08,614
changes and a bit of information about that. So Daniel

164
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,780
in this case, is a generative AI agent.

165
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,150
And in the meantime,

166
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,990
as you move forward and as you practice,

167
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:24,480
you're getting rewards and hints as well.

168
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,906
And they are directly going to

169
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:34,420
your report of how you play the drill, your performance report.

170
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,966
At this point, I'm asking Daniel about the

171
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:42,614
latest changes. And I would like to know

172
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:45,874
if the incidents, the current incident,

173
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:50,582
there's any similarities and the patterns and

174
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:54,950
what a response I'm getting from Dan is that the previous

175
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,678
incidents that we had in the last week, like database

176
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:03,146
capacity and ISP issues, or the

177
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:04,910
front end issues of cache.

178
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:11,486
And Daniel comes and says there's similarity in

179
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,686
terms of based on the

180
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,660
logs, it's able to match that with the information there.

181
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,426
And it shares the exact logs to

182
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:28,130
see what the logs are. And I see that the request

183
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,910
per minute are increasing unexpectedly.

184
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,214
And based on the analysis, I gather in the size up

185
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:44,486
stage, which is one of the main steps of instant mechanics,

186
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:48,300
like the size up. And then I'm moving triage, action and review.

187
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,730
At this point in the size up stage,

188
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,162
after gathering enough information, I come to the solution

189
00:14:57,226 --> 00:15:00,800
that, okay, it's time to revert certain change.

190
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,742
And that change is the front end change that

191
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:09,140
I believe is going to help.

192
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:16,014
I command and command

193
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:19,666
Dan and Dan takes care of all dads automatically

194
00:15:19,698 --> 00:15:22,920
for me. And at this point

195
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,194
by checking the dashboards, I keep an eye on the dashboard as an incidents

196
00:15:28,242 --> 00:15:34,154
manager and I see that at some point the

197
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:37,562
placing orders are back up

198
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:41,290
and running. So at this point

199
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,030
which is needed to refresh Grafana

200
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,440
and that change,

201
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,394
I can see that the orders

202
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:58,100
are being placed again and things are back online.

203
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,220
So I reported back to the team and I

204
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,806
provide that information to the team that the

205
00:16:08,828 --> 00:16:13,174
customers are able to put more

206
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,902
orders online and the

207
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:20,834
entire cycle of moving from size up to triage

208
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:24,810
to action to review is try to show

209
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,154
in this demo within five minutes how

210
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:33,618
generative AI is helping me to better understand the logs

211
00:16:33,654 --> 00:16:37,598
and find the patterns and understand the changes

212
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:40,942
and reverting changes and stuff like that within

213
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:45,870
a drill. Hope you enjoyed this

214
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,826
demo. Generally gentle AI at this point

215
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:53,134
helping us with drill design, personalized drill

216
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:56,878
design as I said, other fact of automation

217
00:16:57,054 --> 00:17:00,420
and being able to control the platform.

218
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,110
At this point we're getting help from generative AI

219
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,714
reporting pros and cons and the performance

220
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:14,410
reports based on which could improve and also insights

221
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,874
that are available in the data that can

222
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,740
use AI for getting that information.

223
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,186
Finally, please feel free to scan this

224
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:29,946
code and the first five to sign up

225
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:34,026
