Jamaica. Make up real

2
00:00:06,212 --> 00:00:09,578
time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems

3
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:12,538
and observing changes, exceptions.

4
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:16,746
Errors in real time allows you to not only experiment with confidence,

5
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:20,480
but respond instantly to get things working again.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,360
Close.

7
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,766
Hello, everybody. Welcome to my talk. Also, welcome to comfortitude

8
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:11,918
Chaos Engineering. My name is Kennedy Torkura.

9
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:16,038
I am the cofounder CTO and c two admitigant, the continuous security

10
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:17,400
verification platform.

11
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,962
So this leveraging, I'm going to be talking defeating ransomware attacks,

12
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:26,546
attacks with security chaos engineering. My Twitter

13
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:29,946
handle is up there, and feel free to reach out to

14
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:33,514
me to ask questions regarding my talk.

15
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:37,142
I'm very passionate about this topic, and I'm always wishing,

16
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:40,782
I'm always available to talk about it. All right,

17
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:44,090
so firstly, let us look at ransomware.

18
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,534
Right, an overview of ransomware attacks. So,

19
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:51,130
ransomware, what is it? It is basically a type of malicious

20
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,170
software, which is actually called malware,

21
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,954
that threatens these publish or blocks access to

22
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,970
data or computer systems, usually by encrypting it

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,394
until the victim pays a ransom fee

24
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:09,478
to the attacker. So what ransomware does is

25
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:13,158
it's similar to what kidnappers do in the

26
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:16,646
physical world. They kidnap people and

27
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:20,058
then they ask for some kind of ransom which has to

28
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:22,502
be paid before they release victims.

29
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:26,106
Similarly, this is the same method that the

30
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:30,086
ransomware attackers employ, with the difference that these time

31
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:33,562
around, these attacks, actually happen in the digital

32
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:37,390
space. Now, let us look at some statistics about

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,960
ransomware attacks that have happened in recent years.

34
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,362
And what we have here in this graph. These pie

35
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:49,410
chart is actually gotten from the Zofos report,

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,994
one of their security reports for last year. And we can

37
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:56,822
see these, that actually there is 79%

38
00:02:56,956 --> 00:03:00,246
of ransomware. And this

39
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:03,970
pie chart actually explains the amount of incident

40
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,018
response that they carried out, because this

41
00:03:08,044 --> 00:03:11,706
is a managed security provider. So they kind of offer services

42
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:15,638
for other companies because of their expertise. And according

43
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:19,066
to the report from last year, most of

44
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:24,358
the incidents, response activities that they carried out were

45
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:27,742
in response of ransomware attacks, 79%.

46
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:31,694
That is really high. Also, there are a lot of

47
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:35,346
statistics online if you check about ransomware in the

48
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:39,490
last one year, 18 months. So what

49
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,786
we see from sonic wall is that there is

50
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:46,658
148% increase of ransomware

51
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,786
between Q two of 2020 and Q two of 2021.

52
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:53,554
A lot of ransomware

53
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:57,106
attacks. Also, we see ransomware attacks,

54
00:03:57,298 --> 00:04:01,110
about 190.4 million ransomware attacks,

55
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,874
just as at q three of last year.

56
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,506
The same from sonic wall. There is also an interesting

57
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:12,766
report, actually, this is from the FBI. The FBI in

58
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:16,842
the United States specifically, these have received complaints

59
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:19,200
just in the first half of last year,

60
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,646
2084 complaints about ransomware

61
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:27,058
and of course, talking about finances. This time around,

62
00:04:27,224 --> 00:04:29,570
according to cybersecurity Ventures,

63
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,640
victims will pay a total amount of about $265,000,000

64
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,750
because of ransomware by 2031.

65
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,714
So these are just some statistics

66
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:47,686
about ransomware, how prevalent it is, how it is expanding, how it

67
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,002
is becoming a very huge problem for

68
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:54,794
enterprises and even people. And it just goes to say

69
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:58,826
how important it is for us to begin to take

70
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,942
care of or to begin to prevent ourselves from becoming victims of

71
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:06,974
ransomware. All right, now, we already looked

72
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:11,646
at some of the impacts of ransomware, but here I

73
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:15,790
just want to highlight on five main impacts of ransomware attacks.

74
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,026
Of course, the first is financial loss. As we have seen,

75
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,570
there's a lot of loss of financial.

76
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,846
Companies have to pay a lot of money to the

77
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,870
criminals that are behind these ransomware attacks.

78
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,030
There's also data laws because oftentimes,

79
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,670
even after paying ransom,

80
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,646
the agents, the malicious people behind ransomware attacks, they do

81
00:05:40,668 --> 00:05:44,002
not return all the data. Sometimes these don't even return.

82
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:47,594
They don't even hand over the encryption keys or even if these do

83
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:51,242
that, these are reports that the victims are

84
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:54,746
never able to recover. All the data that got missing,

85
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,382
got lost as a result of the attack. And of course, these is also

86
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,994
reputation damage. Okay, so the reputation

87
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,426
of a company is badly smeared. If they

88
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,026
fall victim to these attacks, they have

89
00:06:09,048 --> 00:06:12,770
to do a lot of communication tactics,

90
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,662
firstly to their customers, to their investors, to the public.

91
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:21,202
They have to apologize. And it's a bad reputation

92
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:24,726
for a company. And they have to spend a lot of money, a lot

93
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:28,502
of resources to be able to repair this reputation

94
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:32,246
if they are ever able to do that. Legal implications

95
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,478
also, this is really huge nowadays,

96
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:39,930
especially for companies that are in Europe, we got the GDPR

97
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,934
and usually what around somewhere, as we'll see later on,

98
00:06:44,052 --> 00:06:47,274
is a culmination of many attacks.

99
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:51,386
Right? The attackers go through multiple steps. And it's

100
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,346
often the case that some of

101
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:58,580
these attacks actually expose data, as we have seen.

102
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,182
And it's often the case where it either directly

103
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:06,470
violates regulations like GDPR,

104
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,406
or it's also the problem where customers of a

105
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:13,814
company that is a victim of ransomware actually take

106
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:17,410
the company to the court. They take the company

107
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,714
because sometimes ransomware impacts their

108
00:07:20,752 --> 00:07:24,298
own activities. It makes the customers lose money, it makes

109
00:07:24,384 --> 00:07:30,266
them lose resources, and they take the company that

110
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:33,998
provided a service to them to court and becomes a legal case.

111
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,706
And of course, it disrupts business. Right? In Germany

112
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:41,258
here, a few months ago, a company called Mediamact,

113
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:44,770
which is one of the biggest online retail shops,

114
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,942
they were attacked by ransomware. Now, this ransomware

115
00:07:49,006 --> 00:07:52,626
actually made it impossible for

116
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:56,246
PoS systems to be used in

117
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,830
the shops so the people could buy,

118
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,734
they could not actually pay for services for products these

119
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:07,906
bought. And this disrupted a lot of business activities. So ransomware,

120
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:11,638
one of the biggest impacts it has, which we feel immediately,

121
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:15,526
is the fact that was a company, your business is disrupted,

122
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:18,966
you cannot serve your customers, you cannot go about your normal

123
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,600
activities. It's a big pain.

124
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,626
All right, now let us look at the steps,

125
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:29,342
right? And as I said before, ransomware is

126
00:08:29,396 --> 00:08:32,586
a combination of multiple steps. In fact,

127
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:36,034
before a ransomware becomes successful, it means

128
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:40,126
the attackers have carried out multiple

129
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,678
attacks against the infrastructure, against the victim.

130
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,060
And in the end,

131
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,042
they are able to kind of identify that material,

132
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:54,582
they're able to identify that resource that is very critical to you,

133
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:58,122
so critical that they can place a huge amount of money

134
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:02,506
and you're going to pay. So what

135
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:06,086
I'm showing here on the screen is about a specific ransomware

136
00:09:06,198 --> 00:09:09,740
called winter two. And this,

137
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,922
Rama, is actually a ransomware that targets windows operating systems.

138
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:19,562
And usually the infection vector is through RDP.

139
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:23,086
And they actually also use phishing

140
00:09:23,118 --> 00:09:27,474
attacks to

141
00:09:27,512 --> 00:09:31,394
target their victims, which might be employees of a company, they might

142
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:34,974
be normal individuals. And they're also distributed using

143
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,838
ransomware as a service, which is another

144
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:42,578
factor that has made ransomware to become very rampant

145
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:46,470
these days. Because what ransomware as a service does is

146
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,470
it lowers the entry barrier for people who want to conduct,

147
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,300
who want to use these attacks because they don't need to have, again,

148
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,054
the technical capabilities to develop ransomware.

149
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:01,294
These don't have to write it from the scratch. They just go to the

150
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:05,262
service provide of ransomware, which are usually available

151
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,358
in the dark web. And they go there and buy the tools and

152
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:13,166
they even offer them services and they buy it at a cheap

153
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:17,906
rate and they are able to use it. So the

154
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:22,130
important thing about this slide here is just to show the attack

155
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,100
can of Wadrama. So Wadrama, as I said before,

156
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,014
starts with an RDP brute force attack, and then

157
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:35,350
the next thing is it scans for connectivity and

158
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,274
also for new targets. The interesting thing in step three there

159
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:43,082
is you see that the ransomware itself, tons of

160
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:46,342
security controls, so it has the capability

161
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:50,006
to identify that you're using maybe some firewalls or some

162
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:53,162
antivirus devices or any software

163
00:10:53,226 --> 00:10:56,894
that might detect its presence, and it switches it off.

164
00:10:57,012 --> 00:11:00,560
It does another network reconnaissance to kind of understand

165
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,438
your network, to understand your keys to the kingdom,

166
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:07,806
to understand what kinds of resources are more critical

167
00:11:07,998 --> 00:11:11,186
to you. As a victim, based on that,

168
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,354
it might move, literally, it might move from one resource to the other,

169
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:17,734
from one network to the other. And other things, as you see

170
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,962
in step five that might occur is credential

171
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:24,722
theft. So they begin to see your credentials.

172
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:28,274
They want to gain root access to certain resources

173
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:32,330
in your network. They place a backdoor so that they can

174
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,138
actually, if at all, you detect them at this point in time

175
00:11:36,224 --> 00:11:40,322
and you flush them out of the system, they leave backdoors

176
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:43,600
which will enable them to come back to your system

177
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,778
along the way, you see, they also have con miner

178
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:52,762
to mine bitcoins in the victim

179
00:11:52,826 --> 00:11:56,514
system. And the last step, which is step eight,

180
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,158
is where they actually ask for ransomware.

181
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:03,746
So you can see that there's a lot of work that they have to do.

182
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:07,926
There's a lot of security loopholes that they have to exploit along the

183
00:12:07,948 --> 00:12:11,478
way. Eventually, they arrive at a

184
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:15,414
place where they feel confident enough that they have verified a

185
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:18,922
resource that is so important that

186
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:22,634
they can place a high price tag on it and they can

187
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:25,820
force their victims to pay

188
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,622
for this resource to be returned

189
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:34,366
or to pay for the decryption key of

190
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,830
the resource. Okay,

191
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,974
so we have looked at ransomware, and now how

192
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:45,200
about these cloud. Okay, so do we have ransomware that happen in the cloud?

193
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,474
There is a lot of misconceptions about ransomware in the cloud,

194
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:53,102
and we're going to be looking at some of those ones. Firstly,

195
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:56,998
what we have seen in recent years is that ransomware has

196
00:12:57,084 --> 00:13:01,506
actually, the attackers, the perpetrators of ransomware attacks,

197
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,602
are now beginning to target cloud based systems,

198
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:09,034
cloud infrastructures, cloud native systems. And why

199
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:12,666
is that? Well, one of the major drivers of this change of

200
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:15,798
tactics is the Covid-19 pandemic.

201
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:19,786
All right, so Covid-19 has come and we are

202
00:13:19,808 --> 00:13:22,734
still in the pandemic. Hopefully, we are out of it very soon.

203
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:26,746
However, many companies have realized

204
00:13:26,858 --> 00:13:30,986
that they have to transform these infrastructure.

205
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:35,042
They are undergoing the digital transformation and they are moving

206
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:39,074
to the cloud because these cloud offers for them most

207
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,466
of those facilities that will help their systems to be

208
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,150
agile, to be elastic, to be robust.

209
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:50,598
One of the major problems about moving to the cloud,

210
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:54,502
amongst many other challenges that people face when they move to the cloud,

211
00:13:54,636 --> 00:13:58,218
is the fact that especially for companies,

212
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:02,650
for enterprises that have both on premises and cloud systems,

213
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,526
the line between on premises and cloud systems

214
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,934
actually is blurred. Right. It is blurred because some

215
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:15,678
cloud service providers make it so easy for

216
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:19,774
the on premises and the in cloud infrastructure to

217
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:26,346
connect. And so this connection becomes

218
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:29,806
a good bridge for attackers to also leverage. And they

219
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:33,086
can actually leverage such connections to

220
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:36,806
easily attack or to move, move laterally from on

221
00:14:36,828 --> 00:14:39,590
premises systems to cloud based systems.

222
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,310
The next thing is misconception. So one of them that I have heard about

223
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,314
is the cloud is immune to ransomware,

224
00:14:47,442 --> 00:14:51,370
right? The cloud is not immune to ransomware.

225
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,514
Cloud is not immune. These cloud offers in the cloud,

226
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:59,626
these is the shared responsibility model, which is one

227
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,550
of the models that is not well understood by most customers

228
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,270
or most people who migrate to the cloud.

229
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,982
Right. As a user of the cloud, you got your

230
00:15:10,036 --> 00:15:13,602
own responsibility. You have a lot of things to take care

231
00:15:13,656 --> 00:15:17,106
of, especially everything that is referred to as

232
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:20,658
a logical security measure. You got to take care of it.

233
00:15:20,744 --> 00:15:24,050
So because of that infrastructure

234
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,150
like object story, like x ray buckets on AWS,

235
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,846
a lot of the security measures that have

236
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:35,320
to be put in place are a responsibility of customers.

237
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,434
And we will see an attack in the next few slides that

238
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:42,794
actually shows how s these buckets are

239
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:46,198
being targeted and being used, have been targeted

240
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,306
during ransomware attacks. All right,

241
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,654
so one of the key things I wanted to take from this

242
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:56,206
slide is that the implications of ransomware in the cloud

243
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:59,562
could be worse than the implications

244
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,830
in traditional or on premises environments.

245
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,470
And the major thing is because firstly,

246
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,766
most cloud resources are misconfigured.

247
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,482
According to Gartner, 99% of cloud

248
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:18,854
resources are going to fall to attacks because

249
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:22,962
of misconfigurations. So there is a high chance that attackers

250
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:24,440
are going to get access,

251
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:29,402
they're going to get privileged access, are they going to leverage it,

252
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:33,206
and they're going to get access to resources

253
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:36,700
that they can use for ransomware. All right,

254
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,470
so what are the countermeasures that are in place now?

255
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,800
There are a lot of countermeasures that have been put out there

256
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,070
for ransomware. A lot of them are written

257
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,202
provided by the cloud service providers themselves. There are

258
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:57,102
also countermeasures that are provided by different security vendors

259
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,330
or security organizations.

260
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,522
One of the important things, as we have seen, that ransomware is a combination

261
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:08,806
of multiple attacks, is that you have

262
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,598
to enable a defense in depth security

263
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:16,674
architecture. Your security architecture has got to be layered.

264
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,380
It is a layered security system that can actually

265
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,470
detect or proven ransomware.

266
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,846
So what we see on this slide,

267
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:31,278
these is basically a very nice way of

268
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:35,280
describing defense in depth. We see that

269
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,178
one of the first layers of ransomware countermeasures

270
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:45,230
is training and awareness. Right. You have to train your employees.

271
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,930
They have to understand the basics of cyber hygiene.

272
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,782
They have to understand that they are targets to things like

273
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,606
phishing emails, and they

274
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:04,114
have to avoid the temptation of clicking links

275
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:07,994
that seem malicious. So basically,

276
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:11,130
there are four main types

277
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,390
of controls. When we talk about defense in depth,

278
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,754
there are the preventive controls, which include things like

279
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:21,454
firewalls, authentication and authorization, identity and

280
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:25,322
access management systems. These are also the detective

281
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:29,038
controls, which actually detect malicious activities in

282
00:18:29,044 --> 00:18:32,538
your environment that might be indicators of compromise

283
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:35,730
regarding sims and login systems.

284
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,998
Then we also have recovery controls. Right? Recovery controls

285
00:18:40,174 --> 00:18:43,934
are those controls that will help a compromised

286
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:47,030
system to come back to life to resume

287
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,994
its normal activities. And what are these controls?

288
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:54,690
These include things like backups, disaster recovery

289
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,502
methods, incident response,

290
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,890
and of course, I've already talked about security awareness.

291
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,382
In summary, most of the ransomware countermeasures

292
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:11,790
fall under these four controls.

293
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,960
Now, you might be wondering, okay,

294
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,794
what has this to do with security chaos engineering?

295
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:24,486
Right? And I'm here today to tell you that security chaos

296
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,062
engineering is one of the robust

297
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:32,306
or one of the best ways you

298
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:35,410
can actually prevent yourself from becoming

299
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,534
a victim of ransomware attacks. Now, security case

300
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:43,890
engineering is the identification of security control failures

301
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,558
through proactive experimentation to build confidence in

302
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:51,782
the system's ability to defend against malicious conditions.

303
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:55,020
Right. And we're going to be looking a little bit into it.

304
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,906
We are in chaos engineering conference. So I

305
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:02,462
want to believe that most of the audience already are sort of used

306
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:05,626
or have heard of chaos engineering.

307
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:09,600
Chaos engineering. Security chaos engineering, actually,

308
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,986
it implements most of the techniques or

309
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,046
the methods or the approaches of chaos engineering.

310
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:22,018
However, this time around, the focus is on security. The focus

311
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:25,842
is on security attributes, on confidentiality,

312
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,990
integrity, and availability.

313
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,534
All right, so let's look at how

314
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:37,846
security cares engineering is what it actually means.

315
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,310
So basically, in security career,

316
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,762
the first thing that you do in security case

317
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:50,398
engineering is to define your hypothesis. In these case,

318
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:54,830
you're talking about security faults. It's about injecting security faults

319
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,194
into your infrastructure so that you can verify

320
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:03,490
if the security controls are functioning was you expect

321
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,502
them to function. All right? And this infrastructure

322
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,678
could be code, source code, could be things like docker containers,

323
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,010
could be cloud infrastructure, could be kubernetes clusters.

324
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,094
In the end, you're actually conducting those

325
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:22,514
security faults so that you will perceive

326
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:26,354
or you will verify if your preventive

327
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:30,106
controls, like the ones we just talked about in the last slide, if they are

328
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:33,994
working as they should work. And because this

329
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:37,226
is security, at the end of the day, there are three main things in your

330
00:21:37,248 --> 00:21:40,526
infrastructure or in your security architecture that you

331
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,000
want to prevent, right?

332
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,058
You want to make sure that the security attributes, which are confidentiality,

333
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:51,530
integrity, and availability are not violated.

334
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,426
Any violation of these is a security breach. It's a security

335
00:21:55,528 --> 00:21:59,742
problem. It might lead to cyberattacks,

336
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:04,674
it might lead to a lot of problems. So at

337
00:22:04,712 --> 00:22:08,354
the core of security chaos engineering is for the protection

338
00:22:08,402 --> 00:22:11,970
of the attributes of security, which are confidentiality,

339
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,470
integrity and availability.

340
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,146
Now let us look at an example scenarios of

341
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:24,570
a ransomware. In this case, it is a bucket ransomware attack.

342
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,390
Now, during a bucket ransomware attack, the attacks

343
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,674
basically, and there are various ways this

344
00:22:31,712 --> 00:22:35,278
could be conducted. The scenario we're going to be using today is just a

345
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:39,038
hypothetical one which might happen. So in these case,

346
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:42,886
firstly, the attacker creates a user called Bob.

347
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:46,334
And after creating these user, that user,

348
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:50,430
Bob tries to get access to an EKS

349
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,638
cluster, a kubernetes cluster on Amazon Web services. By the way,

350
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:58,486
these scenario is typically based on Amazon Web services

351
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:02,630
and actually could be applied to even every other cloud service

352
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,360
provider since they have similar.

353
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,518
So. Well, Bob tries to get access to the EKS clusters.

354
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:14,310
He's able to get access to it. He compromises

355
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,250
one of the clusters, a pod in the cluster.

356
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,266
From there, he gets to understand that this pod

357
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:25,898
is actually looking towards an s three bucket.

358
00:23:25,994 --> 00:23:29,754
And this pod is actually either dumping

359
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:33,474
information or retrieving information from an s three bucket. And it's able

360
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:36,946
to understand that that s, these bucket actually has information that

361
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:41,060
is very critical, maybe things like credit card information or

362
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,938
Social Security numbers or

363
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,880
it could be anything that is very delicate for the company.

364
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,830
And so the next thing it does is to move forward,

365
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,662
take over the bucket, encrypt it, request for ransomware.

366
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:01,738
And that is more or less the lifecycle of

367
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:05,420
a ransomware attacks. Okay.

368
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,622
What's interesting for us here is, well, in this scenario

369
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:13,162
could be actually a security chaos engineering experiment

370
00:24:13,226 --> 00:24:16,778
that you're conducting for your AWS infrastructure.

371
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:20,846
And what you're going to be looking for, firstly, is in

372
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:22,560
the first step of this attack,

373
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,314
let's call it in this attack actually, where a

374
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:30,354
user is created, you want to understand,

375
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:34,306
okay, the detective controls that have been put in place. And this could

376
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:37,606
be like cloud security posture management systems. It could be like the

377
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:41,554
AWS config. These are security controls

378
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:45,174
that should identify when

379
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:48,874
unauthorized access is carried out

380
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:53,082
or these should actually identify unauthorized access. They should

381
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:57,082
identify when people who are not supposed

382
00:24:57,136 --> 00:25:00,430
to create new resources are creating new resources like

383
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,206
a user. And this is something that you will expect

384
00:25:04,388 --> 00:25:08,878
these kinds of tools to detect in

385
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:12,666
the next step. As we discussed, the attacks

386
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:16,766
went forward and got access to an eks cluster

387
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:19,854
and then went forward to compromise one of the pods.

388
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:23,620
Right. And from a security standpoint, you're going to be interested

389
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,398
to understand whether these activities that

390
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:31,234
were done by the attacker before he successfully

391
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:35,314
compromised a pod, if any of the Kubernetes

392
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:38,602
security controls detected this

393
00:25:38,656 --> 00:25:41,130
exploitation, if it was detected,

394
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,622
whether threat detection tools like AWS guard duty

395
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:49,302
or security hub that are actually supposed to detect

396
00:25:49,366 --> 00:25:52,494
the range of activities that will be

397
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:53,390
conducted,

398
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,752
understand, by an attacker to be able to

399
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:02,570
really conduct this attack.

400
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,744
Okay. And now we get to the point where the attacks

401
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:12,456
actually compromises the s, these bucket.

402
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:15,512
And even in this case, these are a lot of activities.

403
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:18,972
Like I said, for the attacker to identify

404
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:22,290
that this bucket has sensitive information,

405
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,336
there is going to be a lot of reconnaissance, there's going to be a lot

406
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:28,960
of probing attacks,

407
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,848
and these are attacks that should be detected.

408
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:36,884
These are specific commands against an s three bucket that

409
00:26:37,082 --> 00:26:40,612
should be deemed as malicious. And you will

410
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:44,500
expect also, again, that things like the access analyzer

411
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,376
of AWS that kind of identifies when access to

412
00:26:48,478 --> 00:26:52,216
resources are suspicious, you expect it

413
00:26:52,238 --> 00:26:55,708
to kind of fire up an alert or from the security

414
00:26:55,794 --> 00:27:00,220
hub and such tools.

415
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,196
Yes. And we finally get to the point where the

416
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:09,280
attack is successful. And as a victim, you're already asking yourself

417
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,816
whether to pay or not to pay because you

418
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:17,788
already saw the request from the attacker for a ransom,

419
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:21,700
right? And this is the point where incident response is actually

420
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,080
triggered. Incident response in most cases is triggered

421
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,860
at the end, after the attack is almost

422
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,604
successful or is already successful after these ransom has been

423
00:27:33,642 --> 00:27:37,096
requested for. Of course. And these

424
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:41,192
is the point, again where things like backups are, people begin

425
00:27:41,246 --> 00:27:44,716
to try to trigger their backups to bring

426
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:47,980
their system back to life, to resume their business activities.

427
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,460
And you want to ask whether are your backups even accessible?

428
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,388
Are they usable? Are these already corrupted?

429
00:27:57,564 --> 00:28:00,896
Are they run books that you use for incident response? Are they

430
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:04,892
even accurate? Are they functional? Are they updated?

431
00:28:05,036 --> 00:28:09,236
Now these are questions that are very interested, very interesting

432
00:28:09,418 --> 00:28:12,580
from a security chaos engineering experiments.

433
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,476
So how do we even run these experiment? So there is

434
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:23,352
a concept of game days, which are specific periods that are set

435
00:28:23,406 --> 00:28:26,920
aside to conduct security chaos engineering experiments, right?

436
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,516
So game days are usually used by DevOps,

437
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:34,012
by sres, to conduct experiments that

438
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:37,704
kind of test how robust or their systems

439
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:41,320
are, how available they are, how they can respond to incident

440
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,132
response. But security game days this time around

441
00:28:45,186 --> 00:28:47,250
are with a security focus.

442
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,596
I will not go into details of the components

443
00:28:51,628 --> 00:28:54,704
of people who should attend this sort of

444
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:58,944
security game days, but essentially you're going to be having your security team

445
00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:02,724
there. You're going to be having maybe some sres, anybody who

446
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:06,400
is actually part of the security incident

447
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,936
response mechanism or lifecycle.

448
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:13,688
You want that person to be part of the game days, part of the security

449
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:14,650
game days.

450
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,184
All right. Now you might

451
00:29:22,222 --> 00:29:25,496
also be thinking about what kinds

452
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:29,084
of security activities should constitute or are

453
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:32,300
good candidates for security chaos engineering.

454
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,464
And there is a very good resource that was released by

455
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:40,348
Amazon Web Services called these ransomware risk management

456
00:29:40,524 --> 00:29:44,320
on AWS using the NIST cybersecurity framework.

457
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,904
And in this document, there are a lot of possibilities.

458
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:52,960
These are a lot of recommended practices that should constitute

459
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,980
either prevention, detection, or recovery from ransomware.

460
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,264
Agreed again, that these are very specific to Amazon

461
00:30:01,312 --> 00:30:04,536
Web services, but again, they are similar

462
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:08,072
resources that you will find in other cloud

463
00:30:08,126 --> 00:30:11,992
service providers. So what are these things? There are things

464
00:30:12,046 --> 00:30:15,724
like, we have already mentioned some of them. Things like checking if

465
00:30:15,762 --> 00:30:19,068
backups are already in place,

466
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:22,584
whether they are well configured, corruption testing,

467
00:30:22,632 --> 00:30:27,520
deny listing, looking at things like your EC, two security groups,

468
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,570
route 53,

469
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,508
if all of these AWS resources

470
00:30:34,604 --> 00:30:38,488
are well configured to prevent or to detect

471
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:41,300
or to even recover from ransomware.

472
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,276
So go check these resource out

473
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:50,004
and I'm sure that you're going to have

474
00:30:50,202 --> 00:30:54,536
some good insights as in where to start running

475
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:56,010
your game days from.

476
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,748
One important topic I want to talk about here is about continuous verification

477
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:05,624
of runbooks, right? So we all know that runbooks are extremely

478
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:09,132
helpful for security incident response and also

479
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:12,268
for even normal incident response. Basically,

480
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:15,784
runbooks carry these compose

481
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:20,064
of certain steps that are written that

482
00:31:20,102 --> 00:31:24,236
can be executed in an incident response scenarios

483
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:27,744
and which helps these operators to actually be a little

484
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:31,524
bit help the operators to be a little

485
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:34,532
bit proactive. Now,

486
00:31:34,586 --> 00:31:37,028
runbooks are very useful. However,

487
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:41,168
security incident response in cloud environment introduces a

488
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:45,492
lot of challenges, right? And these challenges kind of impact

489
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:49,224
or kind of limit how efficient runbooks can

490
00:31:49,262 --> 00:31:53,336
be. All right. One of the challenges is because in

491
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:57,048
the cloud infrastructure is constantly changing.

492
00:31:57,224 --> 00:32:00,728
Infrastructure is not static. Therefore,

493
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:04,044
this means that runbooks also cannot be

494
00:32:04,082 --> 00:32:07,980
static. Runbooks have to be updated periodically,

495
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,348
as often as possible. And also these

496
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:15,936
runbooks have to be aligned with the

497
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,720
current state of the infrastructure.

498
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,344
And this is very important because security teams, they gain

499
00:32:23,392 --> 00:32:26,580
confidence by exercising runbooks.

500
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,564
All right, before I conclude, I just want to highlight about some relevant

501
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:36,312
resources. Since I come from an academic research

502
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,556
background. During my doctoral

503
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:43,584
research, I did a lot of research about security Chaos

504
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:46,876
engineering. And some

505
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:52,412
of these papers are already published. And if

506
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:57,176
want good materials that will support your security chaos engineering journey.

507
00:32:57,368 --> 00:33:00,496
Yeah, these are some nice materials that will help you.

508
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:04,256
And I also had a chance to be one of the contributing authors to

509
00:33:04,278 --> 00:33:07,932
the first book on security chaos engineering.

510
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:11,536
And this was released last year. I was very lucky

511
00:33:11,568 --> 00:33:14,900
to be invited by Aaron Reinhardt and Kelly Shortridge.

512
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,712
And this book has also very good content around security chaos

513
00:33:19,776 --> 00:33:20,740
engineering.

514
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,224
All right, so this is the last slide. And,

515
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:30,520
yeah, just to mention some important points again.

516
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,480
Firstly, ransomware is a real threat.

517
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,848
Cloud environments are not immune to ransomware attacks

518
00:33:37,944 --> 00:33:41,404
they can suffer from, and there are attacks that happened in

519
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:44,984
real life. Also, security chaos engineering

520
00:33:45,032 --> 00:33:48,528
provides for you, means that you can verify your security

521
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:52,524
posture. And this includes ransomware. Right. You can use security chaos

522
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,984
engineering to check whether you are

523
00:33:56,022 --> 00:33:59,348
resistant to ransomware attack, to check

524
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:03,428
if whatever measure that

525
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:07,632
you have put in place to either detect

526
