00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,166
Hi everyone, my name is Megha Kadur and it's a great pleasure to

2
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:31,190
be presenting at Kube native 2022.

3
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,366
So today my talk is all about my journey into DevOps world.

4
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,598
How it all started actually. So before

5
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:42,182
beginning the presentation, let me give you an overview about the things

6
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:45,794
that I will be talking today. I'll start with my background

7
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:49,506
and then I'll talk about how I got introduced to DevOps

8
00:00:49,538 --> 00:00:52,766
World. Then what is this DevOps? What is

9
00:00:52,788 --> 00:00:56,622
its roles and responsibility? What DevOps is actually trying

10
00:00:56,676 --> 00:01:00,110
to solve in this it world. And then I'll talk about

11
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,306
things that you should know before starting your DevOps career

12
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:06,962
because I started from a non it background and there were many

13
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:10,734
things like I was unaware about. But in my DevOps journey

14
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:14,482
I got the opportunity to learn those things. So then I thought

15
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:18,078
okay, if I would have known these things beforehand, it would

16
00:01:18,104 --> 00:01:21,766
have actually helped me in fast tracking my career. So I'll be

17
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:25,590
sharing those things with you and the resources that actually helped me.

18
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,014
So let's begin with the presentation talking about my

19
00:01:29,052 --> 00:01:32,998
background. I have done ECE, electronics and communication engineering

20
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:36,522
and I have worked for almost three years in this domain. I started

21
00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:39,866
off as a testing engineer where I was testing the specification of

22
00:01:39,888 --> 00:01:43,902
the products and components. Later on I wasn't happy

23
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:47,354
with the job role that I was performing, so I started exploring

24
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:51,498
different career options. So that's when I got to know about DevOps

25
00:01:51,594 --> 00:01:54,638
and then I wanted to know how it works and what are the things.

26
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:58,306
So I started searching in Google like what is DevOps, how it

27
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:02,354
works, what are the skills required for that and many more. There was plenty of

28
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:06,498
information available about DevOps regarding its lifecycle and its tools.

29
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:09,362
Information like what tools can be used like dockers,

30
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:13,014
Jenkins, kubernetes, various other cloud providers like

31
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:16,614
AWS, Azure, GCP and many more. So it was

32
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:20,186
a lot of information for me to grasp at that time. So I

33
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:24,426
took one step back to understand what DevOps is

34
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:28,074
and why are we implementing DevOps culture and what

35
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:32,062
are the challenges thats DevOps is trying to solve. So let's try to

36
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:34,240
understand what DevOps is. Actually.

37
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,922
DevOps in simple term is an integration of development

38
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:43,710
and operation team. It tries to improve the collaboration and productivity.

39
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,954
Let us understand a simple software release cycle. So in order

40
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:50,658
to develop any application, it starts with the idea,

41
00:02:50,744 --> 00:02:54,766
gathering the information. Later on we plan it, plan the features

42
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:58,566
that needs to be included in the application. Then the developer writes the

43
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:02,310
code, testing of the code is done. Then we package

44
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,954
the application so that it can be deployed in the production

45
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,786
environment. And finally we monitor the application. So that's what

46
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:13,594
a simple software release cycle looks like.

47
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,706
So while developing the application, we might face challenges and problems

48
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:21,182
such as managing and tracking the changes in the code

49
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:24,846
is difficult. Manually testing of various components or

50
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:27,646
modules of the project takes a lot of time.

51
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:31,466
Incremental builds are difficult to manage, test and deploy,

52
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:35,442
ensuring consistency, adaptability and scalability across

53
00:03:35,496 --> 00:03:39,166
the environment becomes difficult. Also, due to lack

54
00:03:39,198 --> 00:03:42,786
of collaboration and miscommunication between various teams that are

55
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:46,514
working in a project, there is an uncertainty that whether

56
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:49,762
the code will work perfectly fine in the production environment

57
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:53,622
or not. We may also encounter issues such as

58
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:56,982
blame game where the dev team tells that the code is working

59
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,262
perfectly fine in their system, whereas the operation team

60
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:04,042
on the other hand tells that the environment is configured perfectly fine.

61
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:07,446
There must be some issue in your code. So this is a kind of blame

62
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:10,822
game that goes on. We may encounter unpredictable

63
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:14,234
issues in the production environment that had to be fixed

64
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:18,174
at an early stage. There will be release and deployment mismatch happening

65
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:21,230
and there will be lack of monitoring and feedback.

66
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,274
There comes DevOps, which is one solution for all problems.

67
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:29,826
DevOps is not a particular team nor a person. It's the

68
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:33,426
state of mind and we work in collaboration to solve the

69
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:37,334
issues and deliver the product on time. It's a culture and

70
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:41,750
implementation of best practices with the help of DevOps tools.

71
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,086
So I took an online course to understand how we can implement the

72
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,146
DevOps. And then in my DevOps journey I

73
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,890
started using many DevOps tools, but I had to still figure

74
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,034
out why am I using these tools. Then I started to

75
00:04:57,072 --> 00:05:00,938
understand the concepts like version control. What is CI

76
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:04,554
CD pipeline concept? What is infrastructure was code concept

77
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:08,510
and started relating these tools with the concept.

78
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,238
What is version control? Version control allows you to take snapshot

79
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:16,578
of your project. It allows multiple users to manage

80
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:19,460
multiple revision of the same unit of information.

81
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,874
Git is one of the famous version control tool and we

82
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:27,446
have GitHub.com was the code hosting platform

83
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:31,346
for collaboration and version control. Git records

84
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,758
the changes that are made to the file. So I started

85
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:38,586
familiarizing myself with these various git commands and

86
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:41,834
this is one of the tool thats you will require your

87
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:45,514
entire DevOps journey. So do learn git top

88
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:48,182
most demanding cloud platform are AWS,

89
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:52,014
GCP and Azure. We can start learning with any one of this

90
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:56,266
cloud platform. I started my cloud journey with Azure,

91
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:59,786
so all of these cloud providers have similar concept.

92
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:03,860
It's just that the naming and interfaces are little bit different.

93
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,274
Next concept is DevOps automation with infrastructure as

94
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:12,414
code infrastructure was code provides us a way to define

95
00:06:12,462 --> 00:06:15,734
our resources in a declarative manner and

96
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:19,202
put them together in a single unit called as configuration

97
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:22,390
file. Most of the cloud providers have their

98
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,102
own infrastructure. Automation like AWS is having

99
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:30,358
cloud formation, GCP is having Google deployment

100
00:06:30,454 --> 00:06:33,974
manager, and similarly Azure is having Azure resource

101
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:38,390
manager. So let's move on to some benefits speed.

102
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,894
It allows us to set up a complete infrastructure by just

103
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:45,354
running the scripts and we can do it for any environment

104
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:49,454
like dev to prod to QA. The next benefit is low

105
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,478
cost. It helps in lowering the cost of infrastructure management.

106
00:06:53,594 --> 00:06:56,654
We won't have to spend money on hardware or even rent

107
00:06:56,702 --> 00:07:00,130
any physical spaces to store them. The next

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,694
is increase efficiency. You can deploy your infrastructure

109
00:07:03,742 --> 00:07:07,474
architecture in many stages which makes the whole software

110
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:12,150
development cycle efficient tracing and increase the team production.

111
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,982
So the next benefit is consistency. Manual process

112
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:20,922
results in mistakes. So these tool helps us

113
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:24,330
in solving these issues by allowing us to write

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,618
the configuration files that can be deployed again and again

115
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:32,206
without any discrepancy. Let's move on

116
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:34,746
to next concept that is containers.

117
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:38,622
Containers are packages of software with all its

118
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:42,270
dependencies and libraries together to run in

119
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,982
any environment. Docker is the famous

120
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:49,474
containerization tool. It helps us to build the code at

121
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,594
developer side and finally ship the code and

122
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:56,326
run it in any environment. No matter it is dev,

123
00:07:56,428 --> 00:08:00,710
QA or prior environment, it will for sure run seamlessly.

124
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,898
Let's move on to next concept that is container orchestration.

125
00:08:05,074 --> 00:08:08,598
Kubernetes is popularly known as container orchestration

126
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:12,726
tool. It manages the availability, scaling and networking

127
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,262
of containers, monitoring the clusters and managing

128
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:19,894
the timing of the container creation. Consider this

129
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:22,762
rectangular space as Kubernetes cluster.

130
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:26,666
So what is a Kubernetes cluster? Cluster are considered

131
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:30,240
to be a set of nodes that run containerized application

132
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,478
and each cluster will have at least one worker node.

133
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:38,958
So what are nodes? Nodes are machine. They can be physical,

134
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:43,070
on prem or virtual. A node can have multiple pods

135
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,442
running in it. So what are pods? Pods are the smallest

136
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:51,394
unit of kubernetes. We can run single container or multiple

137
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:54,934
containers inside a pod and each worker node will

138
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:58,534
have multiple pods running and if a container stops or dies

139
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:01,878
inside a pod, it will automatically get restarted.

140
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:05,222
So let's move on to one other concept that is configuration

141
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:08,342
management. Once we have our infrastructure

142
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:12,618
provisioned the next step is to make sure thats everything is configured

143
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:16,302
so we can use various configuration tools such as

144
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:19,886
Ansible, chef, puppet, saw stack and

145
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:23,274
many more. Now we have CI CD concept.

146
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:26,622
CI CD is the backbone of DevOps continuous

147
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:30,146
integration and deployment is a series of steps that must

148
00:09:30,168 --> 00:09:33,918
be performed in order to deliver a new version of software.

149
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:37,058
It helps in improving the developer efficiency,

150
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:40,242
faster software build, easy to find bugs

151
00:09:40,306 --> 00:09:44,226
and improve collaboration. There are plenty of CI CD

152
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:47,282
tools available such as Jenkins Circle,

153
00:09:47,346 --> 00:09:51,354
CI drone, Azure pipelines, GitHub actions and

154
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:54,714
many more. So I started my DevOps journey from

155
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:58,886
Jenkins and then I started using Azure build and release pipelines

156
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:03,134
and many more. Nowadays IT companies are

157
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:06,634
adapting more of proper data analytics

158
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:10,234
and log management. So Grafana,

159
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:13,738
Prometheus, Ilk, Stack, Splunk, all these are

160
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:16,850
examples of monitoring and log management.

161
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,886
Let me share few things I wish I knew before starting my DevOps

162
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:25,474
career. Since I'm coming from a non IT background, there were

163
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:28,966
many things that I was unaware about. So then I thought that if

164
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:32,726
these things, if I would have known before, it would have actually helped me

165
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:37,074
in fast tracking my career. So the first thing is learning a programming

166
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:40,046
language. So I'll share one of my scenario,

167
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,578
like where I face challenges. So I

168
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:47,174
was assigned to a project and I was creating this build and release

169
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:51,034
pipeline. So at that time what happened is the pipeline used to fail with different

170
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:55,306
kinds of error and since I was not much aware about the programming language,

171
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:59,086
it was difficult for me to distinguish between the error. Is it because of

172
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,506
the code issue or is because of the configuration of the pipeline

173
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:06,606
that I have done? So in this way programming language

174
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:10,510
will actually help you. If I would have known those programming languages

175
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,046
beforehand, it would have actually helped me in identifying

176
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,574
those issues. So I prefer that in your

177
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:21,730
DevOps journey, learning a programming language is actually a benefit

178
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,510
and a plus point for us. So the other thing is

179
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,430
understanding the concepts. So usually when people

180
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,886
say that we want to change our career to DevOps

181
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:36,266
or some other career, we just think about the first thing thats comes into our

182
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:39,562
mind is like what are the tools that we need to learn

183
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,114
in order to get the job? But that's important. But that's not

184
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:46,398
the first thing. The first thing is that we need to understand the concept so

185
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:49,534
thats we can relate those tools with the concept and try

186
00:11:49,572 --> 00:11:53,902
to implement the DevOps culture in our project. So I

187
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:57,886
also had the same kind of issues. So then I started learning what DevOps

188
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,794
is and how it actually solves the problem, how it is

189
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:05,070
solving the problems and what are the roles and responsibilities.

190
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,386
So that's how I started learning DevOps

191
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:11,574
and I continued to work in DevOps domain. The other

192
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:14,562
things is learn any scripting language.

193
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:18,230
So this will actually help you in automating different

194
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,414
tasks. So when I was creating different build pipelines

195
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:24,954
and release pipeline. There were few steps where we had to write

196
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:28,602
the script and automate it. And at that time, as I said,

197
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,786
I wasn't aware about the scripting and since I'm coming from a non

198
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:36,046
it background, so I had to learn the scripting language and then

199
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:39,914
create the script and add it in the pipeline. So scripting

200
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:43,546
language is a kind of benefit. If you know it,

201
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:46,834
it will help you to automate your task. So the other thing is

202
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:51,182
communication and collaboration. So we feel communication and collaboration

203
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:54,450
is not important. But as much as

204
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,500
learning DevOps tools is important,

205
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,422
communication and collaboration is equally important because

206
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:04,118
if we have technical knowledge and if we are not able to convey that,

207
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:08,242
then it's very difficult to survive in this DevOps world. So initially

208
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:11,190
when I started my DevOps journey,

209
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,586
I was facing issues with communication also. So then slowly

210
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:18,982
I started to communicate with people, collaborate with people

211
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:22,410
trying to understand stand the different technologies and concepts.

212
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,366
So it's a kind of like collaboration and we were able to

213
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:30,394
solve the issues. So that's what communication and collaboration

214
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:34,046
is equally important. Thank you for joining my session and I
