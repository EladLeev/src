1
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,202
Chester Santos, the international man of Memory here.

2
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,830
My goal is to make this a very entertaining

3
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,730
and educational webinar.

4
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,954
Memory is a fundamental part of learning

5
00:02:00,072 --> 00:02:04,194
and the acquisition of knowledge. So improving your

6
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:07,930
memory skills is going to have a positive impact on

7
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,674
multiple areas of your life. In case you

8
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:15,478
might not be too familiar with myself and my background,

9
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:20,082
a two minute short video is going to play with some of my presentation

10
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,898
clips, media clips, and also my theme song.

11
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:30,462
Check it out. And then I'll be back with the webinar that

12
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:33,962
works. We just did some mental athletic training with Chester

13
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:37,174
Santos, who has the best memory in the United States, with ease.

14
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:41,182
Joining us right now is memory expert and winner of the 2008 USA national

15
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:44,846
Memory Championship, Chester Santos. If you have trouble remembering

16
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,514
names, faces, where you put your coffee task, well, if you do Chester Santos,

17
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:51,986
he can help. He's a 2008 national memory champion.

18
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:55,958
He is here to help us. Certainly knows he does. Chester Santos is the United

19
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:59,686
States memory champion. He captured the title this past weekend in

20
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:03,354
New York City. There he is accepting the prize. He's not. You can count or

21
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,690
see. He got the names of every conference.

22
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,278
You get it? Every sunny in a national. Who's the

23
00:03:11,364 --> 00:03:14,682
twelveth district New Jersey conference? Rush Holton.

24
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:18,698
Okay. Rush holter

25
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:22,526
wrapped up. Ten of hearts, three to go. Two of

26
00:03:22,548 --> 00:03:25,794
clubs. Yes. Jack of diamonds. You got it. And three

27
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,460
of diamonds. Unbelievable. That's incredible. First of all,

28
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,330
we have Carol, Rick,

29
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,250
Pedro, Jack, Andy.

30
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,154
We're dizzying ass every single time. He's got the power to

31
00:03:47,212 --> 00:03:50,250
educate, the power to thrill and memorize,

32
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,890
all wrapped up in invitation for mine.

33
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,940
He's your man.

34
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,018
Some of his techniques stretch all the way back to the ancient Greeks, but what's

35
00:04:09,034 --> 00:04:12,186
amazing is it's standing in front of you as a modern human being. I can

36
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:16,180
still feel those techniques reprogramming my brain to remember things better.

37
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,538
All right, we're back. You just saw my introductory video.

38
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:27,506
We're going to get started with the webinar. Now, I want you

39
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:30,982
to keep in mind that I might ask you to do some things

40
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:35,042
that can at certain times, seem a bit silly or unusual.

41
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:38,598
But please bear with me because I promise you that everything

42
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:41,914
that I ask you to do over the next hour or so,

43
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,194
it's really going to help you to dramatically improve your

44
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:48,954
ability to remember almost anything at all.

45
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:52,974
I'd like for you all to close your eyes at this

46
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:56,730
point. Close your eyes and just visualize

47
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,186
what I describe to you with your eyes closed.

48
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:04,806
I want for you to imagine yourself in your current residence.

49
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,414
You are in the living room area of your residence.

50
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,442
And you see there in the middle of your living room,

51
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:14,734
standing behind podiums, looking as if they're about to

52
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:18,898
engage in a debate. You see Donald Trump and Vladimir

53
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:22,086
Putin. Just see that in your mind. I know

54
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:26,134
it seems kind of out there unusual, but picture them

55
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:30,474
now actually debating in the middle of your living room.

56
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:33,990
Just see the debate unfold. It's becoming more and more heated

57
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,462
between the two politicians, Trump and Putin.

58
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:41,514
At one point, you see Donald Trump become visibly upset at

59
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:45,294
something that Putin says. So he reaches behind his podium to

60
00:05:45,332 --> 00:05:49,310
pull out a pie. He takes it, throws it at Putin, hits him square

61
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,310
in the face. You can see the pie dripping off of

62
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:57,234
Putin's face. Picture that he's not happy about

63
00:05:57,272 --> 00:06:00,914
it at all. So believe it or not, he now reaches behind his

64
00:06:00,952 --> 00:06:04,386
podium to also pull out a pie, takes it, throws it at

65
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,666
Trump. Splat. You can see the pie dripping

66
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:11,878
off Trump's face. Now, what started

67
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:15,062
off as a debate, turns out,

68
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:19,266
has now turned into a full blown pie fight. The politicians

69
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:23,446
are continuously throwing pies at each other. Pie is splattering

70
00:06:23,478 --> 00:06:26,746
all over the place. You can worry about who's going to clean up the

71
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:30,094
living room later. Just see this happening in

72
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:33,310
your mind to the best of your ability.

73
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,406
You are primarily experiencing at

74
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:41,034
this point, images running through your head, imagery.

75
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:44,574
I'd like you now to attempt to involve even more

76
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,426
senses as you experience this scenario happening.

77
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:51,570
Imagine that you can not only see it happening, you can hear it happening

78
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,858
as well. So you can hear the pie as it splatters

79
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:59,640
on the politicians. Imagine now

80
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,338
that you can smell the pie, stretch your imagination,

81
00:07:04,434 --> 00:07:08,102
really imagine what that pie might

82
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:11,818
smell like. So at this point, you can see

83
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:15,642
the pie fight happening. You can hear it. You can

84
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:19,254
smell it as well. Let's take it a step further.

85
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:22,906
I want for you to imagine that you walk up to one of the politicians,

86
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:26,526
you take some of the pie off of their face, feel it in

87
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:30,350
your hands, maybe it feels sort of sticky. Go ahead

88
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,142
now even put some of the pie in your mouth.

89
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:37,300
Go ahead and taste that pie.

90
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,842
Hopefully it's tasting pretty good to you there. Although a lot of people

91
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:46,280
tell me that it tastes like politician at this point.

92
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,774
All right, go ahead and open up your eyes.

93
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:54,134
Hopefully you enjoyed that exercise. A lot of people

94
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:58,310
find it to be a fun exercise. Usually pretty easy

95
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,282
for most people to complete that. But what in the world does

96
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:06,154
that have to do with improving your ability to

97
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:10,094
remember things? In fact, it has a lot to do with it. If you

98
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:13,150
were able to complete that simple exercise,

99
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,246
then you have the ability to remember anything at

100
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:21,374
all that you would ever want to remember quickly,

101
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:25,822
easily, and also with tremendous accuracy.

102
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:29,570
Here are some reasons why. Reason number one, I had you there.

103
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,526
Exercise your visualization ability,

104
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,694
and your visual memory is incredibly powerful.

105
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:38,786
An example that I like to cite in my presentations

106
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:42,902
around the world is a situation that we can all relate to.

107
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:46,470
We might see someone that we could have met

108
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,074
years ago. We may have met that person years in the past.

109
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:53,722
Oftentimes right away, as soon as we see their face,

110
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,866
we remember their face. We know that we've met them somewhere before,

111
00:08:58,048 --> 00:09:00,838
but we can't seem to remember their name.

112
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:04,990
Right. Pretty common experience. Something else

113
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,686
that we can relate to. Let's say you go to a party. You go to

114
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:11,934
a party, you're meeting a lot of new people.

115
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:15,454
Two weeks after that party is over, you're talking with

116
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:18,498
one of your friends that was at the party with you,

117
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:21,794
and your friend describes someone to you that you had both

118
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:25,506
met. Your friend says, hey, do you remember that attorney that we

119
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:28,994
met at the party a couple of weeks ago? He's also a member

120
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:32,262
of the tennis club. As your friend is going

121
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:35,734
through the description of the person from the party, a lot of times

122
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:39,154
you can picture who they're describing in your mind.

123
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:43,414
You might even be able to remember what that person was wearing

124
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,334
that night when you met them. But a lot of times, you can't seem

125
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:52,110
to remember the name, and it's very frustrating.

126
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,950
A third and final example related to this.

127
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,662
How many times have you been describing to a friend or

128
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:03,706
family member an actor from a tv show or movie?

129
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:07,234
As you're going through this description, crystal clear in your mind,

130
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:10,834
you can picture the actor that you're describing. Your friend

131
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:14,418
or family member can also picture who you're describing, but neither one of

132
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:18,258
you can come up with the name at that moment, and it's really frustrating

133
00:10:18,354 --> 00:10:21,686
to both of you. Those three examples that I just

134
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:25,494
went over all illustrate pretty well that when it comes to

135
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:28,690
dealing with people, we tend to be pretty good

136
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,490
at remembering faces, but we are not

137
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,106
nearly as good at remembering names. When you think

138
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:39,962
about it, this makes a lot of sense, because when we are interacting with people

139
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:43,598
in various ways, we always see the face,

140
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,562
right? We see their face. The face is recorded into our visual

141
00:10:47,706 --> 00:10:51,246
memory, but at no point do we see their name. The name is

142
00:10:51,268 --> 00:10:54,414
something much more abstract to your brain.

143
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:58,402
So one way that you can get better at remembering names is

144
00:10:58,456 --> 00:11:02,350
to turn the name somehow into a visual,

145
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,118
something that you can picture in your mind.

146
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:09,682
For instance, Mike might become a microphone

147
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:13,234
for the name Alice. Sometimes I picture a white rabbit

148
00:11:13,282 --> 00:11:16,790
because that reminds me of Alice in Wonderland.

149
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,034
That's how I open presentations around the world. I've given

150
00:11:21,072 --> 00:11:24,838
presentations in more than 30 different countries at this point. A lot of times I'll

151
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:27,990
open with naming hundreds of people in the audience

152
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,070
after just hearing each name one time.

153
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,210
It's because I'm turning those names into powerful visuals.

154
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,006
I'm going to get into remembering names in much more detail

155
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:42,734
toward the end of this webinar, so look

156
00:11:42,772 --> 00:11:47,122
out for that. But for now, what I want for you to note is

157
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:51,060
the power of your visual memory. When you can take information

158
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,686
that you want to remember and turn it into something that you can picture

159
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:58,674
in your mind, it's going to make that information so much easier

160
00:11:58,722 --> 00:12:02,038
to remember it later on when you need it.

161
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,798
The second principle to take away from the simple

162
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:09,162
exercise with Trump and Putin is that after

163
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:12,842
I had you visualize, I then had you start to get

164
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:17,062
more and more senses involved from there. As you activate

165
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:20,554
more and more senses in the encoding process, when trying

166
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:24,842
to get information into your memory, what's happening is you are activating

167
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:29,146
more and more areas of your brain, and you are building more and more connections

168
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:32,834
in your mind to the information, making it

169
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:36,542
easier to retrieve it later. So I starred in an episode

170
00:12:36,606 --> 00:12:40,462
of PBS's Nova Science. The episode

171
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:44,190
that I starred in was entitled how smart

172
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,082
can we get? Or it might be easier to just Google Chester Santos,

173
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:51,622
that's me, and PBS. And you'll probably find

174
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:55,350
the clip. Anyone can watch the entire episode for free

175
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,742
on the PBS website. Maybe take a look at it at some point.

176
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:02,474
If you do, you'll see me on the show performing what at first

177
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:06,374
seemed like pretty crazy memory feats. And then they had me train David

178
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:09,658
Pogue, who was the host of the show. You might also know him from the

179
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:13,978
New York Times and CBS News. He's a correspondent for the technology industry.

180
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:17,198
I trained him on the show, and after just a little bit

181
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:20,874
of training, he was then able to perform some pretty cool memory

182
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:24,602
feats. After that, they had some neuroscientists,

183
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:27,586
brain scientists, come on the show and explain,

184
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:31,234
okay, how in the world did Chester pull that off?

185
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:35,042
How did David Pogue do it? With just a little bit of training, and these

186
00:13:35,096 --> 00:13:39,090
brain scientists confirmed that it's because with these memory techniques

187
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,214
that I've mastered over the years and that you're going to learn

188
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:46,438
about during the short webinar today, what's happening is we're recruiting extra

189
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:50,310
areas of the brain, areas of the brain that most people worlds

190
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,594
never involve when trying to commit things to memory. With these

191
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:57,386
techniques, we're activating more and more areas of the brain to help us,

192
00:13:57,408 --> 00:14:00,446
so it becomes so much easier to remember things. Part of

193
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:04,394
this is learning to utilize additional senses.

194
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:08,142
The more senses you involve, again, the more of the brain is

195
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:11,230
activated, the easier it is to remember.

196
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,330
Keep that in mind. Third and final principle is

197
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,070
that in addition to seeing all of this and experiencing

198
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,182
it with additional senses, I made the entire scenario

199
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:26,974
with Trump and Putin very strange, right? Unusual.

200
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:30,342
You would never expect to see that happening in the middle

201
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:33,606
of your living room. I had you do that because I'd like for you to

202
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:37,442
learn to take advantage of the psychological aspect

203
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:41,466
to human memory that is all of us. With putting forth little to

204
00:14:41,488 --> 00:14:45,270
no effort, we tend to remember things that catch us by surprise,

205
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,938
that are strange, extraordinary in some way, right?

206
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:52,174
If this were to actually happen right now

207
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,822
at this moment, wherever you are watching this

208
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:59,454
webinar, if an elephant crashed into

209
00:14:59,492 --> 00:15:03,474
the room right now at this moment and started to spray water all

210
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:07,442
over you with its trunk, if that actually happened at this moment,

211
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:11,074
you would probably remember that for the rest of your

212
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:14,740
life and always tell that story.

213
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,790
It might be stuck there forever without you even putting forth any

214
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,174
effort to commit that to memory. To this day,

215
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:26,646
it still isn't fully understood how that works in the

216
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:30,442
brain. How sometimes in one instant, something will go

217
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,990
straight into long term memory and stay there forever.

218
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,546
Whereas other times, when we have really important

219
00:15:37,648 --> 00:15:41,078
things that we need to get into long term memory, we have a lot of

220
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:44,158
difficulty doing it. We can spend weeks, months,

221
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:47,582
trying to get things in the long term memory. Although this

222
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:51,134
isn't fully understood, we do realize that

223
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:54,670
there is this psychological aspect to human memory.

224
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,482
Realizing that we can harness that power and apply

225
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:01,746
it to things that would be very useful for

226
00:16:01,768 --> 00:16:05,206
us to remember names and faces, to get more out of

227
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:08,742
business networking, and to build better relationships with people

228
00:16:08,796 --> 00:16:10,950
in general. Presentations,

229
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,594
important business related facts and figures,

230
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:18,630
foreign language, vocabulary, exam material,

231
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,586
and so on. There are so many practical applications for

232
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:26,714
an improved ability to remember things. When you combine the three

233
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,930
principles that we just went over, visualization,

234
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,694
utilizing additional senses from there, and you

235
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:37,758
also use your creativity and imagination to make

236
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:41,194
what you are seeing and experiencing crazy, unusual,

237
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:45,106
extraordinary. When you put that together right away,

238
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:48,706
it becomes easier to remember just about anything

239
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:53,118
at all. We're going to put this into practice now, all right? Without training

240
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:56,814
anything down, without using any sort of electronic

241
00:16:56,862 --> 00:17:00,466
device to help you, you'll be using nothing but your brain and memory.

242
00:17:00,498 --> 00:17:04,214
Here. I know people aren't used to doing this nowadays. I'm going to have

243
00:17:04,252 --> 00:17:07,434
you attempt to commit to memory the following random list of

244
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:10,890
words. It's going to be monkey,

245
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,450
iron, rope,

246
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,180
kite, house, paper,

247
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,090
shoe, worm,

248
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,986
envelope, pencil,

249
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:26,590
river, rock, tree,

250
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,254
cheese, and dollar. All right?

251
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:34,314
Now, when I recite that list of words to live audiences,

252
00:17:34,362 --> 00:17:37,330
I get people in the audience looking at me as if, come on, man,

253
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,894
there's no way I'm going to be able to remember that. Not unless

254
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:44,306
you give me a lot of time to do it. But in fact, all of

255
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:47,574
you watching this webinar, you're all going to have it committed to

256
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:51,490
memory perfectly, forwards and backwards.

257
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,506
With just about three minutes of study time and with no further

258
00:17:55,538 --> 00:17:59,270
review necessary. Even weeks from now, you will skills know

259
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,570
those words forwards and backwards. They will be locked into

260
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,866
your memory. How you're going to pull this off. Just listen to

261
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:09,658
what I described to you. See and experience it happening in your mind,

262
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:13,102
just as you did in the opening exercise with Trump

263
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:16,510
and Putin. Same approach. The whole key to this,

264
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,222
and probably one of the most important things to get out of the short

265
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:24,126
webinar today, is to hopefully shift your approach just a

266
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:27,214
little bit when it comes to any sort of memory task.

267
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:30,210
Remembering names, giving a presentation, whatever it might be,

268
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,602
rather than coming at it, as we usually do, as a

269
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:37,362
difficult and boring exercise in memory.

270
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:41,670
Try to come at it more as just a fun opportunity to use

271
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,314
your creativity and your imagination. That small shift

272
00:18:45,362 --> 00:18:49,074
in your approach will make a huge difference in your ability

273
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:53,114
to remember things you saw in the intro video, the two minute video

274
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:56,506
with some of my tv clips. You saw one of my CNN clips there.

275
00:18:56,528 --> 00:19:00,026
I had to memorize during the commercial break, all right? Only had about two

276
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:03,342
minutes to do it. Then they came back live on the air.

277
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:07,214
I had to recite that, all of those cards from memory, if you

278
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:11,066
pay attention, you'll see that while I'm memorizing the cards,

279
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:14,574
I'm smiling, I'm giggling. I think they thought

280
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,162
that I was a little bit crazy or nutty when I was on that show.

281
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:21,666
But really, that's the key. If you all are smiling and

282
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:25,394
giggling while you're going through this exercise, it's a good

283
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:28,694
sign that you're going to remember all the words. So just have fun with

284
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:31,894
it. It'll be very easy. Let's do it.

285
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:35,890
Now, visualize what I described to you. The first word was monkey.

286
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,002
So I want for you to just see a monkey in your mind,

287
00:19:39,056 --> 00:19:42,710
all right? This monkey is dancing around, making monkey

288
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,554
noises. Whatever a monkey would sound like,

289
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:49,946
I'm working on my monkey impression. Okay, the point here is

290
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:54,206
to see and hear the monkey. The monkey now

291
00:19:54,308 --> 00:19:57,838
picks up a gigantic iron, because that was

292
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:01,594
the next word. So just see this like a movie or cartoon

293
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:05,374
playing in your head. However you can best visualize it. You've got a monkey

294
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:08,306
dancing around with a giant iron. At this point,

295
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,694
the iron starts to fall. But a rope attaches

296
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:15,074
itself to the iron. Maybe even feel the

297
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:18,386
rope. Maybe it feels sort of rough. Really interact with it.

298
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:21,794
You look up the rope, and you see that the other end of the rope

299
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:25,366
is attached to a kite. That kite is flying around in the

300
00:20:25,388 --> 00:20:28,982
air. Maybe you reach up and try and touch it. It might just be

301
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:32,090
right just out of your reach. That kite. The kite now

302
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,482
crashes into the side of a house. Really see it

303
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:39,386
smash into that house. The house, you notice is completely

304
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,278
covered in paper. For some reason, it's covered in paper.

305
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:46,826
Picture that. Out of nowhere, a shoe appears,

306
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:50,446
and it starts to walk all over the paper. Maybe it's messing up

307
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:53,846
the paper as it's walking on it. That shoe. The shoe

308
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:57,326
skills pretty badly. So you decide to investigate

309
00:20:57,438 --> 00:21:00,674
and see why. You look inside of the shoe and you find

310
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:04,606
a little worm crawling around. See that smelly worm crawling

311
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,594
inside the shoe? Worm was the next word. The worm now jumps

312
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,426
out of the shoe and into an envelope.

313
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:14,582
Maybe it's going to mail itself or something. I don't know.

314
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:18,214
Envelope was the next word. A pencil

315
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:22,486
appears out of thin air. It starts to write all over the envelope.

316
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:26,294
Maybe it's addressing it. The pencil. The pencil

317
00:21:26,342 --> 00:21:30,074
now jumps into a river. And there is a

318
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:33,386
huge splash when that little pencil hits

319
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:37,530
the river. River was next. The river, you see is crashing up against a giant

320
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,018
rock. All right, really see it crashing into that rock.

321
00:21:41,114 --> 00:21:44,290
The rock flies out of the river and into a tree.

322
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,982
Picture that tree. This tree is growing cheese.

323
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:51,678
You probably haven't seen a tree like that before. This tree

324
00:21:51,694 --> 00:21:55,042
is growing cheese. Out of each piece of cheese shoots

325
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,994
a dollar. The last word was dollar.

326
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:02,902
I'm going to go through this again very quickly, and your

327
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:07,014
job at this point is to simply replay through this

328
00:22:07,052 --> 00:22:11,002
little story that you've created in your mind. So we started off with

329
00:22:11,056 --> 00:22:14,986
the monkey. What was the monkey dancing around with? It was

330
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:18,986
dancing around with an iron. What attached itself to the

331
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:22,782
iron? It was a rope. The other end of the rope was attached to what?

332
00:22:22,836 --> 00:22:26,510
It was a kite. What did the kite crash into?

333
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,346
It was a house. What was the house covered

334
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:33,954
in? It was covered in paper. What walked on it.

335
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:37,474
It was a shoe. What was changing in the

336
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:40,926
shoe? It was a worm. The worm jumped

337
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,758
into what? It was an envelope,

338
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:47,730
right? What wrote on the envelope? It was a pencil.

339
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,730
The pencil then jumped into what? It was a river.

340
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,282
The river was crashing up against the rock.

341
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:58,086
That flew into what? It was a tree.

342
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:00,198
What was it growing?

343
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:03,546
Cheese. And what shot out?

344
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:06,806
A dollar. Right? The last word was dollar.

345
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:10,970
Now, you should be able to recall pretty easily

346
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,730
the entire random list of words by simply

347
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,270
going through that story in your mind. And each

348
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,174
major object that you encounter in the story will give you the

349
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:25,506
next word if you'd like. At some point,

350
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:29,294
you can just pause the webinar and see if you can recite

351
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:32,946
those words forwards and then maybe even attempt to

352
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:36,086
recite them backwards. If you do that, I'm pretty sure

353
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:39,398
you're going to get close to 100% correct.

354
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:43,474
This technique is called the story method.

355
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:47,842
It is just one of many techniques that memory champions

356
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:51,322
like myself use to pull off what at first seemed like

357
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:55,162
extraordinary feats of memory. But really, it's just about the right

358
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:59,034
techniques, a little bit of training and practice. My brain is not different from

359
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:03,322
anyone else's. I've just learned powerful

360
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:06,414
techniques and gone through a little bit of training.

361
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,774
You can do this as well. And again,

362
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:13,770
this will give you an advantage in just about

363
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,490
any career. This is going to be very useful in various ways

364
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,650
in your personal life and also for the kids

365
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,682
that you have in school. This will cut their study time.

366
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:29,746
It will improve their retention of information. This provides

367
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:33,014
them with a much more fun and interesting framework to

368
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:36,726
use when they have to commit things to memory for school. If you

369
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:40,202
will stick to this type of training with the story method and

370
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:43,850
other similar types of techniques, you will notice many

371
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,830
benefits over time. Benefit number one, your memory

372
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,834
is going to improve over time in general, even independent

373
00:24:51,882 --> 00:24:55,834
of using the techniques. But that's only if, after the webinar

374
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:59,342
today, you force yourself to commit more and more things

375
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:02,480
to memory and recall them.

376
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,574
Your memory will then improve because your brain is very trainable.

377
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:10,994
The more you force your brain to perform a particular function over

378
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:15,346
and over again, the more it signals to your brain that that's something important

379
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:19,366
that you need to be able to do. So your brain finds a

380
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:22,982
way to make itself better at

381
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:26,694
doing it. There was a segment on a science program about a guy who was

382
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:29,814
in a very unfortunate accident, and a pole

383
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,674
went through a certain area of his brain, and he completely lost the ability to

384
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:38,678
perform certain functions. What happened, though, is with rehabilitation

385
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:42,362
and training, the brain rewired

386
00:25:42,426 --> 00:25:46,106
itself, other areas of his brain took over. So areas

387
00:25:46,138 --> 00:25:49,534
of the brain that most people would have nothing to do with

388
00:25:49,572 --> 00:25:53,666
performing those functions, they took over, and he regained the

389
00:25:53,688 --> 00:25:57,646
ability to perform not all, but many of those functions

390
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:01,182
due to rewiring of his brain.

391
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:04,318
With training, your brain's incredibly trainable.

392
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:08,070
The opposite is, however, true. If you

393
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:11,334
never have your brain perform a particular function,

394
00:26:11,452 --> 00:26:15,746
if you're always writing everything down, if you're always entering

395
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:19,106
things into electronic devices, what you're saying to your brain

396
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:22,234
is, you know what, at this point in my life, it's not

397
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:25,706
important for me to be able to remember things anymore. So it

398
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:29,530
makes sense that you are going to start to lose that ability

399
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,870
over time. We are living in an age of

400
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,710
perhaps dangerous digital dependency.

401
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,082
People are losing not only their memory ability,

402
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:44,914
but also other mental functions due to becoming too

403
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:47,710
dependent on electronic devices.

404
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,250
An example I'll give you. We all used to be able to remember

405
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,546
the phone numbers of so many friends and family members, right?

406
00:26:54,568 --> 00:26:58,086
We could easily dial those from memory. I remember when I was

407
00:26:58,108 --> 00:27:01,894
growing up, my parents would also give me some emergency numbers that they

408
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:05,094
thought were important for me to know. We could all do that.

409
00:27:05,132 --> 00:27:08,922
But nowadays, you give somebody even one phone

410
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:12,106
number and they feel paralyzed, they can't do it.

411
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:16,006
It's getting so bad that there are people out there today that don't

412
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:19,162
even know their own phone number.

413
00:27:19,216 --> 00:27:23,530
It's a really good example of the use it or lose it principle

414
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,466
as it applies to memory. Another quick example, navigation.

415
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:31,694
You have people. I'll give Uber and Lyft drivers as

416
00:27:31,732 --> 00:27:35,634
an example. In some cases, they may have been driving in a

417
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:39,442
city for three, four plus years. But if

418
00:27:39,496 --> 00:27:43,166
something is wrong with the app at that time, if there's

419
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:46,526
something wrong with the network connection, a lot of

420
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:50,002
times they can't take you to even very commonly known

421
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:53,718
landmarks in a city. They will need to pull over,

422
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:57,234
restart their phone, until hopefully the issue with the app

423
00:27:57,292 --> 00:28:00,298
resolves or the network connection comes back.

424
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,386
Because for those three, four plus years,

425
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:07,658
they have been 100% dependent on

426
00:28:07,744 --> 00:28:11,414
the gps. They've completely shut off their

427
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:15,246
brains, so haven't even learned a few simple

428
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:18,526
streets. The same is happening with taxi drivers. Taxi drivers used

429
00:28:18,548 --> 00:28:22,586
to be world famous for their memory ability. I know New York City

430
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:25,122
and London taxi drivers. At one point,

431
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:28,862
universities were even doing research on their brains

432
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:32,210
because they had just an extraordinary ability to remember

433
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,798
even thousands of streets. But nowadays, I've been in a taxi in

434
00:28:35,804 --> 00:28:39,478
San Francisco, and it just isn't the same anymore due to

435
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:43,080
dependency on gps. So just be a little bit

436
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,730
aware that we want to be a

437
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,934
bit careful with too much digital dependency.

438
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,474
Try to use your brain, definitely try to use your

439
00:28:54,512 --> 00:28:58,518
memory when you can. I get people in my seminars

440
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:01,950
all the time that tell me, hey, you know, when I was back in school,

441
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,422
Chester, I was pretty good at remembering things,

442
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:09,674
but now I'm having really a lot of difficulty remembering

443
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:13,710
things on the job. They're sending us to new trainings and I don't have that

444
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,034
ability to commit all of this information to memory like I did

445
00:29:18,232 --> 00:29:21,282
back in my schooling years. When you think about it, this makes

446
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:24,934
sense because then you were using your memory all the time,

447
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,722
right? So when we are in preschool,

448
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:32,822
elementary school, junior high, high school,

449
00:29:32,876 --> 00:29:36,358
grad school, for some people through that entire block of years,

450
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:40,434
you're challenged to learn tons of information from a wide

451
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:44,074
variety of areas. You're tested on your recall of the information,

452
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:47,546
for quizzes, exams, to write papers. When you first start a

453
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:50,602
new job, when you do the on the job,

454
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:53,966
onboarding, right. The onboard training. You have to learn a lot

455
00:29:53,988 --> 00:29:57,834
of new things in order to perform your job functions properly.

456
00:29:57,882 --> 00:30:00,702
But then what happens to a lot of us is we enter this 30,

457
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:04,442
40 plus year period where things start to become a routine.

458
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:08,082
We're doing the same types of things day in and day out.

459
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:12,254
We're not really challenged to use our memory as much on a regular

460
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:15,654
basis. So when we are suddenly presented with something

461
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:19,250
new to learn, we feel like our memory capabilities

462
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,610
have been diminished. The positive aspect

463
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,534
of this is if you make it a point to actually exercise your

464
00:30:26,572 --> 00:30:29,974
memory, exercise your brain in general as well,

465
00:30:30,092 --> 00:30:33,498
you can keep your memory strong and really in fact

466
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:37,562
improve it at any age. Now, some people don't believe

467
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:40,442
me when I tell them this. A lot of people are stuck on this idea

468
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:44,266
that someone older in age is going to have a memory worse

469
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:48,286
than someone younger in age. And that's just the way things are. So I like

470
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:51,758
to talk about two things. One, I represented the United States

471
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:55,586
in the World Memory Championship. It was held in the

472
00:30:55,608 --> 00:30:58,834
Middle east when I represented the United States. There was a guy

473
00:30:58,872 --> 00:31:02,242
there from Malaysia in his late sixty s, so more than

474
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:06,034
thirty years older than me. He destroyed me in this competition.

475
00:31:06,082 --> 00:31:10,162
Okay? He kicked my butt really badly. In the world memory championship.

476
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:13,842
He actually memorized the entire dictionary, advanced Learners

477
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:17,366
edition in English and Chinese. He did

478
00:31:17,388 --> 00:31:20,854
a demonstration for people in the audience and for people

479
00:31:20,892 --> 00:31:24,378
from the media that were there watching. They would call out any page number in

480
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:28,186
the dictionary and give a row column combination. Within a

481
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,542
few seconds, he could tell you the word there and its definition

482
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:35,146
from memory. He could even do the reverse. If you just called out a random

483
00:31:35,178 --> 00:31:39,006
word like chair, he would say, okay, chair, I think that's on

484
00:31:39,028 --> 00:31:42,206
page 737, row four. And he was

485
00:31:42,228 --> 00:31:45,530
right every single time. He's known as the walking

486
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,294
dictionary. Dr. Yipswei Choi from Malaysia.

487
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:52,894
These are the types of guys that you get at the world memory championship.

488
00:31:52,942 --> 00:31:56,706
It's pretty intense over there, but it goes to show he was in his late

489
00:31:56,738 --> 00:32:00,134
sixty s. So even later in your years you can have

490
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:03,762
an extraordinary memory ability. But he is constantly

491
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:07,494
training his memory with these types of techniques that

492
00:32:07,532 --> 00:32:10,646
we're talking about on today's webinar.

493
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:14,534
Second example, I've been teaching a one day memory training workshop

494
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:18,362
in San Francisco for more than twelve years,

495
00:32:18,416 --> 00:32:22,106
and now I have an online equivalent memory school. But I've gotten

496
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:26,494
people in the San Francisco seminar that from

497
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:30,126
all over the world and all different age ranges I

498
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,246
have seen in that workshop, people in their sixty s

499
00:32:33,268 --> 00:32:37,026
and seventy s completely outperform working professionals in

500
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:40,174
their twenty s and thirty s in terms of the memory

501
00:32:40,222 --> 00:32:43,806
tasks in the workshop. And when I talk to those people, it turns

502
00:32:43,838 --> 00:32:47,666
out that they not only sign up for things like memory workshops,

503
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:51,634
they take language classes. They're always keeping very mentally

504
00:32:51,682 --> 00:32:54,626
active, attending art functions,

505
00:32:54,818 --> 00:32:57,778
museum events, they're really exercising,

506
00:32:57,874 --> 00:33:01,770
challenging their brain at all times. And I think that

507
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,066
is they're really dedicated to lifelong learning. And I

508
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:08,806
really think that is at least part of the reason how they're staying so razor

509
00:33:08,838 --> 00:33:12,646
sharp even later in their years. So you can improve

510
00:33:12,678 --> 00:33:16,698
your memory, remain razor sharp at any age. If you stick

511
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:20,094
to the type of training we're going to be talking about today, you will keep

512
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:24,134
your memory strong, improve it at any age. Also, visualization ability

513
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,922
will improve. You'll create these images in your mind more quickly.

514
00:33:28,056 --> 00:33:32,238
You'll be able to see the imagery more clearly. And visualization

515
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:36,082
ability has been linked in many studies to more than memory.

516
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:40,022
It's been linked to overall intelligence. In fact,

517
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:43,606
if you can take complex information and turn

518
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:47,394
it into a simple series of images that you can visualize,

519
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:51,578
see in your mind, it helps to improve your understanding as well.

520
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:54,794
So visualization, another important thing that you can

521
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,522
develop with this type of training. This is also very good

522
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:01,722
exercise in creativity and imagination,

523
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:05,802
coming up with these creative and imaginative stories. In addition,

524
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:09,262
this is really good exercise for your brain in general.

525
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:13,310
And everyone is recommending nowadays a brain exercise

526
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:17,618
program in addition to a physical exercise program.

527
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:21,902
With the current research, if you're destined to develop Alzheimer's

528
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:25,394
or another form of dementia. Unfortunately, there is

529
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:29,730
no doctor, no researcher that can tell you how to prevent

530
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,666
that from happening. But what they do believe is that by engaging

531
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:37,186
in rigorous brain exercise, you can build up what they're

532
00:34:37,218 --> 00:34:40,860
calling cognitive reserve. If you were to look that up right now,

533
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,826
google it, or otherwise look it up, cognitive reserve is the

534
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:48,538
terminology that you'll find used in the research. This basically

535
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:52,014
means building up some extra brain muscle, and they think that

536
00:34:52,052 --> 00:34:55,614
it might help to make you more resistant to some

537
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:59,582
forms of dementia if you do, unfortunately develop

538
00:34:59,636 --> 00:35:03,262
it down the line. One of the best ways to develop cognitive reserve

539
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:06,914
research supports learning foreign languages can

540
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:11,262
really build up some extra brain muscle, extra brain connections.

541
00:35:11,326 --> 00:35:14,702
Of course, learning languages is going to be easier for you

542
00:35:14,776 --> 00:35:19,270
if you master memory skills techniques.

543
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,930
Now, we've covered so far the story method

544
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:26,630
with random words. I want to make it clear

545
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,362
before we move on to names, which is coming

546
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:34,570
up, I want to make it clear first that this won't apply to just

547
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,406
random words. This can apply to even very complex

548
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:41,674
types of information as well. So not just monkey,

549
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,882
iron, rope. I was a speaker at Harvard University.

550
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:49,962
You can find on my website a testimonial from the Harvard

551
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:53,054
Graduate Council. So I gave a seminar for

552
00:35:53,092 --> 00:35:56,546
and then one large seminar for hundreds of students over at

553
00:35:56,568 --> 00:36:00,002
Harvard, and then smaller, more in depth training after that.

554
00:36:00,056 --> 00:36:04,146
I had Harvard medical students, law students, business students

555
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,974
in the programs. Even very complex types of information

556
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:12,278
can be tackled. It's about building mental note cards or

557
00:36:12,364 --> 00:36:16,850
mental cue cards that remind you of something more complex.

558
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,442
You'll have a better idea. As we go through one more short exercise,

559
00:36:21,586 --> 00:36:25,386
I want for you to just visualize what I described to you. See and

560
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:29,126
experience it happening in your mind as best you can. This will take a minute

561
00:36:29,158 --> 00:36:32,842
or two, really easy. I want for you to visualize some giant

562
00:36:32,906 --> 00:36:36,810
machines. Just see that, picture it. Some giant machines.

563
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,666
These giant machines are smashing up a huge pile of gold

564
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,906
and silver, right? Smashing up a huge pile of gold and

565
00:36:43,928 --> 00:36:47,086
silver. Those machines, out of the gold

566
00:36:47,118 --> 00:36:50,914
and silver vehicles rise up. See these

567
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:54,702
vehicles? Whatever that looks like to you. And shooting

568
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:58,114
out of the windows of the vehicles, a bunch of medicine.

569
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:01,846
Maybe you see pill bottles or syringes or something. Medicine is

570
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:05,366
shooting out of the windows and exploding out of the

571
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:08,834
medicine. Oil, maybe black petroleum

572
00:37:08,882 --> 00:37:12,234
oil would be easiest to visualize. Oil explodes out of the

573
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:15,562
medicine. That was it. This one really is very

574
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:18,826
quick and easy. I'm going to run through the imagery again, replay through

575
00:37:18,848 --> 00:37:22,766
it in your mind. We had these giant machines were smashing up what they

576
00:37:22,788 --> 00:37:26,874
were smashing up gold and silver. What rose

577
00:37:26,922 --> 00:37:30,714
up vehicles. What shot out of the windows

578
00:37:30,762 --> 00:37:33,518
of the vehicles? It was medicine.

579
00:37:33,694 --> 00:37:37,662
What exploded out of the medicine? It was oil.

580
00:37:37,806 --> 00:37:41,154
What you have just done there, I'm sure you can

581
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,686
recite those items back. You've just memorized the

582
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:47,874
top five exports of the UK.

583
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:51,154
So if you were to look up some of the UK's top exports,

584
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:54,070
you'll find listed machinery,

585
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,110
precious metals,

586
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,450
vehicles,

587
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,654
pharmaceuticals and oil.

588
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:07,990
So you see there how the images don't need to perfectly

589
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,358
match what you're trying to remember. Those simple

590
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:14,762
images serve as note cards, mental note cards,

591
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:18,126
to remind you of something a little bit broader when

592
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:20,030
you are meeting with clients,

593
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,790
potential clients, or it's a presentation

594
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,378
in front of colleagues, when you have just 510

595
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:31,294
15 key things that you're able to recite,

596
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,038
demonstrate that. You know that, right? You're demonstrating your expertise,

597
00:38:35,134 --> 00:38:39,538
you're showing that you actually know your stuff. You are so much more impressive.

598
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:43,526
You are perceived to be more of an expert in your particular

599
00:38:43,628 --> 00:38:46,982
field. People start to have more confidence in you and

600
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:50,422
your ability when you have a razor sharp memory.

601
00:38:50,486 --> 00:38:53,674
And just a little bit of memory skills training will go

602
00:38:53,712 --> 00:38:57,782
a long way. We talked about it earlier, people are very digitally

603
00:38:57,846 --> 00:39:01,094
dependent. In today's business environment,

604
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:04,894
people can't remember even a small amount of information. So a little bit

605
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:07,950
in terms of memory skills training will go a long way towards

606
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,502
setting you apart, making you more impressive and you will be

607
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:15,826
more memorable in the business world.

608
00:39:16,008 --> 00:39:19,122
Of course, as I mentioned earlier, this is

609
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:23,282
also huge for kids that you have in

610
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:26,654
school. This is going to cut study time, improve retention.

611
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:30,294
Kids find this to be a much more interesting and

612
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:33,618
fun methodology to use to commit things to memory,

613
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:37,046
as I mentioned earlier. Let's move on now to one of my

614
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,714
more popular topics. No matter what

615
00:39:40,832 --> 00:39:43,978
type of group I might be talking to around the world,

616
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:47,482
it's always going to be names. Because names we know is

617
00:39:47,616 --> 00:39:51,402
remembering names is important in just about any career. It's important

618
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:54,974
in everyone's personal life. I like to

619
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:59,162
quote the book how to win friends and influence

620
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:02,206
people. You may have heard of it to this day, it's still one of the

621
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:06,142
most popular business and personal success books ever written.

622
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:09,650
In that book, it was written that the sweetest sound to a person in

623
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,506
any language is the sound of their own name,

624
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:17,494
and also that everyone's favorite subject is themselves.

625
00:40:17,692 --> 00:40:21,590
So in fact, remembering people's names and things about them

626
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,254
helps you to build better business and personal relationships. If you meet

627
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,326
someone at an event and the next time you see them, you can say hey,

628
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:32,166
John, how are you? How's your wife Nancy? How was your last round of golf?

629
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:35,834
Automatically what they're feeling is, wow,

630
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:39,834
they must be pretty important to you if you can remember those things.

631
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:43,214
About the most important is their name. And then in turn they

632
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:46,814
become much more interested in getting to know you and what

633
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:51,146
you're about better. This is really very strengthening

634
00:40:51,258 --> 00:40:54,978
to relationships. Now, on the opposite side,

635
00:40:55,144 --> 00:40:58,686
if you are not remembering people's names, or maybe even worse,

636
00:40:58,798 --> 00:41:02,402
you're calling people by the wrong name, this can be very

637
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:06,018
detrimental to both business and

638
00:41:06,184 --> 00:41:09,878
personal relationships. I had a guy come up to me

639
00:41:09,964 --> 00:41:14,038
after one of my presentations and he told me he was in sales and

640
00:41:14,124 --> 00:41:17,970
he actually ended up getting fired because he attended

641
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,478
an annual or semiannual conference

642
00:41:21,574 --> 00:41:24,826
and he had accidentally the whole day been calling the

643
00:41:24,848 --> 00:41:28,394
vice president of sales by the wrong name. I think he called him by

644
00:41:28,432 --> 00:41:32,334
a similar name, like it was close to the correct name,

645
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:35,486
but not exactly right. And the

646
00:41:35,508 --> 00:41:39,470
vice president ended up training to a supervisor and said, look, in a sales

647
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,246
career, this is just not acceptable in

648
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:47,150
our field. We really need to be good with names. And the guy got fired.

649
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,978
That's maybe, perhaps an extreme example, but I think we all know

650
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:54,242
that people that are very good with

651
00:41:54,296 --> 00:41:57,742
names are more popular, more likable.

652
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:02,246
Politicians are clear on this fact. By the way, a lot of politicians go through

653
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:05,478
memory skills training. They really want to make it a point to get good at

654
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:09,286
names. And I think we all realize that it can be detrimental to

655
00:42:09,308 --> 00:42:12,554
relationships when you are not remembering names or calling people by

656
00:42:12,592 --> 00:42:15,514
the wrong name. So let me give you some steps that you can put into

657
00:42:15,552 --> 00:42:18,954
practice right away. All right, step number one, to help

658
00:42:18,992 --> 00:42:22,666
you out with names from this day forward, whenever you are introduced

659
00:42:22,698 --> 00:42:26,414
to someone, make it a point to immediately repeat the name and shake their

660
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:30,074
hand if you can. Or maybe if we're concerned

661
00:42:30,122 --> 00:42:33,662
about germs, you can do that elbow bump with a

662
00:42:33,716 --> 00:42:36,718
pandemic that we have going on recently,

663
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:40,558
but definitely at least repeat the name. Nice to meet you, John, or pleased

664
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:43,778
to meet you, John. It might seem pretty obvious there,

665
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:47,800
but a lot of times when someone is telling us their name, introducing themselves,

666
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:52,150
our mind is all over the place. We're thinking about all sorts of other things.

667
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,006
We don't even pay attention to the name for even 1 second.

668
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:59,362
So that first step forces us to pay attention

669
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:02,806
for at least a second. That's the only way we could repeat

670
00:43:02,838 --> 00:43:05,578
the name right back to the person. Start doing that today.

671
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:09,274
Eventually it's going to become a habit and second nature to you.

672
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:12,702
Step number two, early on in your interaction with

673
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,206
the person, ask them a simple question using their name.

674
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:19,662
So, John, how do you know Chester or John? How long have you been

675
00:43:19,716 --> 00:43:23,390
involved with this organization? Just one question

676
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,330
early on will reinforce the name in your mind.

677
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,818
Prevent it from just going in one ear and out the other. I want to

678
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:34,562
clarify. I don't mean use the name over and over again

679
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,986
in the conversation to where it starts to seem a little weird. Just use it

680
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:41,782
once early on. That will be enough to reinforce it. Step number three,

681
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:45,398
take a few seconds or less to think of a connection between

682
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:49,350
the name, the person's name, and anything at all that you already know. So John

683
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,922
might make you think of John Lennon. It could be a famous person

684
00:43:52,976 --> 00:43:56,186
like that, or it could be a character from a tv show or movie that

685
00:43:56,208 --> 00:44:00,202
you like. It could be something as simple as you have a friend

686
00:44:00,256 --> 00:44:04,046
or family member that has that same name. Thinking of a

687
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:07,806
connection between the name and literally anything at

688
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:11,306
all that you already know is really going to help that name to stick

689
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:15,374
better in your long term memory. Step number four. Whenever you leave

690
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:19,074
the party, the meeting, whatever type of function it might be, make it a point

691
00:44:19,112 --> 00:44:22,674
to try to say goodbye to people actually using their

692
00:44:22,712 --> 00:44:26,774
name. That's really going to go a long way toward helping you

693
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:30,038
to remember more of those names long

694
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:33,302
term. Those four steps are

695
00:44:33,356 --> 00:44:37,266
going to help you out right away. You will notice an immediate improvement

696
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:41,414
if you combine them with the visual based technique

697
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:45,226
that I very briefly hit on earlier. There is no doubt in

698
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:49,258
my mind that you will be better than you ever have before

699
00:44:49,344 --> 00:44:52,746
remembering names. You might not be 100%. Even I'm not

700
00:44:52,768 --> 00:44:55,838
100%. But if you can remember 80 plus percent of

701
00:44:55,844 --> 00:44:59,054
the people that you're meeting, this is going to pay off big time in your

702
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:02,414
career. This is going to help you out in your personal life as well.

703
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:06,030
You're going to find just that this helps you to be more likable

704
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,358
to people. This definitely strengthens relationships.

705
00:45:09,454 --> 00:45:13,166
The visual again that I had mentioned was like a microphone.

706
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:16,370
You might picture for the name Mike.

707
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,626
There's another step to that. When you come up with the visual

708
00:45:20,658 --> 00:45:24,002
for the name, also connect it to something about the person's

709
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:27,106
look. So if you're meeting this new person named Mike,

710
00:45:27,218 --> 00:45:31,290
ask yourself what's unique about the look. Maybe to you he's got cool

711
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,554
looking hair. If that's the case, you might imagine the

712
00:45:34,592 --> 00:45:38,154
microphone getting tangled up in his hair. Because how

713
00:45:38,192 --> 00:45:41,934
this works is the next time you see the person, all you have to

714
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:45,406
do is ask yourself what was noticeable to

715
00:45:45,428 --> 00:45:49,294
me about their look. You're very likely to notice what was

716
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:52,506
unique to you before. The image that you then stored

717
00:45:52,538 --> 00:45:56,174
there will immediately come back to you. You'll see the mic, the microphone

718
00:45:56,222 --> 00:45:59,966
that will remind you that the name was Mike. It might seem a little strange,

719
00:46:00,078 --> 00:46:03,602
but it's very powerful and effective. Anyone can get

720
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:07,442
good at doing this with a little bit of training and practice.

721
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:11,094
If you want some more training and practice with that and to

722
00:46:11,132 --> 00:46:15,186
learn more techniques, check out my online memory

723
00:46:15,218 --> 00:46:18,230
school. So in my online memory school, it's memoryschool.

724
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,130
Net is the URL. I would picture a gigantic

725
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:26,518
maybe fishing net to remember that it's net is the ending of the URL.

726
00:46:26,614 --> 00:46:30,698
I would simulate introducing you to many people

727
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:34,986
over and over and teach you a wide variety of visual based techniques

728
00:46:35,018 --> 00:46:38,942
that I wasn't able to cover. On today's webinar. You'll really develop

729
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:43,290
that skill in remembering names. I'm going to teach you how to remember presentations

730
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,106
without notes or minimize the amount of notes. I'm going to teach you how to

731
00:46:47,128 --> 00:46:50,958
remember foreign language vocabulary presentations,

732
00:46:51,054 --> 00:46:54,718
exam material for the kids in school, or training material for

733
00:46:54,824 --> 00:46:58,662
professionals. More techniques to improve your memory in general.

734
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:02,646
We're going to tackle remembering information with numbers, facts that

735
00:47:02,668 --> 00:47:06,280
contain figures, formulas, and so forth and so on.

736
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,074
That is only the core training. Then there's an

737
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:13,642
advanced training program. There's ongoing training every

738
00:47:13,696 --> 00:47:17,306
single month. New videos are uploaded every month so that you

739
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:20,346
will continue developing your memory skills

740
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:23,246
through memoryschool. Net.

741
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:26,750
There's a small enrollment fee of $200,

742
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,214
and then you can continue on as long as you want. At only $40

743
00:47:31,332 --> 00:47:35,074
per month, you can cancel at any time. I do want

744
00:47:35,112 --> 00:47:39,502
to help people out that are watching this webinar that are very motivated

745
00:47:39,646 --> 00:47:43,634
to get started, and the only thing that might be preventing you is the

746
00:47:43,672 --> 00:47:47,126
upfront enrollment. So what I've done as a

747
00:47:47,148 --> 00:47:51,042
special opportunity for people attending the Acupon

748
00:47:51,106 --> 00:47:56,262
code dreams for 100 uses@memoryschool.net.

749
00:47:56,396 --> 00:48:00,250
If you are one of the first 100 people to use code

750
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,546
dreams at the checkout screen, you will see the

751
00:48:03,568 --> 00:48:07,402
enrollment fee go from $200 all the way down

752
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:11,866
to $0. Yes, I am completely training

753
00:48:11,898 --> 00:48:15,694
the enrollment fee for the first 100 people to

754
00:48:15,732 --> 00:48:19,600
use code dreams@memoryschool.net.

755
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,590
Chester Santos here with a quick summary

756
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:28,910
of the webinar for you. The three main principles

757
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,850
again to keep in mind for developing a powerful memory are

758
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,126
number one, turn whatever you want to remember into

759
00:48:37,308 --> 00:48:40,930
visuals. Number two, try to involve

760
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,440
additional senses as you can from there.

761
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:48,426
Three, while you are seeing and experiencing all

762
00:48:48,448 --> 00:48:51,302
of this in your mind. Try to make it unusual,

763
00:48:51,446 --> 00:48:55,670
extraordinary in some way to take advantage of the psychological

764
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:59,002
aspect to human memory. A quick

765
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:03,082
review of the steps to keep in mind for remembering names. Step number

766
00:49:03,136 --> 00:49:06,458
one when you are introduced to someone, repeat the name

767
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,442
immediately. Step number two, ask the person a

768
00:49:10,496 --> 00:49:14,702
question using their name early on in the interaction.

769
00:49:14,846 --> 00:49:18,674
Step number three, try to think of a connection between the

770
00:49:18,712 --> 00:49:22,642
name and anything at all that you already know. Step number

771
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:26,386
four use the name one last time

772
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:30,050
before you leave, whatever type of event

773
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,842
you may be at and for further training

774
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:35,360
