I am excited to share with you the importance of empowering sectors readiness with quantum solutions. Today, we are here to talk about quantum computing and how it can shape these future of sectors across industries. Let's begin our journey into quantum computing readiness with an overview of our agenda. In this presentation, we'll cover five topics. We'll provide an overview of why quantum computing is gaining significant attention in various sectors. We will discuss why sectors need to be prepared for quantum computing and the potential impact on their future success. We will also explore the advantages that quantum readness brings. We will dive into practical strategies that sectors can take to prepare themselves for the quantum era. Last thing we will share our recommendation for quantum industry that leads to quantum computing readiness. So let's get started on this exciting journey together. Quantum computing offers incredible power to solve complex problems that are impossible for classical computers to solve. Today, it's crucial for sectors to preparing for the opportunities that quantum computing brings. Understanding the risks and benefits will make sectors take a step forward associated with these technologies. To achieve success, it's essential for sectors to be proactive and preparing if they want to stay ahead in their fields. So, how to be safe? Consultation services provide knowledge, tools and guidance to become quantum ready. Now, let's delve into the need for quantum computing readiness. There are list of reasons why sectors must prepare and I will just mention some of them. First one, quantum computing can disrupt industry and markets. It has the power quantum computing solution. It has these power to transform the way we operate today. Offering new computing capabilities being preparing ensure we can or sectors can leverage these advancements efficiently. Empowering proactiving preparing a proactive preparation is crucial to avoid falling behind. By staying ahead of the curve, we can maintain our competitive edge and size opportunities that arise from quantum technology. Specialized experts and consultants provide guidance. Accessing the knowledge and experts of professionals in the field is invaluable. They can guide sectors through these complexities of quantum computing and its applications to solve complex problems, understanding quantum technology and its application is essential. Sectors must develop a foundational understanding of quantum computing concepts and their potential applications. This knowledge enables sectors to make informed decisions and identify areas where quantum solution can have the greatest impact in their industry. So what are the benefits of quantum computing readiness? Quantum computing readiness offer numerous advantages that can greatly benefit sectors in various ways. First, enhance competitiveness by enabling informed decisions, cost reductions and the exploration of innovation applications. This empower sectors to gain a competitive edge in the market. Second, quantum readiness ensure improved sectors through these implementations of robust framework, risks assessments and governance solutions. These measures protect data from potential risk posed by quantum computing and ensure complaints with security regulations. Last reason quantum readiness facilities structures data by computing it for quantum algorithms. This enable accelerate processing, empowering hidden insights and enhance efficiency in handling big data. It open up new possibilities for sectors to drive meaningful value for their data. Now that we understand these benefit, let's explore how sectors can achieve quantum readiness. The first method is to establish dedicated quantum computing office within the sectors. This in house team will be responsible for developing tailored strategies, ensuring confidentially and fostering collaboration within the sectors. So it's the team inside these sectors. The other method is sectors can partner with establishing quantum computing or existing quantum computing companies through contractual agreements. These allows them to access improved technologies and proven solutions that existing, accelerating their progress and assess their specific requirements. The last available method is engaging with quantum computing organizations, both national and international, so the engagement is crucial. These organizations offer valuable services and insights. Examples for that the National Quantum Coordination Office, the MQCO in the United States. The other example is the European Quantum flagship and there are several organizations in many countries focused on the advanced quantum technologies worldwide. These organizations provide guidance and support sectors to prepare for quantum risks and opportunities. Collaborating with them ensure these sectors stay up to date with the latest advancement in the field. To further accelerate quantum computing readiness, I would like to propose two recommendations that's not available today for sectors to achieve readiness, but is available to do for sectors and governments. And it's still a recommendation. First, the establishment of governmental standardization for quantum computing fields. This will create a good ecosystem by provide guidance, mitigate risks, fostering collaboration and facilitate knowledge exchange. We don't want two companies work to solve the same solution. So the governmental standards will let the organizations or the sectors or the companies exchange their knowledge to solve different problems. It ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and maximize gains. The second one I recommend the creation of an international organization called, I name it the Quantum Computing Standards organizations QCS similar to ISO BCARB SDG from the United nations. The QCs would publish standards, then provide guidance and then offer certificate to sectors who meet the requirement of these standards. By aligning with the responsible research and innovation the RRI principles, it can address challenges, anticipate potential conference and encourage sectors to develop quantum services. This will build trust, stimulate computations and drive the overall development of quantum computing. Despite the challenges improved despite the challenges involved, establishing the QCs is significant step toward effective and safe implementation of quantum computing across sectors and countries. We have reached the final slide of our presentation, let's recap the key point we have discussed today. We discussed the importance of quantum computing readiness for sectors. It gave them competitive edge and open new opportunities. Quantum computing readiness brings several benefits. It increased competitiveness by enabling informed decision, cost reduction and innovative applications. It improves security through robust frameworks and risk assessment. It also helps structure data for efficient processing and handling big data. To achieve quantum computing readiness, sectors should establish quantum computing office, contract with quantum computing companies or engage with quantum computing organization in their countries. Our recommendation includes governmental standards for quantum computing field. This foster collaboration, mitigate risk and facilitate knowledge exchange. Additionally, we proposed the establishment of QCLS quantum Computing standards organizations to publish standards, provide guidance and offers certificates to sectors. Thank you all for being here today. It has been a pleasure sharing insights on empowering sectors readness with a quantum solution. I appreciate your time and attention and I'm excited to witness the remarkable advancements that lie ahead in the world of quantum computing. Thank you once again and have a nice and great day.", "words": [], "utterances": null, "confidence": 0.9115226, "audio_duration": 866.0, "webhook_status_code": null, "webhook_auth": false, "summary": "- Today, we are here to talk about quantum computing and how it can shape these future of sectors across industries.
