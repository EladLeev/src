1
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,994
How do you make a difference in the world? The answer

2
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:52,642
is you leverage technology. Are you leveraging technology

3
00:01:52,776 --> 00:01:56,706
today? There's many types out there right now, but I'm going to look at

4
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:59,838
some of the ways you can use not just AI,

5
00:01:59,934 --> 00:02:03,506
it's a big word right now in the world, but how

6
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:07,254
to also leverage things like machine learning and start to build foundation

7
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,610
models for the company that you serve.

8
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:14,074
We're also going to look at where exactly to

9
00:02:14,112 --> 00:02:17,434
use AI and machine learning for a given company. And I can tell you

10
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,814
this, it's different for every company. I have a few

11
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:24,606
examples of the Twilight zone. That's an image here that it

12
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:28,880
shows. But we're moving very quickly from machine learning

13
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,400
algorithms to deep learning.

14
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,350
As we look at a neural network and image recognition,

15
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,494
we use deep learning and moving to foundation models.

16
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:44,274
Those models like large language models. We'll talk more about

17
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:47,734
those in a little bit. I work for a company called Viscosity, though we

18
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:51,126
do a lot of different services. I spent a

19
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:54,390
lot of time on the database, but I've also done apps,

20
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,320
much development, especially machine learning,

21
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,902
different clouds, not just Oracle, but Azure,

22
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:04,154
Google, et cetera. I work with a company that

23
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:07,626
has several oracle aces, and these are basically the

24
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,922
best of the best that are out there, and they've written many

25
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,106
books. Some of these are mine.

26
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:18,494
But whether it be tuning, whether it be on Linux, whether it be on

27
00:03:18,692 --> 00:03:21,914
hardware, whether it be on Docker, if you want to copy

28
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:27,454
these slides, you can send it to the hello@viscosityna.com.

29
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:30,366
Or you could just send it to my email as well. And there's my Twitter

30
00:03:30,398 --> 00:03:34,242
where I tweet a lot of stuff. This is from the Midwest Oracle user group

31
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:38,222
where we actually had spot the dog, Boston Dynamics.

32
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:41,560
We talked about AI, and that was a couple of years ago now.

33
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,926
But like I say, how do you do well? How do

34
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:49,114
you make a difference at the company you're at? And the answer is, remember the

35
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:53,466
acronym win? What's important now? What's important

36
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:57,082
now so that you will be able to leverage the things you need in

37
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:00,662
AI? What are the little pieces

38
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:04,862
of technology that are needed for your specific company that maybe

39
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:08,206
doesn't matter as much to others? We're going to start with the

40
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:11,290
economic potential of Gen AI, generative AI,

41
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,626
and also AI in general, economic impact of robots.

42
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:19,298
How's that going to play out over the next few years? Machine learning and

43
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:22,338
Oracle. This will give you a feel for some of the algorithms that are out

44
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,874
there and how you might use them. And we'll look at some generative

45
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:29,782
AI that's coming in. The paper that started it all with

46
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:34,066
large language models, transformers, which came chat,

47
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:37,874
GPT was based on with OpenAI, and then foundation models,

48
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:41,690
maybe where we're going and the vector database and companies

49
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,130
like Cohere as well, Bard from Google

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,100
and so on. We'll look a little bit at robots and where we're going,

51
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,258
but if we look at the economic potential of Gen AI,

52
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:57,006
currently, 25% of

53
00:04:57,028 --> 00:05:00,346
a firm's value is digital capital,

54
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:03,706
but most of them aren't using it. Are you using that?

55
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:07,298
One of the reasons people won't share their digital capital is here on

56
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:10,398
the left, can be copied perfectly, infinitely.

57
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:14,450
And this comes from a McKinsey paper that Oracle recently

58
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,678
mentioned. There's also a symbiotic relationship

59
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:22,630
between you and a robot that can help you do your job.

60
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,946
And you could see they talk about ceos or cios.

61
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:30,406
They say you have to have algorithmic business thinking. And this is

62
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:34,502
from the university. MIT could see this is their most expensive

63
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:38,774
class, but it's giving you what a robot

64
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:42,560
can do. Well. Well, they don't have that creative human touch,

65
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,334
but basically there's this physical and digital that.

66
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:50,126
If we combine those two worlds, you'll be

67
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:53,680
even better. With that augmented help

68
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,266
in Twilight Zone, they had something called the brain center at Whipples. That was an

69
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:02,946
episode where they tried to start to talk about how they're going to

70
00:06:02,968 --> 00:06:06,680
eliminate jobs, and they eventually eliminated the boss's job.

71
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,422
I think robots are much more advanced than the ones you saw

72
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:14,582
here. Amika has expressions. Spot and Atlas can do physical things

73
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:18,970
that are amazing. Sophia robot very intelligent.

74
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,714
Tesla bot coming. Elon Musk said

75
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:25,980
Tesla bot will be bigger than Tesla the car.

76
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,534
But there's definitely going to be an impact to jobs. And in certain

77
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:34,446
countries, it'll be heavier, but usually at

78
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:38,186
the lower level jobs, not to say some of the higher level jobs

79
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:41,690
won't be hit. You could see it at Amazon's warehouse,

80
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,346
where robots are constantly moving that warehouse to

81
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:48,782
make it most efficient, where robots

82
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:51,922
stack things, where robots drive cars or deliver things.

83
00:06:52,056 --> 00:06:55,002
How about leverage? Are you leveraging the database,

84
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,200
gps robotics in your company?

85
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,838
And then some people say, well, are we going

86
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:06,274
to be obsolete? And in the twilight zone,

87
00:07:06,322 --> 00:07:10,074
obsolete, man, the guy worked

88
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:13,366
at the library, was librarian. But there's a lot of jobs

89
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:17,034
that are obsolete. Pinsetters, telephone operators that used

90
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:21,390
to just plug in different phones, ice cutters.

91
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,074
Do we need those jobs, or should we leverage robotics

92
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:29,914
to help us to do better? Now, if you're

93
00:07:29,962 --> 00:07:33,326
a database administrator and I know a lot of people are here. I know we

94
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:36,978
have a lot of security talks here, which is phenomenal. I have

95
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:40,162
some great python, a great python talk,

96
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:43,406
which also has to do with machine learning. But when you look at the jobs,

97
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:47,154
they're still growing. If I look at emerging

98
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:51,094
jobs for developers and dbas work as part

99
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:55,254
of the, not the analytics team, really, the machine learning or AI team

100
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:59,638
used to be the analytics team. I always tell people analytics is

101
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:03,626
maybe when you're looking at 100,000 records or something like that,

102
00:08:03,728 --> 00:08:07,478
whereas machine learning, you're looking at billions, trillions, and you're

103
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:10,780
looking at them over and over and you're looking at them in different ways.

104
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,942
But when I look at the big data that's out there, I like the five

105
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:19,214
v's, volume, it's big. Velocity is coming

106
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:22,462
at you very fast, but the value is different.

107
00:08:22,596 --> 00:08:26,210
Very important to have somebody that understands the value

108
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,662
of those different varieties of data and also the truth,

109
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:33,154
the veracity of that data. Oracle has tried

110
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:36,282
to put it. So you could do Json, or you could do relational,

111
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:39,830
you could do graph database inside the same database,

112
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,454
or spatial for that matter. That's a little bit about

113
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:47,960
that. But what does data do? For me, it tells me something.

114
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,762
What do I need? It was a guy that would give you what you

115
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:56,346
needed in the future in this twilight zone. But what

116
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,820
does a CFO need?

117
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,840
We don't want to give them what we used to give them, which was

118
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,326
analytics. Oh, here's how your numbers were. We want

119
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:11,070
to give them something that's more predictive. Here's what your numbers

120
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,638
are going to be, or even prescriptive. Prescribe.

121
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:17,890
I'm going to prescribe to you what you need to do to hit the number

122
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,854
you need to hit. So we're moving from predictive to prescriptive

123
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:22,740
right now.

124
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,194
Also, some people think most of the job when

125
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:31,702
I get to the world of AI and machine learning is with a data

126
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:34,818
scientist, but that's 20% of the job generally.

127
00:09:34,994 --> 00:09:38,214
Most of the other part of the job is making sure I have the right

128
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:41,734
data, identifying it well, making sure it's cleansed,

129
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:45,194
making sure I don't have any bad data, making sure it's correct, make sure it

130
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:49,334
doesn't have any biases. These are going to be dbas and developers

131
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:53,306
doing those jobs. But Oracle has a database called an autonomous

132
00:09:53,338 --> 00:09:56,494
database. Is it a robot? Well,

133
00:09:56,532 --> 00:10:01,086
lux is a robot, Siri is a robot. They just don't walk around and

134
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:05,454
they work 24/7 they don't ask for a raise. But the autonomous

135
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:08,786
database, manage my database, secure a

136
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,386
system, use machine learning and AI to secure it,

137
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:16,058
to tune it, to put on a patch before I even know the patch exists

138
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:19,286
or is needed. Even Oracle unveiled this

139
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:22,210
in 18 C, and right now in their main database,

140
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,670
19 C, they have it also in their later versions.

141
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,626
But Oracle's focus isn't to be a

142
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:33,514
retail innovator. Let's say like

143
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:37,366
Amazon. They don't want to be a search or marketing

144
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:41,338
innovator like Google. They're literally about

145
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:44,554
making you the innovator. They want you to win.

146
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:48,254
They like, as Larry Allison says, I like leaders. People do

147
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:52,000
things before they become fashionable or popular. He's saying, I like

148
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,470
innovators, people that do things first, that leverage

149
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,930
and use the technology. And they put machine learning

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,654
in all kinds of things, their apps, financials,

151
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:04,420
manufacturing, and so on.

152
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,262
They've also built an autonomous database. We'll talk about that in a minute.

153
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:13,174
They also bought an open source platform called

154
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:16,946
datascience.com, where you can actually leverage those open source

155
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:20,520
algorithms. When you look at machine learning,

156
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,250
I think it's very important to start with the business problem.

157
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,058
What am I trying to solve? I have good customers. I want

158
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:31,610
to know which ones are good or bad. I want to know which ones

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,518
in big data look like my good customers. What is that business

160
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:38,926
problem I want to solve? It's not to make more money. It's to do something

161
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:42,542
specific that maybe will lead to making

162
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:45,666
more of a profit. Then I find a function. What do

163
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:48,978
I want to perform? Why I want to separate good and bad customers. Maybe I

164
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:52,318
want to classify them. Then I have several

165
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:55,140
classification algorithms I can use.

166
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,960
So what's the problem? Do I want to cluster big data

167
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,146
to see a certain age group that I know buys

168
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:07,320
my product because I want to increase my sales,

169
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,446
is the business. And then the function is clustering, then the algorithms.

170
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:15,414
One of the clustering algorithms. Or am I looking for anomalies

171
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:19,178
like fraud or things like that? So first I'm going

172
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:22,794
to train the model with 60% of my data so

173
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:26,094
it gets to know my data well. Then I'm going to use the other

174
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:29,294
40% and say, how are you doing? Are you

175
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:33,134
finding the right stuff? Are you finding the most

176
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:36,738
important things? And as I said,

177
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,794
I'm just going to give you a feel for this. I'm not going to teach

178
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:42,900
you machine learning. You can download this talk, obviously,

179
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,886
but you'll have to use it in

180
00:12:46,908 --> 00:12:49,880
the specific parts of your business that matter.

181
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,534
So a business understanding product, employees that leave no based

182
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:57,814
on past employees, maybe that voluntarily left,

183
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:59,740
maybe that we're doing a great job,

184
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,266
target the best customers. What makes my best customer? Is it

185
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:06,620
how much they buy? How profitable it is?

186
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,490
What do they buy together? They buy item a and item c.

187
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,934
Is there another customer that I should be using a chat bot to tell

188
00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:17,898
them you should be buying item c as well? Or is it clustering

189
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:21,406
of data or something else with Oracle? And I won't go

190
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:24,986
into too much coding here, but all it takes is, you know,

191
00:13:25,028 --> 00:13:28,674
what am I trying to do, trying to find out what

192
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:32,562
are the attributes attribute importance of

193
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:36,420
certain customers that get them to want to buy insurance.

194
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,166
And if you know SQl, you could see I look at

195
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:43,558
a table and I want to do it by customer id and whether they're going

196
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,690
to buy insurance or not and what are the attributes,

197
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,450
then the output is going to tell me what really matters

198
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,620
as to whether they're going to buy insurance or not.

199
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:58,538
Then I'm going to classify that data.

200
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,586
I'm going to say now that I know the attributes when a person walks

201
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:07,006
in the door. Now I want to know if they're going to buy insurance based

202
00:14:07,108 --> 00:14:10,750
on those attributes that I know

203
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,302
are the most important attributes. And then I can predict that.

204
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,970
Or I can have a salesperson call different people to see

205
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,966
which ones are likely to buy it. I'm not looking to teach you SQL

206
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:25,714
or show you that. I'm just trying to show you it's not difficult to

207
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:29,746
make a very large impact. This would already make a large impact

208
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:33,126
in your company. Now these are some of the algorithms that are

209
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:36,646
out there. I'm not going to dwell on these. These are

210
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,770
some of the Oracle algorithms names. They also have different

211
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,180
know. If I'm clustering data. Well, how many clusters is it?

212
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:49,286
And then Oracle, also very important, has a product called autonomous

213
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:53,500
database. And you can go to www.oracle.com,

214
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,406
go to cloud slash free, and you could actually

215
00:14:57,508 --> 00:15:01,440
get a free copy of this as long as you're using it.

216
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,466
You get this provision which means you've built a database

217
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:09,074
in all two minutes and then to

218
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:12,894
start it up 30 seconds. Then they give you a lot of different examples.

219
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:16,366
So again, how do I leverage these algorithms?

220
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:20,566
I could do it by getting this free version of the autonomous database and then

221
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:24,594
go and cluster some data with R if I know R or with Python

222
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:28,134
if I know Python, or with SQL if

223
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:31,466
I know SQl. So actually they give me a way to do that

224
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:34,794
in different ways. Now once

225
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:38,234
I go in there, there's something called a notebook and it's a series of

226
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:41,450
Python or SQl statements similar

227
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,242
to the SQL I showed you earlier, where I call some algorithms

228
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:49,002
to do some function. Once I know what business problem I want to solve,

229
00:15:49,066 --> 00:15:52,174
start there first, and then I can graphically use

230
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:55,002
some of the other stuff. But what do I need to know? SQl,

231
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:59,262
Python R. In this case, I'm predicting

232
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:02,754
where it's anomalous customers and why are

233
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:06,214
they anomalous, what are the attributes? So once I

234
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:10,550
found that they're anomalous, what are the attributes making them anomalous?

235
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,466
I look at machine learning, and it's a lot like the twilight

236
00:16:16,498 --> 00:16:20,230
zone, where it's a game of pole, and the guy says, you want to be

237
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,866
the best at something, you've got to have talent. You've got

238
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:26,938
to have a little bit of luck. Got to be at the right place at

239
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,058
the right time. Oh, you're watching this video. You're at the right place at the

240
00:16:30,064 --> 00:16:33,180
right time. At a time when machine learning and AI is coming.

241
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,022
You got to work. You got to actually build stuff. You got to

242
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:40,270
leverage your knowledge, but also add to it,

243
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,622
and you got to have nerves. You got to be able to go to somebody

244
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:45,986
and say, I can make a business decision. I can

245
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:49,394
make a business impact if you'll make a decision to

246
00:16:49,432 --> 00:16:52,882
use AI. So now I just want to show you,

247
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:56,070
to give you a feel for some of what's out there. As I said,

248
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,102
what's my problem? Maybe I want to get good and bad customers.

249
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,430
Well, I could use classification algorithms.

250
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,990
So these are the algorithms in black, and classification is the function

251
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,602
I'm trying to perform. But these algorithms are not doing

252
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,642
the same thing as each other. So one of them, let's look at an example

253
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:18,602
of one decision tree algorithms. Looks at, oh,

254
00:17:18,656 --> 00:17:22,286
maybe I'm a lawyer. I take a case. Maybe I proceed. Maybe I'm

255
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,754
going to win. Maybe I'm going to lose. Maybe there's costs

256
00:17:25,802 --> 00:17:29,646
if I lose. Maybe there's benefits or damages if I

257
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:33,322
win. Then I calculate all those models

258
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,620
and say they should take the offer instead.

259
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:40,114
So what is a decision tree? A lot of different choices of data you

260
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:43,940
already know about a business to make decisions quickly.

261
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,034
One algorithms to classify whether I should take a case or

262
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:51,334
not. Here's an example. I don't know what

263
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:55,046
happened there. Sorry. Here's an example of where

264
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:58,902
I'm using a decision tree, and I want to find

265
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:03,020
out. I want to classify the data to see if somebody will buy this

266
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,220
sports logo credit card.

267
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,246
And then after I do that, I run it, and now I have the probability

268
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:14,342
and the cost of this that I could now give to my salespeople.

269
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:17,406
But it's not a lot of code. I'm not teaching you the code, but just

270
00:18:17,428 --> 00:18:20,990
showing you it's not a lot. I'm giving it a function.

271
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,870
What is it doing? I'm giving it a table, a column,

272
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,370
and will somebody actually by it or not? And first again train

273
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,746
it with 60% and then use it with big data or

274
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:35,214
something like that. Now, random forest, similar to a decision

275
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:38,806
tree, but it's like having a lot of decision trees. And I don't want

276
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:42,358
this curvy line. I want to smooth things out a

277
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:46,594
little while a decision tree, if I have six ones and three zeros,

278
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:51,114
it'll say, well, it's a one, and it keeps us from too

279
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:54,506
closely fitting things. Or do I want to do

280
00:18:54,528 --> 00:18:58,570
a neural network classifier? This is great for classifying images.

281
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,618
Let's see, I show it 1000 pictures of cats and it knows what a

282
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:05,754
can is. 1000 pictures of dogs, 1000 pictures

283
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:09,662
of people. And then I tell the autonomous car, don't hit these

284
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,534
three things. Well, you need more than three. But it also does speech

285
00:19:13,582 --> 00:19:16,962
recognition, handwriting recognition, and it's built

286
00:19:17,016 --> 00:19:20,882
based on basically math that was built maybe

287
00:19:21,016 --> 00:19:24,530
70 years ago. Some of it, some of it was even

288
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,134
in the late 18 hundreds, just to let you know. But I have this

289
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:31,686
neural network, a set of neurons, and maybe I'm looking at the

290
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:35,714
images and I find edges or I find object parts and that becomes

291
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:39,526
objects. Then through this equation, going through

292
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:45,082
these levels, I use something called backpropagation to find and

293
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:48,986
kind of tweak it. And you see a lot here. I know this slide I

294
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:52,858
could probably spend an hour on, but it simulates or

295
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:56,190
really copies the mind. I'm looking at a dog,

296
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,598
I look at different levels of different things I'm looking at. Then it

297
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:02,782
can tell me is a cat or a dog. Now, the difference with

298
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:06,434
deep learning is maybe I tell it about which features I want

299
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,066
with machine learning, whereas in deep learning it just looks at the

300
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:13,620
images and it figures out the features that are important.

301
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,694
So am I trying to classify things? Am I trying

302
00:20:18,732 --> 00:20:21,970
to classify cases? Am I trying to classify

303
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,942
images? Am I trying to classify words? Depending on what it is,

304
00:20:26,076 --> 00:20:29,766
you might choose a different algorithm. Or am I doing anomaly

305
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,660
detection? What's in this sphere and what's outside?

306
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,134
Am I looking for anomalies? Somebody built the math

307
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:41,866
maybe 50 years ago and said, this is what's inside the

308
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:45,518
circle and these are outliers. They might not be anything that's a

309
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:48,814
problem, but they're anomalies, and I might look closely at

310
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:52,506
it. There's also a linear one where it will separate

311
00:20:52,538 --> 00:20:55,602
good and bad customers as well, not by the green or blue line,

312
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:59,330
but by the red line. They also use

313
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,326
anomaly detection with very minor subtle anomalies.

314
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:06,834
Nuclear power plants use them, major airline jets.

315
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:10,706
Oracle's exadata hardware uses them to look for those subtle anomalies.

316
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:14,470
So am I looking for big anomalies, subtle anomalies,

317
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,566
and there's clustering of data after.

318
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,698
Let's call k three down below,

319
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:25,514
trying to find separate this into three equal groups by

320
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,060
distance, just to let you know.

321
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,758
I can also do that with Oracle's analytics cloud product and

322
00:21:32,784 --> 00:21:35,914
just set it to that number. But Oracle

323
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:39,006
goes one step further, says, I'm going to give you another algorithm where it

324
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:42,474
separates it by density. When it comes to voting,

325
00:21:42,522 --> 00:21:46,402
well, people are grouped together. It's not distance based where k means

326
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:50,050
is distance based o cluster density based

327
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,902
clustering. It's also time series algorithms.

328
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,826
Is this the kind of problem you have as a business or the kind

329
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,994
of opportunity while your video games are extremely

330
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:04,662
seasonal, or maybe an Airbnb is around certain events that

331
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:08,214
happen? I don't show

332
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:12,422
it, but they also have some models like exponential

333
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:15,706
smoothing and double exponential smoothing for Holt winners. So would

334
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:19,034
you think of a line of a stock that's very going up,

335
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,526
down, up, down, up down? Let's smooth that out a little

336
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:26,538
with exponential Smoothing. Another kind of time series algorithm.

337
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:30,526
It's also regression. Most people look at regression and

338
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:33,906
they go, wow, it's a straight line. There's some points. I know what's going to

339
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:37,266
happen in the future, but if the points are far from

340
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:41,186
the line, there's a big difference. The r

341
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:45,394
squared, it's called coefficient of

342
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:48,838
determination. How far are those points from the line? That matters a

343
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:52,134
lot on how good your prediction is going to be.

344
00:22:52,332 --> 00:22:56,150
It's a linear regression. But what about when the points are all over the place?

345
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,606
Well, with machine learning, I can still put lines

346
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:02,906
through that and find it. Let's say it's a sine wave or a

347
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:06,810
cosine wave. I could use some of the other ones, like support

348
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,522
vector machines. How about

349
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:14,126
attribute importance? I found my good

350
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:17,694
and bad customers. Now let me find out what attributes are making them a good

351
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:20,880
customer or a bad customer. Can I fix it?

352
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,162
Some of those that are out there, principal component analysis does

353
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:29,362
what if you think of all the things that, let's say,

354
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:33,074
make up your good customer. Oh, they're a good customer

355
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,822
because they buy very often. They're near

356
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:41,590
us, things they buy are very profitable. They buy consistently.

357
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,374
They tell other customers we're good. Then I make a matrix of

358
00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:50,058
numbers and say, this is a great customer.

359
00:23:50,144 --> 00:23:53,654
Then I compute that eigenvector, or what are the principal

360
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:57,606
components of that matrix? Maybe I have 80 different reasons

361
00:23:57,638 --> 00:24:00,922
of why this person buys something, but 20 of them really

362
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:04,894
matter a lot. Well, that makes it a lot faster if I limit it down.

363
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:08,810
But the word eigen comes from the dutch or german

364
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,902
word, which means just like my very own. So you might

365
00:24:11,956 --> 00:24:15,342
buy a car. You say, well, what I really

366
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:18,242
want is a car that's just like the one I have now.

367
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:21,602
I want my Eigen car. Well, what you really want to find

368
00:24:21,656 --> 00:24:24,986
is your Eigen customer out there with all those values.

369
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,690
Principal component analysis tells me what attributes

370
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:32,646
they are, and they're also putting these in toys. Now they know

371
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:35,826
what attributes make a good toy.

372
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:39,646
Then there's association rules. Now I found the good customer, the attributes

373
00:24:39,698 --> 00:24:43,766
that make it. What are they buying together? Can I use a chat bot

374
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:47,994
to get them to buy other things, also known as what

375
00:24:48,032 --> 00:24:51,894
you would like. Next algorithm. You bought the bread.

376
00:24:52,022 --> 00:24:55,418
Now I bet you would like the milk. Maybe it's

377
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:58,734
called the a priori algorithm. Specifically, what do they

378
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,998
buy together? Well, they buy the beer and the bread and the diapers and the

379
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:05,534
bread and the milk. Well, really it's just the bread, diapers and milk

380
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:08,766
that they buy together. Do I want those close together or far apart?

381
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,594
I guess it depends on the store. But do you have that

382
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:16,100
kind of association market basket kind of

383
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,562
algorithm or function that you want to perform? And there's feature

384
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:24,246
extraction, and this is to speed things up.

385
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:28,114
So maybe I have a matrix, but really I just need a few pieces

386
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:32,074
of each of those matrices, so I'll speed it

387
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:36,134
up. And then again, I can use principal component analysis

388
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:40,042
as well. Where I'm looking at the main components, there are very few

389
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,598
components that make up a face. So I can limit it down very quickly.

390
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:46,826
And it doesn't have to be eigen faces. It could be cats and dogs,

391
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:50,638
for that matter. But there are things happening

392
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:54,322
right now with robotics where

393
00:25:54,376 --> 00:25:57,762
people, and this is an example, etern nine is saying,

394
00:25:57,896 --> 00:26:01,362
hey, we can make you better.

395
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:04,974
We can make somebody that helps you work by augmenting

396
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,822
you. Let's give a robot that will help you, but it's based

397
00:26:08,876 --> 00:26:12,326
on maybe your attributes and things like that. So things are

398
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:15,494
going fast and you want them to look exactly like you.

399
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,060
Well, they have all the cosmetics they need.

400
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:23,066
What about SQL analytics? What I

401
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:26,246
really want to do is look at different views, whether I'm a regional

402
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:29,498
manager, ad hoc, or want to look at all sales

403
00:26:29,584 --> 00:26:32,698
or financial managers, view whoever it is falls

404
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:35,582
into a different category. So a product that does,

405
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:39,978
and Oracle does this, where they look at different aggregates

406
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:44,094
in different ways and dimensions, but they also put those

407
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:47,266
things in memory, you get to partition it so I don't have to look at

408
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:50,642
everything. So it's much faster. But at the same

409
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:53,060
time, I could put that in memory as well.

410
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,678
And they also have some statistical functions in Oracle and other products

411
00:26:58,764 --> 00:27:02,166
too. But pretty much anything you could ever think you

412
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,550
want to do, it's out there somewhere.

413
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,786
So what did I try to do with machine learning? I'm trying to

414
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:13,866
find out my problem and the more detail I can get. Maybe it's a

415
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:15,580
number problem, maybe it's words,

416
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,426
maybe it's something over time, whatever that

417
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,902
is. Then I say, what function is it? Classify good and bad

418
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:27,374
customers? Regression. See if I'm going to hit my numbers or tell

419
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,000
me what attributes I need to hit my numbers.

420
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,778
And then which algorithms out of the algorithms for a given function

421
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:37,940
do I want to use? And I'll train that model,

422
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,386
find that out who's good and bad, score it on the other 40%.

423
00:27:42,488 --> 00:27:46,070
Did it work? Maybe I got to do a different algorithm

424
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,800
and then use that algorithms against things like big data.

425
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,534
With Oracle and other products, there's also auto machine learning

426
00:27:54,732 --> 00:27:58,022
where I just say, hey, I want to try all the different

427
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,586
algorithms and classification in this case, and I want to create.

428
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:05,062
You create the notebook for me when you find the best one with the highest

429
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:08,218
accuracy, and then in

430
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:12,302
this case, it's building a python notebook for me. Something took me

431
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:15,840
days to do, Oracle took all of four minutes to do.

432
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,750
I think you get time enough at last with auto machine learning.

433
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,382
And the reason why it's important is because AI

434
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:27,938
is really driving things fast, and auto machine learning can give

435
00:28:27,944 --> 00:28:30,580
you these notebooks very quickly.

436
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,786
Oracle also has hardware that does this, whether it

437
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:38,402
be multi tenant. Maybe those are different business groups or different

438
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:41,430
customers. Even in memory database,

439
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:45,606
real application clusters, if one node goes down, the others are

440
00:28:45,628 --> 00:28:48,230
up. That's for recoverability or for availability.

441
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:52,838
Rather, can active data guard is an off site failover

442
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:54,650
where it has recoverability.

443
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:59,674
But like I say, these are some of the key

444
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:03,374
algorithms I think you should start with. Think of your business. What am I trying

445
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:07,530
to do? And is there something that can help us do it faster?

446
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,326
Number one job, AI machine learning specialist. It could be you,

447
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:15,106
maybe after this class. What are you trying to do

448
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,946
supervised learning. That means you have data, then you want to

449
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:22,526
classify it and see what is identified as fraud.

450
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:26,682
Or are you looking to build an autonomous car and you need to do image

451
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:30,102
classification to see so you don't hit things on the road?

452
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:33,926
Or is it regression to a market forecast? Or maybe

453
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:38,182
you don't have data unsupervised. Learn just cluster data and

454
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:41,580
give me customers that are similar to my best customers.

455
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,514
Oracle does this in all of their products where you don't even have

456
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:49,306
to do that. Whether it be financials, whether it be sales, whether it

457
00:29:49,328 --> 00:29:53,054
be retail. They bought a company called will it be manufacturing something

458
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:56,522
like JD Edwards or human capital

459
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,934
management where know looking at employees and what they

460
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:03,486
need to make sure I keep them. Oracle Lowe's going one

461
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:06,766
step further now. They've got, as I said, the autonomous

462
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:10,530
data warehouse. You could try it for free, but they also build

463
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,650
into it hundreds of pre built dashboards for financial

464
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,326
supply chain and these other products that are out there.

465
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:22,562
They're also putting generative AI. So generative AI

466
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:26,280
is I'm using data to generate even new data.

467
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,602
And here's a QR code that you could get to look at their vector search

468
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,786
that they're building now, but their

469
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:37,690
goal is to put it everywhere to start to use large

470
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,406
language model to generate the SQL for you. And I'm going to show you

471
00:30:41,428 --> 00:30:44,926
an example of that prompt engineer, just to let you

472
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:48,974
know, you go to Chat GPT and say show me

473
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:52,362
an elephant dancing. Well, that would be Dali images.

474
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:56,178
But if you said build me some SQL that

475
00:30:56,344 --> 00:31:00,194
will find my top customers given my table name is this and

476
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:03,474
I want to look by this column or sales or something

477
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:07,234
like that. So a prompt engineer new job coming will

478
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:10,934
do that for me. And then Oracle is going to build that SQL for

479
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:14,594
you. So here's an example of a prompt. The more instructions

480
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:18,006
you give in the prompt, the better your answer will be. I'm giving it

481
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:21,910
the names, I'm giving it the tables. Maybe I'll even have it create the tables.

482
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,494
And then I'm going to find out the average salary of employees

483
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:29,478
that are out there. Oracle has a product called Apex,

484
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,990
comes free with the database. I find this to be almost

485
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,606
the best product on planet Earth. I forget exactly

486
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:40,320
how many implementations are, but it's well over a million

487
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,830
different products that are out there. They have some quicksQl

488
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,802
of building a table with different values and then it shows you the create

489
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:52,594
table and create employee table that it's building based

490
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:55,166
on just this little bit of SQL.

491
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:58,950
That's helping me a lot. I could also look at the table view

492
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,518
and how these tables relate to each other. And again,

493
00:32:02,684 --> 00:32:06,022
some quick SQL here. But then I can create a page

494
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:09,980
item and say, oh, I want a chart of employees by department. It's words,

495
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,260
it's not SQL or anything else.

496
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,940
So I say, okay, create a page. The prompt is,

497
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,306
I could say, I want a chart of employees by employee and give you

498
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:25,326
some examples of what you want. And then you go next and

499
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:28,526
you start and it builds the SQL. You need to look at

500
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:31,040
these tables that you had built very quickly,

501
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,274
and now you run it and actually shows you employees

502
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,860
by department very quickly.

503
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,642
Now I want to go one step further and say, well, how about show me

504
00:32:42,696 --> 00:32:46,466
average salaries by job? It'll take

505
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:49,954
that SQl query and it'll now make it average salary

506
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:53,554
by jobs. This just shows, if you're familiar with Apex, how it's

507
00:32:53,602 --> 00:32:57,400
building that SQL for you that you used to build yourself.

508
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,498
So is it replacing me, a developer? No,

509
00:33:01,584 --> 00:33:05,066
it's augmenting me. It's making me faster. Then this

510
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:08,326
just shows me. Now I have an employee by department and I have the average

511
00:33:08,358 --> 00:33:12,160
salary by job. Took me all of a minute and I'm done.

512
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,358
Here's the one. So it's 2 million apex apps 3000 a

513
00:33:17,364 --> 00:33:20,894
day are being built. It is the number one low

514
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,820
code, no code product that's out there.

515
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,322
But they're going one step further. They want generative AI to do

516
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:33,730
this for me. The developer in English gives it to you.

517
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,382
The database retrieves what it needs, then it gives it

518
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:41,254
back to you based on the context that

519
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,440
you're looking for.

520
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:48,646
When Larry Ellison was at Cloudworld, just, I think

521
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:52,374
it was a couple of months ago, he said, hey, generative eye is going to

522
00:33:52,412 --> 00:33:55,834
change everything. He said, is it the most important thing ever?

523
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:59,594
And he said, well, you're about to find out because they've spent billions on it.

524
00:33:59,712 --> 00:34:03,582
So you're going to find out. Chat GPT is actually 3.5,

525
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:07,546
came out last year. There's also cohere,

526
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,710
and there's also bard and other things like a lot of large language models.

527
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,594
Think of the algorithms we had. Well, some of those algorithms are for

528
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:19,138
language. Well, somebody took some of those algorithms and they started

529
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,390
building a very large model, really a foundation model for language

530
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,126
so that they could then ask questions and make it basically do

531
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,886
it for chat. Oracle's doing a lot with healthcare because they

532
00:34:30,908 --> 00:34:35,746
bought a company called Cerner. It's making them improve

533
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:38,600
their products because they're using their own products.

534
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,650
Oracle is also driving first responders using

535
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,314
the future. Tesla car actually used to use the old

536
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:52,006
one. They're driving first responders using AI.

537
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:55,086
But, you know, AI is going to be big because if you look at things

538
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:58,654
like Uber, it took 70 months to

539
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:00,350
hit 100 million users.

540
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:05,122
Instagram took 30 months, still over a couple of years,

541
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:08,450
two and a half years. TikTok only took nine months,

542
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,540
but Chat GPT-2 months.

543
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:16,158
And if you look at Chat GPT 3.5 and Chat

544
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:19,462
GPT four, it also does things like

545
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:23,446
images, the more recent version. And I put

546
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:26,498
a few things in here. I don't have time to cover it all, but Chat

547
00:35:26,514 --> 00:35:29,942
GPT, how does it work? It's trying to predict the next

548
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:33,254
word. You're asking a question. It's formulating a response

549
00:35:33,302 --> 00:35:36,410
based on the entire Internet or whatever else they have.

550
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,866
But it's going to get us to artificial general intelligence. I'll show that in

551
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,942
a minute. But it's this time of what I would call

552
00:35:42,996 --> 00:35:46,814
exponential development. But also some things it

553
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:50,142
doesn't have. When you're thinking about something

554
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:53,440
and you're working, you're thinking, you don't write that down.

555
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:57,330
The other downside is they also have hallucinations,

556
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,282
100 layers of neurons, but still hallucinates means

557
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:04,674
comes up with something that doesn't make any

558
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:10,354
sense. Oh, Rich spoke in southern

559
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:13,654
Illinois, and maybe I never did, just because

560
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:17,334
I had spoken in a lot of other places. These are all the different

561
00:36:17,372 --> 00:36:20,200
large language models that are out there. There's many of them.

562
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,874
But if you go to Chat GPT and say, what's the top

563
00:36:24,912 --> 00:36:28,646
ten database? And when you sign up for it on OpenAI,

564
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:31,862
you get Chat GPT, you also get Dolly. Chat GPT

565
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:34,810
is words, dolly images.

566
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,142
There's also an API, but it gives me the top

567
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,170
database. Oracle MySQL, SQl server,

568
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:46,078
postgres, mongo. Now, if I go to Bard and

569
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:49,826
do the same thing. Oh, and I did want to show you that GPT four

570
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:53,554
arrived just in March. Chat GPT 3.5

571
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:57,314
was November 30. That was the one that changed everything. It hasn't been that

572
00:36:57,352 --> 00:37:01,094
long, but Google's bard, which they've also been working on a long

573
00:37:01,132 --> 00:37:04,594
time, gives me the same thing. Oracle MySQl, SQl serve, postgres,

574
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:07,878
manga. But then they have some different databases at

575
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:11,434
the end. And the reason why is, notice, I'm going to go back again

576
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:15,660
a second. As of my knowledge, as of September 2021,

577
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,340
Chat GPT, whereas Bard is right now.

578
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,214
So the top half of it is the same. But what started all

579
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:27,006
this is a paper called transformers. I'm going to point to

580
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:30,666
Aidan Gomez in a minute, but basically it's

581
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:33,886
a neural network, has an encoder and

582
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:37,234
a decoder. The left and the right

583
00:37:37,432 --> 00:37:41,010
use something called transformer technology. And it's looking

584
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,194
for, notice the name of the paper. Attention is all you need.

585
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:47,330
It's looking at as I get a statement,

586
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,366
what words do I pay more or less attention to? And then

587
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:54,726
it feeds them back in. And then as I'm writing an

588
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:58,226
answer, I'll even feed back in what I'm putting so it can use

589
00:37:58,268 --> 00:38:02,074
that information as well. And this talks about it

590
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:06,454
more if you download this. But GPT

591
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:10,166
stands for generative pre train transformer.

592
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:13,978
I'm training it on language so that now when you use it as a chat

593
00:38:14,154 --> 00:38:17,774
bot, it knows something based on

594
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:21,566
all of this training that I gave it. And how much do I train

595
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:26,290
it? Well, GPT 3175,000,000,000 parameters.

596
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,822
GPT-2 was only 1.5 billion.

597
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:33,090
GPT four, 1 trillion parameters.

598
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,742
People use it with things like deep fake GPT four,

599
00:38:38,876 --> 00:38:41,782
not as much information about it.

600
00:38:41,916 --> 00:38:45,640
And here's just how it looks as well.

601
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,974
But I'm going to put images and numbers now and

602
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:52,950
words so I can get answers.

603
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:57,510
Oracle, those going maybe a step more functionally

604
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:01,718
towards something you can use, and they're using a product called Cohere

605
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:05,534
to do the large language model, but they're also building and now have a

606
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:09,354
vector database. So basically I'm

607
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:13,214
taking something and I want to store it in that vector database. So I very

608
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:16,302
quickly can use a large language model to ask it questions.

609
00:39:16,436 --> 00:39:18,866
And I want to show you an example of that in a second. But they

610
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:22,338
also have vector indexes, because Oracle is very good at security,

611
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:25,758
they're good at data, they're good at indexes. They've also put that into

612
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:29,302
the vector database. But basically I take

613
00:39:29,356 --> 00:39:32,566
a document or image based on

614
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:36,918
the content, not necessarily the pixels, like I would do in

615
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:40,166
a neural network, but it's the content of the image.

616
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:43,578
It matters more. Then I could talk to

617
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:47,386
the system like Chat GPT and pose questions. But now I'm using a

618
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:50,460
vector search in the database to get that answer.

619
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:55,018
It's not going to replace experts, but let's look at an example. So vector

620
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:58,894
represents the image, represents a document or a video or something like that,

621
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:02,590
a series of numbers for those that know vectors,

622
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,198
what's the type of roof? You can think of it as the eigenvector.

623
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:10,740
This is my eigenvector of the house. I want to buy,

624
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,498
well, when it stores other houses, it says, well, these houses are

625
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:17,410
vector wise very close,

626
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,822
but this one not so close. So you're not going to want to buy these

627
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,590
two, even though maybe they're in the right location.

628
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,586
I can have an app and say, hey, I want this one, go look at

629
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:31,914
this in this other area and it will tell me which

630
00:40:31,952 --> 00:40:35,562
ones are similar. So if I wanted this house, I'd find one

631
00:40:35,616 --> 00:40:39,110
similar. Then Oracle,

632
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,590
in addition to JSON documents, graph data,

633
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,198
JSON data, relational data,

634
00:40:45,364 --> 00:40:48,442
spatial data, it also is now adding

635
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:52,110
vector data. So now I can just use SQL

636
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:56,642
and just say, give me the house based on this

637
00:40:56,696 --> 00:41:00,386
photo that I gave you, which of

638
00:41:00,408 --> 00:41:04,146
course is going to have a vector associated with it in this city at

639
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:07,634
this price in this house. Now I could search for it just like I do

640
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:11,078
other things in SQL relational database, but now I

641
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:14,434
could do it with an image in a vector wise. So Oracle's

642
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:17,510
added that vector and there's that QR code again,

643
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,720
if you want to look at that vector search.

644
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:24,486
Oracle didn't build their own large language model. They partnered

645
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:28,106
with a company called Cohere. And I said, remember that guy, his name on the

646
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:32,442
transformer paper, Aidan Gomez? Well, he started a company called Cohere

647
00:41:32,586 --> 00:41:36,510
and he worked on that paper that came from Google brain.

648
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:40,238
But basically they're turning those words into

649
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:44,090
numbers, but with semantic knowledge and attention

650
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:48,146
of which words matter and trying to find the answer. So you

651
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:51,554
don't want it to read 100 documents. I'm going to feed those into

652
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,506
this large language model and I

653
00:41:55,528 --> 00:41:59,078
can go to the vector database. But the hallucination is still a problem.

654
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:03,074
So they added something called retrieval augmented

655
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:06,390
generation. They said, you know what, you go to

656
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,294
Chat GPT and you ask questions, well, they're keeping whatever you're putting

657
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:14,806
there. We're going to give you a way for your company to store its knowledge

658
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:18,134
in a protected Oracle database where nobody gets it, including Oracle,

659
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:22,502
only you. And now I can use retrieval augmented

660
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:26,174
generation to give a better answer and it just

661
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:30,334
becomes much more accurate. And you can see it also compresses things better,

662
00:42:30,372 --> 00:42:34,494
but 96% accurate. And some of the other ones were only conf fourty two,

663
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:38,426
fifty percent accurate. So retrieval

664
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,660
augmented generation, I give it a question,

665
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,962
basically in English, goes to the vector database, finds the answer,

666
00:42:45,016 --> 00:42:48,342
builds the sql, and then gives it back to me an answer

667
00:42:48,396 --> 00:42:51,800
in English. So Oracle coming soon,

668
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,130
generative AI. But Oracle has put AI

669
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,562
in all kinds of different products they have. And if you use something called

670
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:03,402
MySQL, heatwave on things like AWS. It's also

671
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:07,050
very know where do I app

672
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,586
that? Well, maybe it's some chat bot where somebody on their

673
00:43:10,608 --> 00:43:14,250
phone says, hey, my power generator is not working. I don't know what the issue

674
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,594
is, and tells you what it is. And they give you, here's the user guide

675
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:21,246
right here. And it looks like you need this park. It looks

676
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,338
like you're missing a spark plug. Where am I going to

677
00:43:24,344 --> 00:43:27,842
get it? Can I actually do a gps? That's spatial data,

678
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,020
too. It's right here at this store.

679
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:36,014
Or you ask a question, are there hotel

680
00:43:36,062 --> 00:43:39,426
stays covered in my policy? Or maybe it's just covered

681
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:43,154
in the place you work. Well, it can automatically

682
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:46,578
go to that document that's yours. Not putting it on the Internet,

683
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:49,130
putting it only where it's secure.

684
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,406
What comes after machine learning? And now we have large language models.

685
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:57,978
Well, large language models are kind of like a foundation model

686
00:43:58,144 --> 00:44:00,380
that does some things for me.

687
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:04,314
And this is another paper 113 offers authors,

688
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:07,854
I might add, from Stanford. I would say most

689
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,230
of this paper is very good. Some of it is a little fluffy,

690
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,834
not as important to a tech guy like me anyway.

691
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:18,174
But machine learning, most AI is powered by machine

692
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:22,494
learning. Deep neural networks train on images

693
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:26,754
and things like that, maybe an autonomous car, but foundation models use transfer

694
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,342
learning. So if I had a bunch of

695
00:44:30,476 --> 00:44:33,798
algorithms and machine learning models I built,

696
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:37,686
I now could start to get those to learn from each other and build them

697
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:41,402
into one model for a given task. So somebody

698
00:44:41,456 --> 00:44:45,034
like Oracle, who also does healthcare now,

699
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:48,554
they could start to build foundation models to do all

700
00:44:48,592 --> 00:44:51,646
the different tasks and also learn from each

701
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:53,550
other from those different tasks.

702
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,526
So what's coming next? Are you leveraging technology?

703
00:44:58,628 --> 00:45:02,046
These are some of the robots maybe we grew up with, like in

704
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:06,510
Star wars, and all of a sudden they said, beware these robots

705
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:10,002
like Terminator. The real

706
00:45:10,056 --> 00:45:13,774
robots, though, today are, I think, beyond some of the science fiction

707
00:45:13,822 --> 00:45:17,462
movies. They're very

708
00:45:17,516 --> 00:45:20,920
smart, but also they look very much like a person.

709
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,870
Reminds me of mirror image in the twilight zone.

710
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,194
And here's a guy who uses his robot to go give

711
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:32,182
his lecture. He doesn't even do his lecture anymore.

712
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:35,994
There's a guy who's a weatherman, and they

713
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:39,530
bought his face to be the weatherman in many different cities.

714
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,262
So we've seen generative AI inside of that oracle product,

715
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:48,942
that low code product called Apex. But Oracle's also putting

716
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:53,778
into sensors and robots inside their

717
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:58,130
healthcare world. You could also use virtual assistant

718
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,740
with robots. And here's Oracle's virtual assistant product.

719
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,650
And you could also leverage database with virtual reality, mixed reality,

720
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,454
augmented reality. Again,

721
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:13,766
you have to look at your company. What do they need? And then they call

722
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:17,842
it extended reality. If I add virtual augmented and mixed reality

723
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:21,594
technologies together, just call it extended reality. If you ever hear that

724
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:25,210
they're building this new unified reality,

725
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,806
but I look at something like the metaverse and

726
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:34,480
I say, are people going to get lost in there?

727
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,790
Is it something where they can't tell? This was a

728
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,966
Twilight zone where the guy thought his role in

729
00:46:43,988 --> 00:46:47,746
a movie was his actual life. He got lost in the

730
00:46:47,768 --> 00:46:51,246
virtual world, so to speak, and he didn't

731
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:54,366
believe he was the person he was, and he started having a nervous breakdown.

732
00:46:54,398 --> 00:46:57,890
It's going to be this hard to distinguish which reality

733
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,366
really matters. There's a lot of

734
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:05,314
pieces to AI. The key for you is to see which pieces

735
00:47:05,362 --> 00:47:08,774
matter. You got to choose. Life is like a coin. You can

736
00:47:08,812 --> 00:47:12,026
spend it however you want, but you can only get to

737
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:15,020
spend it once. You have to know where you want to spend it.

738
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:19,206
It's also sentience issues. What about a robot thinks

739
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:23,102
they're alive? This was the Twilight zone where the

740
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:26,922
mannequin thought she was alive, but Sophia

741
00:47:26,986 --> 00:47:30,474
robot did an interview with her. She's a citizen of Saudi Arabia.

742
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:33,134
She wants to get a degree, wants to have kids.

743
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:36,890
What's alive? When is sentience

744
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,786
really going to become an mean? We're moving from using to

745
00:47:40,808 --> 00:47:44,642
wearing to implanting digital in the hive mind. There's also those

746
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:47,926
robots out there, but it's amazing what we can

747
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,862
do now. Do you want to build your own past?

748
00:47:51,916 --> 00:47:56,882
There's a guy that does videos, and then he dials

749
00:47:56,946 --> 00:48:00,802
in the time portal. I forget what it's called. And the flux capacitor

750
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:04,266
takes him to the right video, and he looks back and

751
00:48:04,288 --> 00:48:08,058
he's back in the metaverse at some event that he went to a while ago.

752
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:12,270
So you just got to set the time circuits. Time circuits activated.

753
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,098
Also, if you build this, people want magical.

754
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:20,640
Don't make it manic or toxic, whatever you do.

755
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:24,980
And watch out for all the security issues. You're going to see some great security

756
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,314
talks at this conference as well. Make sure you pay attention to those.

757
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:33,234
Oracle, though, has built in security for 50

758
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:36,734
years roughly, and right now they're in the latest

759
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:40,434
version 23 c. They're going to have a database SQL firewall

760
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:44,738
that blocks unauthorized SQL and SQL injection attacks automatically.

761
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:49,066
If I look at the hype cycle, 2018, it was all about tech kind

762
00:48:49,088 --> 00:48:53,574
of building this digital twin or smart robot

763
00:48:53,622 --> 00:48:57,178
or quantum computers were also coming. Brain computer

764
00:48:57,264 --> 00:49:00,842
interface. This new reality started showing its face.

765
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,106
But now it's, see, machine learning is already up

766
00:49:04,128 --> 00:49:07,678
the hype cycle, and down here is about 5% of

767
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:11,086
the people are using it. This is ideas people are talking about.

768
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:14,190
But notice what's coming in 2020. Generative AI,

769
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:18,978
things like chat, GPT. Why are things going so fast?

770
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:22,386
Because if I look at four bit, it's two to the fourth, two times two

771
00:49:22,408 --> 00:49:26,290
times two times 216 in memory

772
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:30,118
that I can access. Well, I go to 16, but all of a sudden I

773
00:49:30,124 --> 00:49:32,680
was at 64k.

774
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,334
Where are we jumping now? We're jumping from 32

775
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:42,546
to 60, 418 with 18 zeros, roughly exabytes,

776
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:46,346
and we're about to jump to 128. Then we're going to

777
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:50,266
jump to quantum computers that are going to make it even faster to

778
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:53,034
do it. And these are some quantum computers to show you how much faster,

779
00:49:53,082 --> 00:49:56,350
Google said the program they had built

780
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,126
47 years, something that used to take 47 years, now takes

781
00:50:00,148 --> 00:50:03,874
6 seconds, 241 times faster than

782
00:50:03,912 --> 00:50:09,106
just in 2019 2021

783
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:13,202
hype cycle. What's coming? Generative AI. Quantum machine learning.

784
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:17,154
They're putting quantum into machine learning. But as I said

785
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:20,486
earlier, we're starting to get to artificial general intelligence in

786
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:24,102
some areas. A computer that is as

787
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:27,846
smart as a human across the board? Well, they're smart in a lot

788
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:31,734
of areas, but they're starting to get where they're even more

789
00:50:31,772 --> 00:50:35,654
so. And what happens when we get to artificial super intelligence

790
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:39,338
and we start really finding something

791
00:50:39,424 --> 00:50:42,560
that is smarter than the entire world?

792
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,910
I used to watch Star Trek, and I thought this was so advanced,

793
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,270
it just looked so advanced.

794
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:55,010
And I remember that quote, don't get too attached,

795
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,794
Star Trek. We've done everything that Star Trek has

796
00:50:59,832 --> 00:51:02,260
come up with in some way.

797
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:07,078
Now. We've actually not only moved to the hive mind,

798
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:11,078
but with Neuralink. Elon Musk is implanting that in

799
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:14,406
the brain, and they're asking for humans to do trials on

800
00:51:14,428 --> 00:51:17,862
this. Now. How much further? This guy,

801
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:21,126
his job is, he does tattoos,

802
00:51:21,158 --> 00:51:24,454
but think of if he did haircuts, he'd be Edward

803
00:51:24,502 --> 00:51:27,580
scissorhands today already does it.

804
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,860
So what do we look at? What's the economic potential? Huge for your company.

805
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,766
What's the impact of robots? It's huge, but especially

806
00:51:36,868 --> 00:51:40,734
the ones that assist you are going to be important how hard it is to

807
00:51:40,772 --> 00:51:44,706
learn some of the algorithms and how to apply them to business, not very hard.

808
00:51:44,888 --> 00:51:49,140
What does generative AI do? Makes it a little faster yet.

809
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,214
What started all this gen AI? Well, something called transformers

810
00:51:53,262 --> 00:51:56,470
at Google Brain, that guy went to a company called

811
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:00,294
Cohere, which now does the geni within Oracle with their

812
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:04,482
new vector database. We're moving to building foundation models

813
00:52:04,546 --> 00:52:08,130
for the companies we work at. And Black Mirror,

814
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,706
I mean, you see a lot of these things already there. I put

815
00:52:11,728 --> 00:52:15,386
in parentheses that we already have a lot of those things that are out

816
00:52:15,408 --> 00:52:19,002
there. Little dystopian though.

817
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,954
Are we moving to this where people get very angry and are frustrated

818
00:52:23,002 --> 00:52:26,510
with technology? Yeah. So AI should also

819
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:29,774
help them and assist them. But don't forget, things may

820
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:32,894
come to those who wait, but only the things left

821
00:52:32,932 --> 00:52:36,654
by those who hustle. Make sure you hustle to get it.

822
00:52:36,772 --> 00:52:40,066
I think Oracle is pretty well positioned for this just because of

823
00:52:40,088 --> 00:52:42,980
their database and their security and things like that.

824
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,234
A lot of references here. Never thought I'd have black

825
00:52:47,272 --> 00:52:51,462
Mirror as a reference, but I do. A little bit about me.

826
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:54,486
How did I get to this point? Machine learning? Well,

827
00:52:54,508 --> 00:52:58,214
I went back to school, started learning from

828
00:52:58,252 --> 00:53:01,994
MIT about machine learning. They're really quite amazing in my

829
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:05,094
opinion. But if you want a copy of the notes,

830
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:08,618
you could see there's my email. There's an email you can

831
00:53:08,624 --> 00:53:13,514
get them at. But I want to thank the people at

832
00:53:13,552 --> 00:53:17,260
this conference for giving me the chance to present.

833
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:21,366
But most of all, really at a turning

834
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:25,234
point in history. You have to decide where you

835
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:29,326
want to focus your time. But machine learning and AI,

836
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:33,122
it's not as difficult as it looks. The impact is

837
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,658
impressive. So make a difference in the world.

838
00:53:36,824 --> 00:53:40,180
God put you here at this particular time for a reason.

839
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,194
Think about what that reason is. I want to thank everybody for

840
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:46,320
coming and have a wonderful day.
