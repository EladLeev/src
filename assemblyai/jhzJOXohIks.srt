1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:00,800
You.

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,266
Hi. Welcome to my talk today. My presentation will be

3
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:30,194
a little less technical, but I hope you learn a lot from it.

4
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:34,414
I will focus today on building a better web, the role

5
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:37,570
of front end code and resource optimization.

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,942
And why am I trying to raise this subject? The answer is

7
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:44,786
simple, reducing carbon emissions.

8
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,866
So let's start with this question. Do website contribute

9
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:51,894
to global warming? Today?

10
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:55,914
The Internet and digital systems are developing very

11
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:59,194
rapidly. Digital ecology is trying to make

12
00:00:59,232 --> 00:01:03,002
the development of the Internet more sustainable and less

13
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:06,686
aggressive towards the environment. So it's not

14
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:10,042
about taking a step back, but making the Internet

15
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:13,678
a better place in practice. Everything we do online

16
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:17,882
and everything we do offline with our devices generates

17
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:20,210
some amount of carbon footprint.

18
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,050
So how does the Internet emit co2?

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,370
Let's go through the journey of the data package on the Internet.

20
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,414
This adventure of this data starts in some

21
00:01:33,452 --> 00:01:36,774
kind of data storage servers, data centers or

22
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:40,770
the cloud. Everything that comes to us from the Internet

23
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,742
and everything we send to the Internet must be stored

24
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:48,646
somewhere. No arrays. As you know, most data is stored

25
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:51,594
in the cloud. And what's the cloud?

26
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:55,466
The name suggests it's something above our heads, white and

27
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:59,214
light, and we just upload files there and

28
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,590
then we can magically access them from any device and

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,818
any place in the world. Unfortunately,

30
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:10,302
the trough is brutal, and clouds are not just shadows in the sky,

31
00:02:10,446 --> 00:02:14,578
but they are actually huge, massive data centers that needed

32
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:18,814
to be powered all the time. The cloud is storing

33
00:02:18,862 --> 00:02:21,918
more and more data, even if users don't

34
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,286
necessarily want it. So any data must

35
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:28,802
be transported from the cloud to your device. And that's

36
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:32,630
done by the communication infrastructure that also

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,646
needs to be continuously powered up. We'll take a closer

38
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:39,450
look at this stage in the next section.

39
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,090
The final step is the end devices.

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,206
Our smartphones, laptops and tablets needed to

41
00:02:48,228 --> 00:02:51,902
be powered too, not to mention

42
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:54,990
the resources that are needed to produce them.

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,122
This is also in terms of digital ecology. A study done

44
00:02:59,176 --> 00:03:02,546
by Canadian University says that the energy

45
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:06,734
used to charge smartphones has overtaken the energy used to charge

46
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:09,460
pcs and laptops in 2020.

47
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,702
The production and charging of smartphones alone is

48
00:03:13,756 --> 00:03:17,670
responsible for about 1% of all global emissions.

49
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,438
It's important to extend the use time of smartphones so they

50
00:03:22,524 --> 00:03:25,738
can produce fewer of them. But does

51
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,162
all of this have a real impact? Should we be

52
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:32,778
so concerned? The answer is yes.

53
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:36,762
The digital world has a significant impact on the climate

54
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:40,762
change. As much as 4% of all greenhouses

55
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:45,194
gases code from the ECT world the growth

56
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:49,662
of the Internet is not holding back. And on the contrary,

57
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:52,034
by 2025,

58
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,666
100 zetabytes of data will be stored in the

59
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:59,342
cloud and generating 200 billion

60
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,200
tons of co2 per year.

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,930
So what can we do about this to live more sustainable

62
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,990
digital life? Let's see some examples.

63
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,474
First thing, emails. Guess how

64
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:18,010
many of them are sent every day. In the next year

65
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,990
it will be 345,000,000,000,000

66
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,750
emails each day. Sending just one generates

67
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,550
on average like 4 grams of co2 and

68
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,066
storing one email for a year. On average

69
00:04:33,178 --> 00:04:35,840
it's 19 grams of co2.

70
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,122
And it's worth adding to this information.

71
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:42,834
That average Internet user arrives at

72
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:47,090
approximately 10,000 emails in their inbox.

73
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,954
So if you don't necessarily need to send emails,

74
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:54,902
it's worth using the other tools such as slack or

75
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:59,110
internal communication tools, or archaic text messages.

76
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,510
They are much lighter.

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,498
Spam statistics shows that almost

78
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:08,870
50% of emails in 2020 were spam.

79
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,970
Using an antispam has a positive impact on the environment.

80
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,958
It's also worth paying attention to the size of

81
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:20,606
the emails. If you want to add an attachment, it's better to compress the

82
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:24,830
files or send a link to download the file

83
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,186
by using retransfer or Google Drive,

84
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,218
anything. It's also worth thinking about

85
00:05:33,304 --> 00:05:37,234
unnecessary extras such as footer, photo, company log,

86
00:05:37,272 --> 00:05:40,642
et cetera. This all increase the size

87
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:45,282
of the email. Next thing, browsing ecological

88
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:49,462
ecosia, Lilo or ethical duckduckduckgo are

89
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:53,206
great browsers and definitely can replace the

90
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:57,020
most popular ones. You can be

91
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,486
a nontypical programmer and close your tabs.

92
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:05,798
Most open sites maintain an open

93
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:09,870
connection to the server and also generates a carbon footprint.

94
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,582
If you know the address of a page by

95
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:16,826
heart, type it directly into a browser brow

96
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:20,660
bar. This saves the energy of the search engine.

97
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,570
You also can make use of bookmarks and keywords.

98
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,660
And last thing, but also important,

99
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,840
try to delete your social media data from time to time.

100
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,874
Okay, devices. So replacing a laptop

101
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:42,582
every six years instead of standard four can

102
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:46,394
save 190

103
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,900
emissions per person.

104
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,206
You also can save some co2 by deleting

105
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:58,426
mobile apps you don't use or disabling mobile notifications.

106
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:02,202
And also you can try to disconnect from the Internet

107
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:05,760
whenever your hectic lives allows you to do so.

108
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,574
Finally, we come to the clue of the presentation. The websites.

109
00:07:10,702 --> 00:07:16,274
First fact. Did you know that every day 250,000

110
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,910
of web pages are published? And every

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,630
page, every view of this page generates on average

112
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:28,722
1.8 grams of co2, what sums

113
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:32,454
up to 216

114
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:36,550
annually. That's the same thing as driving

115
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,420
900 km by a gasoline car.

116
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,020
And that's only just for one website.

117
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,302
And question for you, do you or your

118
00:07:48,356 --> 00:07:52,574
company have a website? The better question who

119
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:57,054
doesn't? Would you like to know how much co2

120
00:07:57,092 --> 00:08:00,770
is emitted of this website? Emitted by your

121
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,900
website? I will show you how to check this.

122
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,922
The first website I would like to recommend you is

123
00:08:09,976 --> 00:08:13,190
the original website carbon calculator.

124
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,560
You only need to enter the URL of the website

125
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:21,702
and if it's okay with your website

126
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:25,834
you can get a free batch that can be added into

127
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:29,754
your project. And let's see if

128
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,946
we have some other examples. Yes we do.

129
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:37,354
The next one is green pixie. It works

130
00:08:37,472 --> 00:08:41,662
the same as original website calculator and

131
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:45,054
the last one is echocurrider. It also works the

132
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:49,162
same. And our little tradition

133
00:08:49,306 --> 00:08:52,990
on these talks and presentations

134
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,454
I always check how much carbon footprint

135
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:01,640
is generated by website that

136
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,718
describes the conference I'm talking on.

137
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:09,602
So how much carbon footprint is generated

138
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,280
by conf. Fourty two website?

139
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,530
Unfortunately it's deer than 94%

140
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,340
of web pages that's ever tested in

141
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,690
original website carbon calculator.

142
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,946
And every view of this page generates almost 4 grams

143
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:34,640
of co2. It's not great honestly. But the

144
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,670
great thing is that this web page

145
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,514
appears to be ranging on sustainable energy. In this

146
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:46,754
website you can also see how

147
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:50,318
many Co 2 grams

148
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:54,322
equivalent is produced

149
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:58,086
by a year, or how many bubbles, or how

150
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:02,194
many trees you need to plant to get rid

151
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:06,362
of this co2. Okay, from this

152
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:10,234
point, let's go further. This is

153
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:14,490
Tom Greenwood, the author of

154
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,830
Sustainable web design book which

155
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,066
describes techniques that make a website more sustainable.

156
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:26,960
I will tell you about some of them in a moment.

157
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,394
Before that, let's make a moment to talk about

158
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:36,194
how co2 is called by

159
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:40,130
a methodology presented in the Sustainable Web Design

160
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,130
foundation. It's based on the data transport

161
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,102
which is in the middle stage of the data transfer on the

162
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:52,054
Internet. The other stages are very difficult to

163
00:10:52,092 --> 00:10:55,226
estimate so we only focus on this part.

164
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:58,486
According to research conducted by SWD,

165
00:10:58,598 --> 00:11:02,460
75% of people return to the site

166
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,826
first visit means that all data must be downloaded

167
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:10,478
and returning visit means that only

168
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:15,006
2% of data is cached. So energy

169
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,422
emissions means how much co2 is produced

170
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:22,034
per 1.

171
00:11:22,152 --> 00:11:26,402
It's vary for each country and the value is

172
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:29,700
averaged by SWD. Okay,

173
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,390
we can move to the part. When I talk about really

174
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,374
specific practices on creating the websites more

175
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:43,750
sustainable. First thing is language.

176
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,660
Once the website was written from the scratch or

177
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,202
developed using platforms like WordPress or

178
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:56,750
Wix as then we don't have total

179
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,910
control over the website and they are worse to maintain

180
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,654
perfectly. If you are coding your

181
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:08,346
website. From the scratch on the graph

182
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:11,890
you can see that the best

183
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,446
language is JS. A little worse might be typescript

184
00:12:16,558 --> 00:12:20,626
which is transpiration of js and the

185
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:23,960
other languages like Python Perl are

186
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,870
not very recommended to create green websites

187
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,754
and from this point now I will assume

188
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:36,010
that we are talking about sites written in JS.

189
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,442
If you write in JS, it's already good,

190
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:44,742
but it's important to follow popular standards as use well known

191
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:49,042
frameworks such as react or angular or vue.

192
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:52,334
This way there is a greater chance that

193
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:56,234
our code will be reusable and the time spent debugging

194
00:12:56,282 --> 00:13:00,270
will be shorter. The heavy libraries

195
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,950
most of the loadash functions or jquery

196
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,970
can be replaced with Vangila JS code for

197
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,842
HTTP clients used for queries built in fetch

198
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:15,490
can meet our requirements perfectly

199
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,342
and can save up to 0.2

200
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,280
grams of co2.

201
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,914
First and foremost the number of queries rethinking

202
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,502
whether the data all the data is needed optimizing

203
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:36,214
of the data retrieved from the API server

204
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:39,422
side or frontend caching instead of

205
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:42,686
asking each time for some data, we can cache to

206
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:46,414
the data locally and do

207
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:49,520
you know what image format do you use the most?

208
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,650
The best two are SFG and web.

209
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,762
S 5G is a vector format. Web is invented by

210
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:01,130
Google in 2010 and comparing

211
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,902
web to PNG saves almost twelve times more

212
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:07,080
data in our website.

213
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,754
Honestly, if you really

214
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,258
don't need to have videos on your page, just please

215
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:20,922
don't give them. And if you really

216
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:25,030
need to, please use web. It's a twin format

217
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,120
of web saving up to 50% of space.

218
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,230
Next links will be font formats.

219
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,130
The best one is supported by all browsers,

220
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,250
the system ones. The next are local

221
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,126
fonts that are hosted on our server,

222
00:14:48,158 --> 00:14:51,878
not hosted online. And if you

223
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:55,302
want to use local fonts, please use

224
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:59,730
Wolf tool format. It's much better than ttf

225
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,650
and can save up to 70%

226
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,302
of space colors in OLED

227
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:14,042
screens. Up to 50% of energy saving is

228
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:17,530
when you have dark theme

229
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,120
and it's definitely worth having

230
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,430
the last thing hosting pew

231
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,722
defines the hosting efficiency indicator and

232
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:34,254
how much energy is used. And it's

233
00:15:34,302 --> 00:15:38,546
better to use hosts that are running

234
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:42,310
on renewable energy and have some

235
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,002
green behavior policy like planting

236
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,630
trees or green employee.

237
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,142
You can find all of them on the Green

238
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:57,126
web Foundation and some examples are Sarava

239
00:15:57,158 --> 00:16:00,326
from Finland s four hosting from Lithuania,

240
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:04,330
strata from Germany or crystal hosting from the UK.

241
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,546
The next thing is user data collection or caching.

242
00:16:09,738 --> 00:16:13,962
Most sites collect user data to target advertisements.

243
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,840
This account for a significant portion of the data transfer

244
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,242
and it's not only the co2 thing, but it's also

245
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,730
unethical. And there was an experiment.

246
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,054
The USA Today website make

247
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:34,674
a copy of themselves to meet the european

248
00:16:34,722 --> 00:16:39,382
GDPR policy and with this experiment they

249
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:43,458
make 91% lighter and faster website

250
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:47,078
without user data collection. So I think that's

251
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:50,666
a change. Okay, so why are we

252
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:54,342
do this? The first thing is of course carbon footprint

253
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:58,330
mitigation, the second electrical energy savings

254
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,920
and the third is shorter loading time.

255
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,774
But did you know that 55% of

256
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:09,218
users can be lost if a website loads longer than

257
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,250
in 3 seconds?

258
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,070
So the last thing is better SEO.

259
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,798
So our website is higher in positioning

260
00:17:18,974 --> 00:17:23,526
of the search engines. So the

261
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:27,238
last thing we can do about this

262
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:30,850
is use some linter. If you're a JS developer,

263
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,534
you probably use eclint. And good news, there is

264
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:38,234
an eclint equivalent that tells you what you can do to make

265
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:41,900
your website greener. It's open source and

266
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,300
me and my team are working on to develop the store.

267
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,350
Okay, this is our features.

268
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,118
The blue ones are

269
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,754
already ready to use in

270
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:02,190
your projects and the purple

271
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,700
one are not developed yet, but we are working on them.

272
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:10,034
And does it really work or

273
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:13,682
not? The whole sustainable

274
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:17,906
thing? And our analysis shows that after implementing

275
00:18:17,938 --> 00:18:22,022
the techniques from the SWD, you can

276
00:18:22,076 --> 00:18:25,898
reduce page size up to 88%.

277
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,222
And this is without any visible

278
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:32,550
impact from the user. And our tool eclint

279
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,860
can definitely help with this.

280
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,326
So in summary, eclint prompts something

281
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:42,894
similar to lighthouse but acts like

282
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:46,346
eclint. Instead of fixing already existing pages,

283
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,434
eclint suggests what can be changed already

284
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:54,034
while writing the code. We are

285
00:18:54,072 --> 00:18:57,154
aware that our tool is only

286
00:18:57,192 --> 00:19:01,294
a drop in the ocean of needs, but ultimately

287
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:06,150
we want just one click is enough to make our website eclint.

288
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,750
This will be easier if you help us to develop

289
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,370
the tool and share the project with your friends. If you think that

290
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,530
what are we doing makes sense, please leave us a star on GitHub.

291
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,394
These are all references I used to make

292
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:28,570
