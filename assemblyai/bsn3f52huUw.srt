00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,330
Hi everybody. My name is Jesus and I'm currently working at Globant.

2
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,330
We're a digitally native company thats helps organizations

3
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,966
revenge themselves and unleash their potential. We are

4
00:00:34,988 --> 00:00:38,470
the place where innovation, design and engineering means

5
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,274
scale. Right now I work in the data and AE studio

6
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:45,714
to develop incredible stuff with data and mature

7
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:49,222
learning. But I'm talking too much about myself.

8
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:52,026
Let's talk. But a much more interesting topic.

9
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:55,646
Artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence is all

10
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:58,974
the rage. That's a fact. And sure, this concept may

11
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,526
sometimes be hijacked by marketing teams to give a modern look to

12
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:05,874
a product. However, the reality is that we are living a

13
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:09,266
revolution in terms of this technology. And it

14
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:13,106
is not by chance that I use the word revolution, because in

15
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:16,370
general, we are talking about a new industrial revolution.

16
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,290
But what does it mean? An industrial revolution

17
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,698
is defined as a process of profound economic,

18
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:27,202
social, cultural and technological transformations.

19
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:31,850
To better understand this concept, we can go back to the first industrial revolution.

20
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,894
This revolution was caused by several reasons.

21
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:39,814
The growth of population due to a long period of peace and improved farming

22
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:43,738
techniques. New technologies such as the steam engine that allowed

23
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:47,150
mechanization, dispensation of the international market

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,354
with the appearance of the steamship, and finally the emergence of workshop

25
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,570
and factories where people began to work much more productively.

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,602
But perhaps this all seems too far away, right? After all,

27
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:02,962
the stimages engine was invented in the late seventy?

28
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:06,200
S sixty s. But let's slow down.

29
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,120
Don't all these points unfamiliar to you? For example,

30
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,162
thanks to industrialization, the world's population grew

31
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:18,386
from 1 billion to 2 billion people between the

32
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:22,170
centuries. Today we are almost 8 billion people

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,140
in the world. If that's not growing, just let me know.

34
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,374
Also, I guess that you have heard that the smartphone in your pocket

35
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:33,998
is much more powerful than all the technology in the NASA when the

36
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:37,386
man landed on the moon. Right? Now imagine applying machine

37
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:40,430
learning to all this technology. Incredible.

38
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,274
And who has never ordered something through Amazon or

39
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:47,940
even an express? It just works. No need to explain it.

40
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,726
Finally, the way we work is also changing. I don't

41
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:55,926
even have to see my colleges anymore and we can keep building amazing

42
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:59,462
things together. However, I miss coffee breaks and after

43
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:02,630
works, don't you? After all this,

44
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,194
it is clear that we're immersed in a new industrial revolution

45
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:09,706
driven by artificial intelligence. The development of

46
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:13,930
new and powerful machine learning algorithms, especially these learning ones,

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,334
has helped this technology to become part of society.

48
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:21,162
And we didn't realize chatbots or recommendation

49
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:25,214
systems are just a few examples of how machine learning is becoming an

50
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:28,880
everyday thing. But why is this happening

51
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,110
if you stop a moment and think about it. Worker productivity

52
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,502
has increased incredible thanks to technological advances

53
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:40,738
and specialization. But even today,

54
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:45,322
we still perform repetitive, mechanical and tedious tasks.

55
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:49,154
In that sense, machine learning offers a new level of depth.

56
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:53,282
Thanks to machine learning, machines can perform those repetitive jobs

57
00:03:53,346 --> 00:03:57,110
for us quickly, efficiently, and tastily,

58
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,986
far increasing productivity. But what is

59
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:04,854
our role in all of this? Because it's clear that people get stopped

60
00:04:04,902 --> 00:04:09,078
to insert inside those tasks, leaving this space to computers.

61
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:12,778
But this does not mean that jobs will be destroyed.

62
00:04:12,874 --> 00:04:16,766
Instead, they will be displaced. We won't be replaced by

63
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:20,346
a machine. We will just leave that position to start performing

64
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:23,406
new tasks that best match our skills.

65
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:27,566
Sound interesting, right? So let's see what those skills

66
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:31,634
are. And when algorithm will we never be able to replace us

67
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:35,822
first? Curiosity. We are naturally curious.

68
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,686
Children learn to ask questions without anyone teaching them.

69
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:43,734
A machine learning algorithm, on the other hand, only knows how to do one

70
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:47,474
thing, maybe a handful of them, and it does it very

71
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:51,354
well, better than anyone else. But it is not capable of

72
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:54,486
performing any other task efficiently.

73
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:57,258
And that is why we are so important.

74
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:00,530
Machines are great at giving answers,

75
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,870
but it is us, the people, who will ask them the right

76
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,534
questions. Creativity is also a very

77
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:11,002
human skill, because human needs to communicate

78
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:14,206
and express what we think and feel. Also,

79
00:05:14,308 --> 00:05:17,490
we're able to ask questions and use the tools that we have

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,154
to solve those problems. Machine learning is just

81
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:25,122
one more tool, and it can be the solution to a very specific problem.

82
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,646
But not all of them. We choose how and when to

83
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:32,610
use it. Finally, humans are curious and creative

84
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,646
because inside us there are feelings that move us to investigate and

85
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:40,186
express ourselves. And those feelings can only be understood by

86
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,654
another human. Perhaps a computer vision

87
00:05:43,702 --> 00:05:47,626
application may be able to distinguish what emotion you

88
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:51,702
are feeling through your facial expression, right? But no matter how sophisticated

89
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:55,722
the system is, every time you call to your bank to make a transaction

90
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:58,926
or to the hospital to make an appointment, you expect to hear

91
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:02,062
that person's voice on the other end. And if not,

92
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,650
you will say, whoa, that's a robot again.

93
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,738
And you're not alone. It happens to everyone.

94
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:12,942
Only people understand other people and are able to communicate

95
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,546
trust. Lisa Messenger, CEO of Collective

96
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:19,910
Hub, once said that everything in business comes

97
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,622
down to humanizing things. And she's right.

98
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:27,366
The world is for people, and only we can adapt it to

99
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,874
our desires. Maybe a machine learning algorithm will

100
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:34,474
be able to detect a need, but only a person will know

101
00:06:34,512 --> 00:06:37,542
how to satisfy it. For these reasons,

102
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:41,158
it's a good idea to let the machines do 13 tasks.

103
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:44,400
Because while the tickets or the boring part,

104
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,490
which they do so well. We can use our time and effort

105
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,270
for those skills that make us unique and.

106
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,486
Okay, thats sounds good, right?

107
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,914
But it's still a long way off, isn't it?

108
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:02,834
Sorry, but let me tell you that. Not so much. Today we

109
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:07,250
have very sophisticated machine learning tools capable of doing incredible

110
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,174
things. Let me present you a couple of them. Let's start

111
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:15,574
with code generators. If you're watching this talk, you've probably

112
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:19,642
heard of GitHub copilot. If not, stay tuned because you're going to

113
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:23,094
love it. GitHub Copilot is a tool capable

114
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:26,250
of generating code for an input. Still not clear.

115
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,530
Imagine implementing a method or a data

116
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,422
structure through a simple comment in your code. Just write

117
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:37,134
how you want it to work and that's it. It's a bit

118
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:40,494
dicing, right? It almost seems that it could

119
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:44,222
replace a programmer. But don't start looking for another

120
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:47,826
job yet. A code generator is just a tool and

121
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:51,406
needs a programming to work. It's like a hammer needs an arm

122
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:55,366
to hit. Can you remember that only one

123
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:58,454
person understand another? Imagine that customer who

124
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:01,846
doesn't even know what he wants trying to explain it to a computer.

125
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:06,150
Impossible. Programmers. Our job is safe

126
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,986
from this point of view. The birth of these kind of tools

127
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:13,514
is amazing for us. As long as we master them, we will

128
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:17,270
save an incredible amount of time. We will be able to implement

129
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,646
complex applications in a much more agile way.

130
00:08:20,768 --> 00:08:24,526
And not only that, people with little experience will be able

131
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:28,106
to approach more easily and study more complex concepts

132
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:32,774
without having to spend so much time implementing them simultaneously.

133
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:36,802
This is benefiting programmers with deep knowledge and facilitating the interest

134
00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:39,460
of new students in this field.

135
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:43,934
Machine learning, but of job, not just for programmers.

136
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:47,630
Have you ever used Photoshop or after effects?

137
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,346
If you have, I'm sure you agree with me that editing an image

138
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:54,674
or a video is not can easy task, not to mention audio.

139
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:58,860
However, I know a couple of artificial intelligence who don't think so.

140
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,158
For example, deleting elements in a video, including the watermark,

141
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,334
or stabilizing the image, or even adding more frames,

142
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:11,274
are just one sum of the things that algorithms trying

143
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:14,320
to understand the optical flow of a video can do.

144
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,878
On the other hand, images work in a very similar

145
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:22,720
way. They can even be put into motions into machine learning.

146
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:27,106
Once again, artificial intelligence make it possible for an

147
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:30,914
audience, without solving editing skills, to be able to generate content

148
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:34,194
of increasing high quality. And in turn,

149
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:37,974
it makes it possible for professionals to perform this

150
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:41,510
task faster and easier. And not only that,

151
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,254
it also offers new possibilities such as restoring all

152
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:48,854
photographs and making them look like they were taken by a modern camera or

153
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:52,138
a mobile phone. Or even isolating an instrument in a

154
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:56,314
zone that you can study. The notes thats display this open

155
00:09:56,352 --> 00:10:00,074
up the possibilities for the birth of new businesses thats we

156
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:04,094
will soon see as a commonplace. However, there is something

157
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:08,046
even more impressive. Thanks to machine learning, in addition to

158
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:12,174
modifying multimedia files, it is also possible

159
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:16,370
to generate them. And that's incredible.

160
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,462
Let me show you. One of my favorite

161
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:23,886
examples is Dali. An artificial intelligence capable

162
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:27,678
of generating images just through description.

163
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:31,734
For example, an astronaut playing basketball with cats in a

164
00:10:31,772 --> 00:10:34,870
space in a minimal style. And here it is.

165
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,362
Or if you prefer, teddy bears, working on

166
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,226
aa research on the moon in the 80s.

167
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:44,874
Granted, it's incredible. That's simply awesome.

168
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:48,294
But wait a minute. These images

169
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:52,362
does not exist. They are part of the imagination

170
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:56,014
of an artificial intelligence. Does thats mean that they are

171
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,986
creative? On this topic,

172
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:03,638
there is much debate. Especially because if so, that will mean that machines

173
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:07,554
come to possess one of the qualities thats we have said

174
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:10,130
that are part of us, of the humans.

175
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,974
But in any case, the key here is that the algorithm

176
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:18,870
needs an input to work. It needs a creative person behind it,

177
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,842
a person who thinks those crazy images.

178
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:25,474
And the only thing thats it does is to generate a series

179
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:29,450
of images based on others that it already knows.

180
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,314
This kind of technology will revolutionate the world of design,

181
00:11:34,512 --> 00:11:37,850
but designers will not disappear. After all,

182
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,794
anyone is capable of asking for a bowl of soup.

183
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:44,686
That is a portal to another dimension, right? But only someone

184
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,538
who knows basket style can make the algorithm generate

185
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:52,254
this picture. So, as we have

186
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:56,114
seen, the future is for us to start working side by side

187
00:11:56,232 --> 00:12:00,050
with artificial intelligence, eventually making it one

188
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,486
of our everyday tools. And that's

189
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:07,000
simply exciting. That's incredible, isn't it?

190
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,934
So all this brings us to a

191
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:15,394
new concept, the augmented intelligence. Augmented intelligence

192
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:19,106
is nothing more than the use of artificial intelligence to augment

193
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:22,598
your own capabilities. Okay, wait,

194
00:12:22,764 --> 00:12:26,214
let's stop a moment. They may sound a bit like science fiction,

195
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:29,386
right? But let me give you an example. Remember when you

196
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:33,198
used to add with your fingers, for example, one plus

197
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:37,018
two, three. Oh, that's perfect. That was a safe method

198
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:40,398
with a very little margin of error, but it was also

199
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:43,150
tremendously slow and efficient.

200
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,778
Remember now, the first time that you use a

201
00:12:47,784 --> 00:12:50,994
calculator, it took you longer to

202
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:54,590
type in all the numbers than to find the result of preparation.

203
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,790
The use of artificial intelligence will be exactly the same.

204
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,746
Right. Now, when we think about machine learning, we imagine an expert mathematician

205
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:07,266
typing like those codes right. And there is such a profile,

206
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:11,542
and it's very, very necessary. However, those algorithms will eventually

207
00:13:11,606 --> 00:13:15,226
be packed, polished, and make available to anyone

208
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,146
who wants to use them. And you won't even need

209
00:13:19,168 --> 00:13:22,794
to know all thats complicated mathematics behind it

210
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:25,998
for you. It will be as simple as learning how to use a

211
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:29,482
new tool, just like when you learn how to use a calculator.

212
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:34,394
And that's the key. Artificial intelligence will become so commonplace

213
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,160
that almost anyone will use it in their job.

214
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,234
The challenge will be to understand how these machine

215
00:13:42,282 --> 00:13:45,430
learning algorithms think and how we must

216
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,886
communicate with them to get the results that we are

217
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:52,534
looking for. And thats skill, along with the other

218
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:56,214
three d web that we have discussed, will distinguish us as

219
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,446
the professional of the futures. But this

220
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,854
is a topic for another talk. Thank you for

221
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:06,454
joining. Thank you for being here. And I hope that it

222
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:07,206
was great for.
