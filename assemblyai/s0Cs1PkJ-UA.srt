00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,658
I hope you're having a great conference. My name is quintessence and I'm

8
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:23,602
theyre to talk to you about effective incident response.

9
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:26,674
Jumping right in. And before we talk about incident response,

10
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:30,554
let's standardize on the definition of an incident. An incident is any

11
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:34,390
unplanned disruption or event that requires immediate attention

12
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,134
or action. This encapsulates different types of incidents.

13
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,410
They can be internal, facing security breaches, data loss,

14
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,782
et cetera. Your definition may differ

15
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:48,378
from ours, and this is how we define incidents at pagerduty.

16
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:52,222
But as long as it's standardized in your organization, that's fine.

17
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:56,542
The main goal of incidents response is to replace chaos

18
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:59,954
with calm, because during an incident, people might be talking all

19
00:01:59,992 --> 00:02:03,794
over each other or not knowing who to reach out to, basically trying

20
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,006
to get that incident resolved, and then there's a bunch of chaos to get that

21
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:10,246
accomplished. And that chaos is not good

22
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:13,378
for an incident. It's going to increase your frustration,

23
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:17,206
confusion, and it's going to make it slower for you to get to

24
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,694
that resolution. The goal of incident response,

25
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:24,266
therefore, is not only about resolving that incident, but doing it in

26
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:28,026
an organized way. So you're trying to reduce how

27
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:31,514
much confusion there is around the response process itself and put as much

28
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,080
energy as possible into the actual problem.

29
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,106
Saying it another way. The goal of incident response is to handle

30
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:41,562
the situation in a way that limits damage and reduces

31
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:45,606
recovery time and costs. Because even with disorganized

32
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,682
response, you'll likely still find a solution, but it'll take longer.

33
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:53,534
The incident might get more severe over time. There might be more data loss

34
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:57,366
if that's the situation, or there might be a longer outage if that's the situation,

35
00:02:57,548 --> 00:03:01,234
and there's just more damage overall, more difficulty as the incident

36
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:05,046
continues to escalate. Right? So in order to accomplish the

37
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,802
goal of effective incidents response or calm incidents

38
00:03:08,866 --> 00:03:12,358
responses, you want to make sure you're mobilizing the correct people. This is

39
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:16,282
the right responders, knowing who to paying for a specific service or whatever

40
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:19,418
the situation is. They need to have that right skill set, and they need to

41
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,986
have enough autonomy to take action on whatever's happening.

42
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:27,198
And you also need to make sure that you're learning and improving from each situation

43
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:30,446
so you can build off of your mistakes and avoid them in the future.

44
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:34,382
Automation is also very important because if you can build automation

45
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:38,078
into your response, it's possible to start triggering the automated response

46
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:41,410
before visible incident, an impacting incident occurs.

47
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,090
Rolling back a little bit, when we're talking about incidents response,

48
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,918
we're talking a little bit about what's known as the incident command system

49
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:53,926
and who invented this. Certainly not us, right?

50
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,538
Actually, that was based on what's called ICS,

51
00:03:57,634 --> 00:04:01,654
which was developed as part of wildfire response in southern

52
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:05,466
California. In the they encountered was that thousands of

53
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:09,018
firefighters needed to respond to massive wildfires. And while each of

54
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,574
them individually knew how to handle that type of fire,

55
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:16,334
they did not know how to handle it at scale across

56
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:19,806
the land, but also between each other, so they could

57
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:23,600
not effectively coordinate over the scope of the entire situation

58
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,406
after those fires happened, an agency called firescope was formed in

59
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:31,374
order to develop a model for the large scale response for a natural disaster.

60
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:34,338
And one of those was ICS, which is what we're talking about right now.

61
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:37,326
And this became more broadly used for any major incidents.

62
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,962
And in 2004, the National Incident Management system, or NIMS,

63
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:44,562
was established by FEMA and is now the standard for all emergency

64
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,400
management by public agencies in the United States.

65
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,034
So this means that ICS is used by everyone for every

66
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:54,934
response from an individual house fire to a natural disaster. And that standardization

67
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:58,326
means that everyone familiar with the process, with the response

68
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,850
procedure, is actually able to handle and put more

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,818
mental energy on that problem, on the fire or on the flooding

70
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:09,758
or whatever the situation is, rather than scrambling to try and define a process

71
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:12,800
on the fly while this natural disaster is going on.

72
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,954
This might not feel directly relevant to it incidents, but the principle is

73
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:21,586
the same. Recall how we define incidents as an unplanned disruption that

74
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:25,182
requires immediate action or attention. The idea is that this definition

75
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:28,642
and the response pattern is as similar across teams as possible.

76
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:32,166
So when they need to coordinate, they can. This is very similar to what was

77
00:05:32,188 --> 00:05:34,470
happening with ics in the fire response.

78
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,362
Building off with that a little further. When defining incidents, it's important to codify

79
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,562
what constitutes a major incident similar to an incident.

80
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:45,546
It needs to be defined in a way that can be used across teams in

81
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:49,114
your organization. You should be able to make sure that your definitions are short and

82
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:52,566
simple and prevent the stress of is this an incident or isn't?

83
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:56,014
Or if it is, is it a major one? And you want to keep

84
00:05:56,052 --> 00:06:00,026
all of that in mind when you're writing these definitions here at pageduty.

85
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:03,306
We define a major incident as any incident that requires a coordinated

86
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:06,842
response across multiple teams, depending on your needs or your organization.

87
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:09,266
You might want to have a metric or two that you tie to that in

88
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:12,846
order to differentiate a major incident from a so called regular incident.

89
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:16,242
Again, as long as it doesn't become too granular. An example

90
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:19,734
of this might be it becomes a major incident when more than x percent of

91
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:23,314
customers are impacted. Again, this is all because you can't

92
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:27,014
respond to that incident until you know what it is. So if a person or

93
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,698
team isn't in alignment with the at large either for an incidents or a

94
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:34,700
major incident, you're going to have confusion and inconsistency in that response process.

95
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,466
Four things that major incidents have in common. Timing is a

96
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:43,146
surprise, so there's little to no warning and that the time of the response

97
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:46,366
matters. You need to respond quickly, having services degraded or

98
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:49,466
down or data loss or breaches, et cetera.

99
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:53,342
The more time that that's going on, the more severe that is

100
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:57,134
possibly the more money that's being lost, et cetera. The situation is rarely

101
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,798
completely understood at the beginning. You don't normally know why there's an outage. You don't

102
00:07:00,814 --> 00:07:04,066
know to necessarily, for example, run a simple setup script or

103
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:07,958
a reset script that might be hanging out somewhere that'll just

104
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:11,302
kick off a process or reboot a cluster, right? You don't know why

105
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:14,786
this situation is happening. It also requires mobilizing

106
00:07:14,818 --> 00:07:18,802
a team of the correct responders to resolve, and that is the cross functional

107
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:22,466
coordination. So typically you can determine

108
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:26,582
the severity based on how drastically your metrics are affected. So for example,

109
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:30,398
as the traffic to your website drops, severity can increase. It might start but

110
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:33,386
off as a Sev five, that might look a little bit. Let's pick on Amazon

111
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,162
for a second. Might look like you can add something to a cart.

112
00:07:37,226 --> 00:07:39,626
You just can't see the image of it. So you can see the item,

113
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,758
you can see the cart, you can even check out of the cart. You just

114
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:44,974
can't see the image of it. So that's a type of outage. But people

115
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:49,214
are still able to accomplish what they're trying to accomplish. If it becomes more severe,

116
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:52,178
maybe between a four or maybe up to a three.

117
00:07:52,344 --> 00:07:55,806
Now, there might be interference with the checkout process or you can't

118
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:59,106
link to the details. Even though you can see the

119
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:02,214
line items, you can't actually see what you've added to compensate for not seeing

120
00:08:02,252 --> 00:08:05,942
the picture, et cetera. So as you get more severe, now you're at that sev

121
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:09,258
three and maybe responders have been pulled in up

122
00:08:09,264 --> 00:08:13,354
to this point. Once we pass this boundary here from

123
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,666
sev three to sev two, that is what we codify as

124
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:20,314
a major incident. So severity two and severity one,

125
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:24,174
in some cases, some people use like sev zero or p

126
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,386
zero, any convention is fine. Those very severe

127
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:30,030
incidents are what are called major incidents.

128
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,400
That is when you would fire off what's called the major incident response process.

129
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,194
Anyone needs to be able to trigger an incident at any time.

130
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,378
And this is because even well designed monitors can miss things. And you want

131
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:47,018
to make sure that people are empowered to trigger incidents rather than someone knows something's

132
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:50,694
wrong and they're just sitting there worrying about retribution, about what would

133
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:54,374
happen if they're wrong or other consequences, rather than just

134
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,766
setting off the incident, triggering it, having people pulled in

135
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,646
who can actually look at it, see if it's a problem, or see if they

136
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:04,166
can just close it, right. It's less risky to open the incidents and close

137
00:09:04,188 --> 00:09:06,806
it than to not open it, or to wait for something else to catch it

138
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:10,174
if it's cautable. In order for anyone to be able to trigger event,

139
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:13,134
you need to set up your tooling to make this possible. So, for example,

140
00:09:13,172 --> 00:09:16,378
if you integrate with Slack, anyone in slack can trigger the incident, and that doesn't

141
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:19,566
require them, for example, to have a specific account for a specific

142
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:23,038
tool. If you have page reading in particular, it will look a

143
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:26,306
lot like this. Someone just sends off an IC page command and it

144
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,690
pages the relevant incident commanders.

145
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,414
Once an incident is triggered, we need to switch our mode of thinking. This mentality

146
00:09:34,462 --> 00:09:38,182
shift is the differentiation between normal operations and something's wrong.

147
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:41,778
We need to switch this from what's called peacetime to wartime.

148
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,798
It's from day to day operations to defending something that's wrong.

149
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:49,282
Something that would be considered completely unacceptable during normal operations,

150
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:53,162
like deploying codes with minimal or no testing, might become

151
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:56,422
more acceptable during a major incident. Again, depending on a lot of factors

152
00:09:56,486 --> 00:09:59,718
that I'm not going to get into right here, the way you operate, your role

153
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:03,114
hierarchy, and the level of risk is what I'm talking about. All these things

154
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:06,970
will shift when you go from a so called peacetime to wartime.

155
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,574
Peacetime to wartime is something that got inherited from the fire response because

156
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:14,154
they are a paramilitary organization. So they might use the word terminology.

157
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:18,450
We don't need to do that. We can do normal or emergency okay

158
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,906
versus not okay. Really. It doesn't matter how you term them,

159
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:25,170
so long as it's clear and immediate. People don't have to figure out which

160
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,726
side theyre on. You just want to make sure that you're using a term that

161
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:32,374
the organization is okay. With. And part

162
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:35,746
of what we want to do for the differentiation is tying in those metrics.

163
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:39,350
For business impact. Metrics can be very useful and often

164
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,922
work best when they're tied to that business impact rather than something

165
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,086
very granular. So, for example, one of the metrics we monitor

166
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:49,260
here at page of duty is number of outbound notifications per second.

167
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,038
That might make sense, right? Amazon might

168
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:56,638
know, monitor orders, Netflix streams, things that

169
00:10:56,644 --> 00:11:00,062
are relevant to their business. You want to make sure that you're tracking if something

170
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:03,770
visible and impacting is happening or not, and how severely,

171
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,914
because, again, that goes back to, is this an incident or not, or is this

172
00:11:06,952 --> 00:11:08,850
a major incidents or a regular incident?

173
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,906
The mindset shift to emergency also causes the other shifts to

174
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:18,014
happen as well. But something that can happen is what's called decision paralysis.

175
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:21,158
Responding teams do need to have the ability to make decisions on their own and

176
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,118
try and reduce impact and resolve as quickly as possible. Right? Again,

177
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:27,954
going back to not wanting z and sin to escalate over time. But it's

178
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:31,422
also important for all responders to avoid decision paralysis.

179
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:34,762
This is what happens when you spend so much time debating two, maybe more,

180
00:11:34,816 --> 00:11:38,474
options that are just similar enough or not quite different enough,

181
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:41,862
and you can't quite choose one. And all the time, the incident

182
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:45,334
is still ongoing, possibly escalating. Making a wrong decision

183
00:11:45,382 --> 00:11:48,586
in this case is better than making no decision. If one was clearly

184
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:52,078
better than the other, you would know by now. So a wrong decision is at

185
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:55,186
least going to give you some information to work with, whereas no decision gets

186
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,594
you nowhere. Now, let's talk a little

187
00:11:58,632 --> 00:12:02,066
bit about the roles that happen in incident response process and

188
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,970
the incident categorization.

189
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,402
So the lifecycle of an incident or its steps are

190
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:11,634
you have triage, mobilize, resolve, and prevent. So triage

191
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:14,806
is what happens when you see the incident, whether it's triggered via slack in a

192
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:18,326
page or whether it's hit by one of your monitors. It's what happens when

193
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:21,526
you first see it, and you need to figure out how severe it is.

194
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:24,698
It's when you're going to differentiate between, am I responding to this? Is this going

195
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:28,058
to be a cross functional response? Right. And once you get

196
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,226
to that decision process, that's when you start to mobilize people. You want to make

197
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:34,566
sure the right subject matter experts are there. And then the resolution phase,

198
00:12:34,598 --> 00:12:37,818
that's the one everyone likes to focus on, right? Everyone's cranking away on whatever's

199
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:41,326
wrong and trying to get everything working again. And then the last step is the

200
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:45,066
prevention stage. Usually this incorporates, like notes, post mortems,

201
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,498
all that good stuff so we can learn and move forward. In order for

202
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:52,078
these steps to happen relatively smoothly, especially in a cross functional

203
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:55,358
response, you want to make sure you have some roles defined

204
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:59,194
and this slide is going to get a little heavy.

205
00:12:59,262 --> 00:13:02,642
Okay, so let's start with the incident commander. The incident

206
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:05,986
commander is basically running the incident. Think of them as like a captain

207
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,478
of a ship or something like this. They're guiding the ship of the

208
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:12,778
incident response process. They are the highest ranked person on the

209
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:16,582
incident response call. We actually do recommend that in the context

210
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:19,734
of the incident that they might outrank the CaO.

211
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:23,594
Don't catch anyone by surprised by this, though. Make sure you get buy in before

212
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:27,118
you make that decision. But the idea is that they're the single source of

213
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:30,846
truth during an incident and that they're able to respond and make decisions in a

214
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:34,734
responsible and effective way. Next up we have.

215
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:38,334
Sorry about that. Next up we have the scribe. The scribe is taking

216
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:42,014
notes. Depending on your tooling, you might have some timelining built in

217
00:13:42,052 --> 00:13:45,494
for what decisions are being made or what actions are being taken. We also need

218
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:48,566
the scribe to be writing down relevant context. You don't want it to be so

219
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,694
loan that they're writing a novel that no one's going to read, but you do

220
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:55,042
want to write down rebooted cluster in order to simple, quick sentences

221
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:57,842
so that when you're looking through the incident, why did I make this decision?

222
00:13:57,906 --> 00:14:01,660
What was the impact of that decision? And we can keep reading through.

223
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,766
The deputy is the support role for the incident commander. They're not a shadow,

224
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:09,274
so theyre not an observational role. Theyre expected to perform tasks during

225
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:12,818
the incident. So depending on the size of the company and the incident, the deputy

226
00:14:12,854 --> 00:14:16,122
might help with other tasks like liaisons, which I'll get to in a minute,

227
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,560
or the scribe or something like that.

228
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,498
Internal and external liaison, or internal and customer liaison are the communications

229
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:27,218
roles. So during an incident, it's not uncommon for people within

230
00:14:27,304 --> 00:14:31,090
or if it's customer facing outside of the company to want to know what's happening.

231
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,978
Right. Theyre do AWS status, Twitter, right?

232
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:38,078
Region goes down, you check their status, you check their Twitter.

233
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:41,266
You want to make sure that someone is communicating in whatever mechanisms

234
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,886
that you're using, be it social media or status pages or whatever, and you want

235
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:48,198
to make sure it's a defined role or else everyone and the layer underneath all

236
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:51,814
the subject matter experts are focusing on fixing the issue and not like keeping

237
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:55,146
time to make sure that theyre sent the last update out

238
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:58,426
in a timely fashion. So liaisons do this.

239
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:02,006
You might have one or both. Again, it depends on what's

240
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:05,674
happening with the incidents. And then there are all the subject matter experts.

241
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:08,714
These are the people that people normally associate with incident response.

242
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:11,962
Theyre are the people with the relevant expertise for whatever the latency,

243
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:15,694
outage, breach, et cetera, is. These are all the response

244
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:17,970
level roles.

245
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,654
So setting this up at scale, when you have a department wide incident,

246
00:15:22,782 --> 00:15:25,826
you want to make sure that you have an on call scheduled, a primary and

247
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:29,190
a backup. The idea here is if that page goes out and someone

248
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,738
doesn't respond in whatever SLA is defined

249
00:15:32,754 --> 00:15:35,974
for, that it needs to escalate somewhere or else it's just going to keep

250
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:39,286
paging and going to nowhere. Right. So you need

251
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:42,458
that primary and the backup. One of the things that we do when we have

252
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:46,282
a primary and a secondary on call is we inherit from the previous week.

253
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:49,734
So when you have the secondary, they were last week's primary

254
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,910
into this week's secondary, so that they have a context for any past

255
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,302
incidents that were relatively recent. You also

256
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:59,658
want to make sure that you have primary and backup for the subject matter experts.

257
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:03,578
Same reason, actually, same rotation, secondary to primary.

258
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,146
And then if there are any other roles, scribe, et cetera, as you're defining

259
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:10,354
them, you want to make sure that they're defined again. When you send out that

260
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:13,566
page, if someone's sending out a page, let's say I'm responding

261
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,846
to what seems to be a database incident and I am doing my DBA

262
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:20,946
thing, and then I realize it's exceeding scope for my area of expertise.

263
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:24,326
I don't want to look up who is front end,

264
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:28,306
who's the SRE, who's this, who's that? And find all these people individually.

265
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:31,558
I want to be able to send out a correct page to the right teams.

266
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:34,410
All these teams need to have those on call rotations,

267
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,806
or you need to have a method of paging them that's consistent, single source

268
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:42,366
of truth, and relatively easy so you dont lose time in the incident. Responding to

269
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:45,934
the incident. So let's talk about

270
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:49,358
the response itself. A typical sequence of events is

271
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:52,846
something is triggered either by monitoring or by human

272
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:56,366
that goes to a subject matter expert. Initially, they're usually the first to

273
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:59,938
respond and see what the situation is. It might be simple enough for

274
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:03,266
them to solve right away, very low level incident, maybe a set four or

275
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,890
five, and they might resolve it, or they might need to escalate

276
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,878
it. They need to escalate it. They send out a page,

277
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:13,682
it pages the command level which is again, incident command

278
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:18,338
scribe and deputy. It also will page out the liaisons

279
00:17:18,514 --> 00:17:21,562
and will page out to operations, right?

280
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:25,260
So whatever the SME levels that need to go out are,

281
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,580
depending on your. This might seem like a lot, and you might be thinking,

282
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,120
we only have 20 engineers in total.

283
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,614
We can't have this huge incidents response process. Not a problem.

284
00:17:37,732 --> 00:17:41,118
The role scale down. So you might find, for example,

285
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:44,590
you don't need two liaisons because you only need one,

286
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,158
or your comms aren't going out that frequently,

287
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,754
or you're going to be really heavily relying on your subject matter

288
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:54,418
experts. But maybe your incident commander and other roles can be rolled up in a

289
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:57,666
way that's relatively effective. I misspoke there a little

290
00:17:57,688 --> 00:18:00,710
bit though, because you really don't want the incidents commander to be rolling up into

291
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,534
other roles. That one should be rather dedicated. But you might share

292
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:08,498
a role with a scribe. You might have liaison sharing roles. So maybe a scribe

293
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:12,390
and a liaison is the same person. Or maybe depending on the subject matter

294
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,022
expert response, a scribe and an SME are a shared role.

295
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:19,894
Make sure that this is consistent in a way that makes sense. If you notice

296
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:23,134
that a pairing isn't working as you tried to scale down, don't keep using

297
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:26,880
it. Just cuz. Just separate them out in a way that makes sense for you.

298
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,610
Let's review all the different roles and responsibilities,

299
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,318
starting with the incident commander, just to provide some more context

300
00:18:35,354 --> 00:18:39,026
for what everyone's doing. Remember that we want to

301
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:42,674
replace chaos with calm. This isn't the first, it won't be the last

302
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:46,366
time I say this. The incident commander role ensures the incident response

303
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:49,310
is calm and organized because they're making the calls.

304
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,294
If you think about it this way, let's say the subject matter expert says,

305
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:56,354
I want to reboot Cassandra. Incident commander says, okay, if two subject matter experts

306
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,554
are giving differing opinions and you're in that decision paralysis

307
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:02,150
mode, the incident commander breaks the tie.

308
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,146
Okay? You have someone who's making a decision to make sure action keeps

309
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:10,026
getting taken. They're also a single source of reference.

310
00:19:10,178 --> 00:19:12,926
It's one of the most important roles as such. So even if you don't have

311
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:16,158
the deputy stride and liaisons all broken out of separate roles, and you're starting to

312
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:19,406
combine them in ways that make sense, that instant commander is the one you should

313
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:22,586
get first and the one that should be dedicated as the single source

314
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:27,666
of truth during an incident and the one in charge I

315
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:31,026
keep mentioning, decision paralysis happens a lot.

316
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,626
One of the things that we talk about at Pagerduty is having the are

317
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:38,110
there any strong objections model. The idea is you want

318
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,966
to make sure you don't have people later going, oh, I knew this wasn't going

319
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:44,182
to work. You maybe did,

320
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,922
you maybe didn't. But whatever everyone knew at the time wasn't

321
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,030
strong enough to break the tie. Right, the two way through,

322
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,698
whatever tie of the decisions that were on the table at that moment.

323
00:19:54,784 --> 00:19:57,974
So in order to gain consensus, you need to say, are there strong objections?

324
00:19:58,022 --> 00:20:01,626
Is there something that outweighs the decision we're proposing as

325
00:20:01,648 --> 00:20:03,934
opposed to other ones on the table? And if not, we're just going to pick

326
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:07,390
one, move forward and get more information, even if we fail.

327
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,726
And all of this is about making sure you're making that decision again.

328
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:15,454
Making a wrong decision in this situation is

329
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:19,266
better than making no decision. Making no decision doesn't help you move forward and

330
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:22,850
you don't learn anything. The incident is still going on, possibly getting worse.

331
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,466
Making a decision, even the wrong one, again gives information.

332
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:29,398
If it turns out to be wrong, you can learn from how it went wrong.

333
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:32,694
To make the next decision, choose between the other options, what have

334
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:36,054
you. Incident commander also

335
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:39,286
makes sure to assign tasks to a specific person. It's one

336
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:42,454
of those things where if everyone owns it, nothing gets done, and it's not malicious.

337
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:45,418
It's just they're focusing on what they're actively assigned to.

338
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:48,586
Right. And this can be happening during the incident. It can

339
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:52,326
happen after the incident. So, for example, post mortem, if no one owns

340
00:20:52,358 --> 00:20:55,882
the post mortem, to be clear, not writing the whole post mortem by theirself,

341
00:20:55,946 --> 00:20:59,626
just collecting the people and getting people to write their sections of the postmortem

342
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:03,082
is probably not going to get done because there's no one checking on the progress

343
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:06,578
of it. So the incident commander and the scope of the incident and assigning the

344
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:09,700
post mortem is assigning tasks to specific people.

345
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,020
I mentioned this before, going to talk about this now.

346
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,746
They are the highest authority within the context of the incident, no matter their

347
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:21,190
day to day role, an incidents commander is always the highest ranking person

348
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,106
on this call. And I just mentioned, no matter their role,

349
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:28,790
we actually don't always recommend, and frequently don't recommend

350
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,142
that the incident commanders are one of the subject matter experts and expertise.

351
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:36,506
You don't want the incident commander to shift role to solving the incident while

352
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,946
they're trying to, for example, answer exec questions. If execs come in on the

353
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,342
call and say, hey, can you solve this in ten minutes? Hey, what's going on?

354
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:46,446
Hey, I didn't see any comms or whatever they're asking. Right.

355
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:49,966
The incident commander's job is to shield from all of

356
00:21:49,988 --> 00:21:53,826
that. They can't be solving the incident when they do that.

357
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:57,854
So it's actually not uncommon for organizations to have non

358
00:21:57,902 --> 00:22:00,850
end roles as incident commanders.

359
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,426
I'm just going to reinforce this a little bit. We did used

360
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:11,254
to require that all of the incidents commanders be engineers. It probably makes

361
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:14,662
sense, you think of engineering with an incident response. So all the roles are

362
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:18,130
possibly engineers. But that was actually a big mistake

363
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,234
because, again, ics aren't responders in that way. They're not fixing the problem.

364
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:25,686
They don't need the deep technical knowledge. It also limited our response

365
00:22:25,718 --> 00:22:29,386
pool. And if we think about an organization maybe larger now, not so much

366
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:32,454
a problem, but when you're small and you have that thought that I mentioned earlier,

367
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:35,854
we only have 20 engineers. Why are you using up your on

368
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:40,058
call pool for a role that does not require the technical knowledge?

369
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:43,790
When you can branch it out into other teams, that might make sense, maybe products,

370
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,946
so that they have more connection with the response process that's happening.

371
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:50,658
Right. There are other roles that can be brought in from the to

372
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:54,142
do this. Handoff procedures

373
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,838
are encouraged. You want to make sure that people aren't staying

374
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:01,238
on an incident if it keeps going on and on. Hours, 12 hours.

375
00:23:01,324 --> 00:23:04,934
Right. You need to know what time frame you need to start handing things

376
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:08,306
off for. And this is for all the relevant roles. You need a handoff

377
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:11,866
procedure, and you need to know who you're handing off to when

378
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:15,306
you're going through this. You're asking for status, repeatedly deciding on

379
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:18,886
action to gain consensus, assigning tasks, and then following

380
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:22,010
up to make sure it's completed within the context of an incidents,

381
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,206
that means if I say I'm going to reboot a cluster and do

382
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:28,878
some queries or whatever I'm going to do, it's like, great. How long do you

383
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:32,798
think they'll take you? 1015 minutes, tops. The commander will check in

384
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:36,574
in 15 minutes to see what the status is, if something

385
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:39,154
changed in that time, if I need to be doing something else and just keep

386
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:42,366
updated within the lifecycle

387
00:23:42,398 --> 00:23:45,902
of the incident, it looks a little more like this. This stabilizes the resolution phase,

388
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,026
which is why it has that little separate circle there. It's just you're iterating.

389
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,840
Iterating until it's complete.

390
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:56,278
Some tips before new incident commanders introduce yourself on

391
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:59,598
the call with your name. Say you're the incident commander. So my name is contestants

392
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:03,514
and I'm the incident commander. Avoid acronyms because you don't know what

393
00:24:03,552 --> 00:24:07,162
different type teams are doing on the call. An easy example

394
00:24:07,296 --> 00:24:10,694
is, let's say I'm not on edge as an incident

395
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:14,594
commander and I start using pr, I mean press release, and they mean pull request

396
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:18,106
engineering, right? Avoid acronyms. You're having a cross

397
00:24:18,138 --> 00:24:21,454
functional response. It is very common to have collision in that space.

398
00:24:21,652 --> 00:24:25,006
Speak slowly and with purpose on the call. Kick people off

399
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:28,238
if they're being disruptive. You can change roles, you can escalate

400
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:31,806
to different roles. You can have people who are supposed to be shadowing, that aren't

401
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,466
shadowing, be asked to leave that sort of thing.

402
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:37,506
Time boss tasks. You may recall earlier when I said,

403
00:24:37,528 --> 00:24:40,518
oh, I'm going to be rebooting the cluster and running a query and it'll take

404
00:24:40,524 --> 00:24:44,294
me ten to 15 minutes. That's a time box, right? I know

405
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:47,666
if I'm the incident commander, to check in ten to 15 minutes, if I don't

406
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:50,826
know roughly how long to take, how often to check in,

407
00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:53,660
and I'll be interrupting what that person is doing.

408
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,822
You also need to be able to explicitly declare when the response has ended,

409
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:02,186
because once that has happened, you don't want people to say, oh, what's this over

410
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,086
here? Is this still connected to this incident? Is this something new?

411
00:25:05,268 --> 00:25:08,766
Right? When the response has ended, that incident is ended. If something else

412
00:25:08,788 --> 00:25:12,320
is popping up, it might require a different response process.

413
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:17,006
In summary, for the incidents commander, everyone is focused,

414
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:20,162
keeps decision making, moving, helps avoid the bystander effect,

415
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:24,386
and you're moving forward towards a revolution. Now, all of

416
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:27,906
that was just the incident commander. The rest of the

417
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:31,640
rules aren't going to take as long to explain. So let's go through.

418
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,790
We have scribe, the deputy,

419
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:38,760
then we have the liaisons and the SMEs. As mentioned before,

420
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,786
deputy role incident commander keeps focus, takes on any additional tasks.

421
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:46,358
This is the scaling problem. If there's too much going on that the IC can't

422
00:25:46,374 --> 00:25:49,142
do by themselves, if there's too many execs coming in to ask for status updates,

423
00:25:49,206 --> 00:25:53,094
whatever, all that is, the deputy. They serve to follow up on reminders

424
00:25:53,142 --> 00:25:56,558
to ensure tasks aren't missed. So in that time boxing example, if I as an

425
00:25:56,564 --> 00:26:00,094
incident commander, am not following up with the DBA in ten to 15 minutes,

426
00:26:00,212 --> 00:26:03,666
the deputy says, hey, it's been 18 minutes, or they act as

427
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:07,730
a hot standby per previous comments about being able to have handoffs.

428
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,182
Importance of the scribe. They're documenting the timeline with context,

429
00:26:13,326 --> 00:26:16,738
and the incident log is used to augment what they're writing in the

430
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:20,694
postmortem process. Note when important actions are taken, follow up

431
00:26:20,732 --> 00:26:24,326
items, etc. Any status updates and similar to the deputy and the

432
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:27,686
IC, anyone can be ascribed. You do not need the technical knowledge or the

433
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:31,242
resolution knowledge to write down what's happening. So again, dont box

434
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:34,570
yourself to just the engineering for all of theyre roles.

435
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,214
Similar for liaison roles. You can have internal and external liaisons,

436
00:26:40,262 --> 00:26:43,570
or both as a single role or both as separate roles. It depends on what's

437
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:47,230
happening and what you need. They're notifying the relevant parties of what's happening.

438
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,874
We usually recommend this happens in about a 30 minutes cadence.

439
00:26:51,002 --> 00:26:54,270
If it's too frequent, people aren't chalking and they're just getting overwhelmed with information.

440
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:58,558
And if it's too infrequent, people, especially people who maybe

441
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:00,626
I pick on execs a lot because they're the ones that are going to be

442
00:27:00,648 --> 00:27:04,386
getting calls. If this is a massive incident and they're popping in because they don't

443
00:27:04,408 --> 00:27:07,990
have information, it is common to have this be a member of support.

444
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,430
Though some pitfalls.

445
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,378
Executive Swoop is the one I mentioned the most. We sometimes nick

446
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:18,806
nickname it executive Swoop and poop. The idea is people are

447
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:22,618
swooping in because they don't have enough information and they're trying to get information

448
00:27:22,704 --> 00:27:25,100
out of you while you're solving the incident as a result.

449
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,402
Or sometimes they try to be helpful. Can we resolve this in some

450
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:32,298
number of minutes, please? We all wish we could.

451
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,194
Right. But again, this isn't meant to be malicious.

452
00:27:35,242 --> 00:27:38,526
People just want to be encouraging or say, have you thought

453
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:42,126
about things? Or they want more information so theyre can

454
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:45,510
talk to people. Maybe they have a dependency. Right. Can I at least know who's

455
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,820
impacted so I can start making phone calls. Right.

456
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,930
That's all stuff you want to kind of buffer again in the incidents response process.

457
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,170
You want those command and communication roles to buffer the responder roles.

458
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,746
There's also a certain amount of do what I say. Oh, did you reboot backluster?

459
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:05,750
Oh, did you do this? Maybe. But we

460
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,286
in the incident call context have been having a conversation for however long and

461
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:12,806
then the person who just joined in has none of that history yet.

462
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:16,714
Right. One of the things that you can do though, in this case is ask

463
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:19,866
people if they wish to take command, because if they're an incidents commander and they

464
00:28:19,888 --> 00:28:22,330
take command, like if they're trained in that role,

465
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,410
sure, then it's not your problem. Right. And if they say no,

466
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,966
just say, great, in that case I need you to, and then give them

467
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:32,318
some direction. I need you to wait for the next status update. I need you

468
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:35,658
to wait till we send out the information or whatever. Right? So make

469
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:39,506
sure you always ask this question if someone's being a little bit persistent, because again,

470
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:43,060
it's not normally malicious, they're as anxious as everybody else.

471
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,262
Another common pitfall is that failure to notify. That's why the liaison rule is separated

472
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:50,806
out. If you don't notify people, they're going to ping you in slack in the

473
00:28:50,828 --> 00:28:54,326
call or wherever to get information on the opposite side.

474
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:57,794
If you ping them too often, it's not usually necessary and it doesn't have enough

475
00:28:57,852 --> 00:29:01,782
information or the status updates are too similar to warrant the frequency.

476
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:06,362
Right. Red herrings are

477
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:10,186
things that happen in incidents that are just misleading. This isn't really a part of

478
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:13,706
the incidents response process breaking down. This is just the

479
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:17,918
resolution process breaking down where you think that you need to do something and

480
00:29:18,084 --> 00:29:21,774
ends up being a dependency or something else that looks like it's happening over here

481
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:25,198
and it's happening over there. I'm not going

482
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:28,706
to go through all the anti patterns here. Suffice it to say, there are

483
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:31,934
lots of things that happen during an incident that can bog down the response.

484
00:29:31,982 --> 00:29:34,978
Debating of the severity is something we covered a lot earlier. If you spend your

485
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:38,274
time saying, is this an incidents? Is this not an incidents? Is it a four

486
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:41,426
or a five? Is it a two? Is it a three? You're going to lose

487
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:45,126
time, right? If you don't have the process defined in advance, you're going to

488
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:48,546
lose time. If you don't send out policy changes or have them documented

489
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,814
in a single place, people are going to lose time trying to find them and

490
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:55,274
so on. What I do want to call out though, is assuming silence means no

491
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:58,410
progress. If you think about it, heads down or reading a book,

492
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,914
even decoupling from incidents, right. Silence doesn't

493
00:30:01,962 --> 00:30:05,658
necessarily mean stopping. Silence just means I haven't

494
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:07,440
been able to send you anything yet.

495
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,640
How do I prepare to manage incident response team?

496
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,782
Step one, ensure explicit processes and expectations

497
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:19,810
exist. See this entire presentation.

498
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:24,386
Step two, practice running a major incident as a team. This is kind

499
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:27,534
of like failure Fridays, which is something we run at pagerduty to practice chaos

500
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:31,062
experiments. Run your major incident response as part of it. Why not?

501
00:30:31,116 --> 00:30:35,026
Right? If you have rare incident, that's awesome. But if you don't practice what you're

502
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:38,950
doing when they do happen, you're not going to be as agile.

503
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,002
It'll also give you the opportunity to tune your process to know what works.

504
00:30:43,056 --> 00:30:46,266
You don't want to find out in the first real incident that you have with

505
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:49,340
your new process that it didn't work for you.

506
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,634
Something that can help with this is checklists. That way you know what you've done,

507
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,094
you haven't done what you need to change next time. It can look a little

508
00:30:56,132 --> 00:30:59,246
bit like this again, I'm not going to go

509
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:02,718
through each one of these, but please feel free to screenshot or look at the

510
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:04,480
slides. I'll have a link at the end.

511
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,534
Something else I want to call out don't neglect the post mortem.

512
00:31:09,662 --> 00:31:12,946
It's really easy to forget because the incidents is done. We go back

513
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:16,114
to regularly schedule activities or we do any of the action items that we take

514
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:19,826
away from it and writing everything down just like docs

515
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:22,966
kind of gets lost. But if you don't document things in the post mortem when

516
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:25,800
things are fresh, then you're going to lose the learning opportunity.

517
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:29,718
So as an overview, you want to make sure you're covering the high level of

518
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:33,626
the impact. This is just a quick our shopping cart service was down and

519
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:37,274
customers could not purchase new items. Something like that. It's not meant to be very

520
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,902
in depth at that level. And then in the what happens sections,

521
00:31:41,046 --> 00:31:44,594
detailed descriptions of what are happening, what response efforts

522
00:31:44,662 --> 00:31:47,390
happen. This is when you can really make use of those scribe notes.

523
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,146
Then you review the response process itself, what went well, what didn't,

524
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:55,246
and write down any action items as a

525
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:58,866
slide to screenshot. Here are some things that you can include in a more

526
00:31:58,888 --> 00:32:02,258
detailed post mortem I actually will have a link to a

527
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:05,734
post mortem ops guide that we wrote up here at page duty at the end,

528
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:09,560
so hold on to your seats there

529
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,290
as a quick summary, use the incident command system for managing incidents.

530
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:18,722
An incident commander takes charge during wartime scenarios. Set expectations

531
00:32:18,786 --> 00:32:22,326
upward. That specifically refers to the CEO comment

532
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:25,498
about the incident commander being the top one, but basically everything else, right? You want

533
00:32:25,504 --> 00:32:29,398
to communicate outward, work with your team to set explicit expectations

534
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:33,500
and process practice. And don't forget to review

535
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,998
all of the links including the post mortem. One I just mentioned are going to

536
00:32:38,004 --> 00:32:41,630
be on this noticed page. So go ahead and go here. I have

537
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,690
four guides there about response and post mortems

538
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,246
and the meetings associated. The topmost link,

539
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:52,666
in case you want to see it just now, is the response Ops guide.

540
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:56,406
That Ops guide is an expansion of this pre presentation. So if you want

541
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:59,158
to read more or want to recap everything I've mentioned here,

542
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:02,726
it's on this slide and with that I'll go ahead and go to

543
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:06,070
Q A. I'll be available in the discord and the link

544
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,798
for all of the links that I've mentioned in this presentation again, are going to

545
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:13,010
be on that notice page. Thank you and have a great conference.
