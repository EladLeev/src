00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,646
Hello, I'm Daniel, and it's a pleasure to be here today

2
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:27,046
and to talk to you. So, in my presentation, I'm going to

3
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,358
explain how qubits differ from classical bits, and I'm

4
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:34,082
going to look at where quantum computing can have an advantage over classical

5
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:37,714
computing. So our existing NISC quantum

6
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:41,654
devices have limitations, and I'm going to talk about how these might be resolved

7
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:45,338
in the future. And we'll look at a future where we might see large,

8
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:48,506
fault tolerant, universal quantum computers that will

9
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:51,882
be truly transformational. So, for the moment, the three

10
00:00:51,936 --> 00:00:55,914
use cases for near term quantum devices are quantum

11
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:59,482
optimization, quantum simulation of physical systems,

12
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:03,040
particularly quantum systems and quantum machine learning.

13
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,554
So my amazing colleague PipPa will talk about these use cases and

14
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,946
their possible business benefits. And then Pippa will go

15
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:14,114
on and look at our quantum data center of the Future Technology

16
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:17,574
Access program Qtap, which launches in

17
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:20,806
September. This free program will give education,

18
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:24,466
training in quantum computing, access to experts,

19
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:27,918
to reviews use cases, and access to quantum computing

20
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,500
simulation tools, and the Orca PT one quantum computer.

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,702
So Qtap is a unique chance for business users

22
00:01:35,766 --> 00:01:39,754
to get started on their quantum journey. But before I start

23
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:43,514
that, I'd just like to briefly

24
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,778
describe digital catapult, the organization

25
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:50,634
that I represent. So, digital Catapult is the UK authority

26
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:54,514
on advanced digital technology. And through collaboration and

27
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:58,978
innovation, we accelerate industry adoption to drive growth and opportunity

28
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:02,414
across the economy. So our technologies

29
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:06,482
include five g and six g, artificial intelligence

30
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:10,214
and machine learning, immersive technologies, Internet of

31
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:13,830
Things, distributed ledger, and now quantum.

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,582
And we deliver acceleration and innovation programs.

33
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:21,114
We build test beds and demonstrators, and we

34
00:02:21,152 --> 00:02:24,780
facilitate r and D projects. So now I'm going to

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,930
start my overview of quantum computing.

36
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,334
And you're probably feeling a bit bombarded at the moment because

37
00:02:32,372 --> 00:02:35,818
there's a lot of information out there about quantum computing.

38
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:39,706
And maybe you're wondering, is this hype,

39
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,750
is this another it boom and bust cycle?

40
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,386
Are there really opportunities for my organization, or is

41
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:49,570
it forever five years away? Should I get started

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,994
now? And if so, how should I get

43
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:56,886
started? But before we answer those questions,

44
00:02:56,988 --> 00:03:00,306
let's go back to basics and let's describe

45
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:04,898
what a qubit is. And let's do that by a thought experiment.

46
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:08,314
The quantum egg timer. So the

47
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,580
quantum egg timer starts off as full,

48
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,882
just like a classical egg timer. And at the end of the thought

49
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:19,210
experiment, the quantum egg timer is empty,

50
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,920
just like the classical egg timer. But in the middle of the

51
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,014
thought experiment, something quite unusual happens.

52
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:31,450
Because it's a quantum egg timer, it knows

53
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,234
the sound comes in lumps. Quantum means a

54
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:38,834
lump. And so it knows it can't be half full and

55
00:03:38,872 --> 00:03:42,850
half empty. It's got to be either full or empty.

56
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,522
And the way this conundrum gets resolved is if we actually

57
00:03:47,576 --> 00:03:50,742
measure the quantum ectiler, half the time,

58
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:54,566
we find it full. And the other half of the time, we find it

59
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:58,278
empty. So this quantum mechanical effect.

60
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,322
Is completely outside of our normal experience.

61
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,618
Because the objects we see in our day to day life.

62
00:04:04,784 --> 00:04:08,934
Made up of billions and billions of atoms. And the quantum mechanical effects

63
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:12,734
typically get washed out. And so a qubit is

64
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:16,080
just like the quantum egg timer. And it has similar states.

65
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,560
So, like the egg timer, the qubit starts off

66
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,706
in a full state. So a qubit might be

67
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:28,510
an electron in a magnetic field, maybe an electron

68
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,258
in an atom. And it has an excited state and a

69
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:35,890
ground state. But whatever, it just starts off

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,654
in one state. There's nothing strange or

71
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:43,318
weird about that. But if we take a qubit. And we drive it with

72
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:46,998
a pulse of electromagnetic radiation. Of exactly the

73
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:49,586
right frequency and right duration.

74
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:52,730
We can drive it into this superposition state.

75
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,138
Where it is literally in two states at the same time.

76
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:59,954
And then if we continue the pulse, we can then drive it into the ground

77
00:05:00,022 --> 00:05:03,854
state. So, so far, very good.

78
00:05:04,052 --> 00:05:07,466
Very interesting. But you're probably wondering,

79
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:10,590
what has this got to do with computing?

80
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,546
Well, as you well know, in your classical device in the

81
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:18,100
computer, I'm recording this in in my mobile phone.

82
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,990
The units of computation are either

83
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,934
on or they're off. But a qubit is different.

84
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:32,658
A qubit is on if it's

85
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:36,258
in the excited state or off if it's

86
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:39,394
in the ground state. But it can be in this weird

87
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:43,354
superposition of started. Where it's literally in two states at

88
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:47,494
the same time. And it's parallel processing over mini qubits

89
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:50,854
in superposition. That can give quantum computers

90
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:54,318
huger benefits over classical computers for certain

91
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:58,094
algorithms. So all classical computers are

92
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:02,438
fundamentally the same. They all work in a sequential manner.

93
00:06:02,634 --> 00:06:06,562
It's like reading a book letter by

94
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,530
letter, word by word, sentence by sentence.

95
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,302
Whereas quantum computer is like reading

96
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:18,406
the whole book all at the same time. So another

97
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:22,850
important quantum mechanical concept

98
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,374
for quantum computing is entanglement. And the idea

99
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:29,926
of entanglement is that two qubits are very closely

100
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,466
correlated. So maybe we

101
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:37,946
measure qubit one, and we find it's in the

102
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:41,346
excited state. Well, that means that if we measure

103
00:06:41,398 --> 00:06:44,846
qubit two. Then it will be in

104
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:48,046
the ground state and vice versa. If we

105
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:51,838
measure qubit one and it's in the ground state, qubit two will be

106
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:56,110
in the excited state. But so far, actually, that's not really that mysterious

107
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,846
that similar correlations can be found in classical systems.

108
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,626
But say that I measure the qubit by changing the

109
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:07,380
magnetic field so that it goes into the screen,

110
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,474
and I measure it, and I find that it's pointing

111
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:15,094
out of the screen. One of the qubits is pointing out the

112
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:18,040
screen. That means the other qubit will be pointing into the screen.

113
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,026
And if I find that one of the qubits is pointing into the screen,

114
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,674
that means that the other qubit is pointing out of the screen.

115
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:29,402
And entanglement is a very interesting effect,

116
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:33,086
not only because it's a primitive for quantum computing, but it forms the

117
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:35,310
basis of quantum key distribution,

118
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,086
because measuring one qubit effectively forces the

119
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:43,234
other into a known quantum state. If someone comes

120
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:46,962
and measures the qubit, then effectively, they can mess

121
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:50,706
up the quantum distribution. So, now let's have

122
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:54,530
a look at a quantum computing circuit.

123
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,706
So, this quantum computing circuit has two qubits,

124
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:03,350
and the time advances from left to right during the computation.

125
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,394
So the two qubits start off, and they're initialized.

126
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:11,638
That means they're both in the ground state, and then a quantum

127
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:15,066
single qubit gate is applied. It's called the

128
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:19,254
Hadamal gate. And that sounds like very mysterious.

129
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:22,574
What does it do? But in actual fact, we've seen that

130
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:27,134
before, because the Hadamar gate does nothing more than take a

131
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:31,482
qubit in the ground state and force it into superposition

132
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:35,266
of two states. And then we move on, and we see something we

133
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:38,510
haven't seen before, a quantum two qubit gate.

134
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,194
And that means that the state of the top qubit can

135
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:45,230
influence the state of the bottom qubit.

136
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,158
This is actually a c zero gate, and it means that if the

137
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:52,390
top qubit is in the excited state, the bottom

138
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,440
qubit will be forced to flip its state,

139
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,154
and the computation advances. And at the end,

140
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:04,186
we make a measurement, and we get a classical bitstream out.

141
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:08,134
And the reason I've shown this is because it quite nicely

142
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,954
shows the limitations that we have at the moment.

143
00:09:11,152 --> 00:09:14,286
So, the first challenge that we have at the moment with

144
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:17,834
the quantum devices of today is that there's noise.

145
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:22,010
The quantum states are very fragile. They easily get disrupted.

146
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,338
And because of this noise, the gate depth is quite limited.

147
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:29,378
You really, for someone quantum alchemist, want to stack up a

148
00:09:29,384 --> 00:09:33,870
large number of gates. But if you try and do that, often, the signal

149
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,970
just gets washed out by noise. The second challenge

150
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,190
is the number of qubits is quite limited.

151
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,906
To do worthwhile computations, we ideally want thousands

152
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:48,806
of error free qubits. At the moment,

153
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:53,130
IBM have a device of 433

154
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,874
noisy qubits. So we're maybe quite some way away from where we

155
00:09:56,912 --> 00:10:00,178
need to be. And the third challenge is that, ideally,

156
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:03,610
for our quantum algorithm, we want all the qubits connected,

157
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,430
each qubit connected to every other qubit.

158
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,570
But in quantum devices, that connectivity is quite limited.

159
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,482
Maybe one qubit might be connected to only two or three

160
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,066
other qubits. So let's look at

161
00:10:18,088 --> 00:10:21,726
where we are today and the likely next steps.

162
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:25,134
But to do that, let's have a quick look at the history of quantum

163
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:28,214
computing. So, in the 1980s,

164
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,858
the fundamental concepts were developed. David Deutsch

165
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:35,862
described a universal quantum computer. Universal means

166
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,970
it's a quantum computer that can run any algorithm.

167
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,342
And Richard Feynman, an american physicist,

168
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,622
proposed a quantum computer to simulate physical

169
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,178
systems. And then in the 90s,

170
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:53,280
some quantum algorithms were developed, almost 30 years ago now.

171
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,346
And the strange thing about the algorithms was David

172
00:10:58,378 --> 00:11:02,406
Deutsch also realized that it's possible to have a quantum speed

173
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,666
up because he designed an algorithm where a

174
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:09,154
quantum computer could do a computing in one

175
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:13,406
shot, but it would take a classical computer, two shots.

176
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:16,902
And Shaw expanded on that idea,

177
00:11:16,956 --> 00:11:20,726
and he developed an algorithm to factorize prime numbers on

178
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:24,486
a quantum computer. That seems to come with the promise that it

179
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:27,922
will take a quantum computer, a polynomial

180
00:11:27,986 --> 00:11:31,670
number of steps for a calculation. It would take a classical

181
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:35,562
computer, an exponential number of steps. What that means

182
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:39,162
in practice is that we'll be able to factorize large numbers

183
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:43,006
on a quantum computer one day, that we wouldn't be able to factorize on

184
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:46,782
a classical computer. And the relevance of that

185
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:51,034
is that Shaw's algorithm could be used to crack the RSA

186
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:54,370
encryption. That's very common in the Internet.

187
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,946
But at that time, the discussion of

188
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,786
the basic foundational concepts and the discussion of algorithms was an

189
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:06,946
academic. It was a theoretical discussion. There were no quantum

190
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:10,806
devices. In fact, some people thought that quantum computers could never be

191
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:14,930
built. But this century, we actually have devices

192
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,746
for the first time. And you can see that I plotted a

193
00:12:18,768 --> 00:12:22,694
graph of IBM, the scale of IBM

194
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:26,346
device sizes. The reason for choosing IBM is that they

195
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:29,910
have a clear roadmap, and they publish the size of

196
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,918
their current device. And in blue, we've got the

197
00:12:33,924 --> 00:12:37,930
actual device size. In orange, we've got their plans

198
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,894
for the next three years. And then in yellow,

199
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:47,374
I've extrapolated what size quantum computers

200
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:51,618
might reach. And I have to emphasize that

201
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,054
to get to quantum computers with

202
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:59,894
millions of qubits, then we need fundamental breakthroughs in

203
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:03,478
research to overcome some of the problems. Say, for example,

204
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:07,160
quantum error correction is a problem.

205
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,420
So, quantum error correction is where you try and

206
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,220
reduce the impact of noise by having,

207
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,970
instead of one physical qubit that's quite prone to error,

208
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,570
club the physical qubits together into a logical qubit.

209
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,494
If one of the physical qubits loses its quantum state,

210
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:32,846
it doesn't matter, because there's enough redundancy and information in

211
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:36,706
the other quantum qubits that you can

212
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:40,130
detect, correct, and detect the error.

213
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,818
So, in summary, at the moment, we're in the near scale intermediate

214
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:49,666
quantum era. So there's a few noisy

215
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:53,014
qubits. And the algorithms that can be run in this

216
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:56,994
era are quite specialized, and they're typically hybrid algorithms,

217
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:00,406
where a quantum computer works side by side with a

218
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:04,300
classical computer. But the promises is in that the future,

219
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,134
the technological challenges will be resolved.

220
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:12,026
We'll see large, universal, fault tolerant quantum computers.

221
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:16,286
Fault tolerant means that there's error correction involved and

222
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:20,222
that these devices promise to be truly transformational and

223
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,310
help maybe with material science,

224
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,766
developing new materials, maybe superconductors,

225
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:30,530
new drugs, better weather forecasting,

226
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,466
really quite transformational and quite dramatic effects on the

227
00:14:34,488 --> 00:14:38,246
world. And, of course, they'll be able to run Shaw's algorithm. And so

228
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:42,470
they're a threat as well, because they can crack our encryption schemes.

229
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,506
So, in the nisk era, to do anything useful,

230
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:51,514
we can't have very deep quantum circuits. But what

231
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:54,858
we can have, and what looks as if there might be a

232
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:58,522
promising route of attack, is something called

233
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:02,094
variational quantum algorithms. And the idea is

234
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:06,126
that we take a parameterized quantum circuit. So that

235
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:09,934
means a quantum circuit where there's some parameters on the gate that

236
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:14,014
we can change. And that parameterized

237
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:18,580
quantum circuit maps to an optimization function,

238
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,894
maybe for quantum machine learning, it maps to some loss

239
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:26,486
function, and then we run the quantum circuit a

240
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,114
number of times. We get a classical output, we evaluate

241
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,846
the classical output, and then we tune the quantum computer

242
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:37,834
by using the classical computer to pass back in

243
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:40,742
a feedback loop the parameters.

244
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:44,906
And then the new parameters are used in a further iteration, and we continue

245
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:48,810
around until, hopefully, our quantum computers will

246
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,520
carry out a useful calculation for us.

247
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,106
So now I'm going to hand over to my colleague Pippa,

248
00:15:56,218 --> 00:16:00,538
and Pippa is going to talk about quantum computing use cases.

249
00:16:00,714 --> 00:16:04,290
Thank you very much for your attention. Great. Thanks,

250
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,190
Daniel. So, let's take a look at some of the applications

251
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,410
of quantum computing in the near term.

252
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,106
The key areas that have been identified as applications of

253
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:18,674
quantum computing in the more nearer term are the following.

254
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:22,594
So we've got optimization, quantum simulation of physical

255
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:26,246
systems and quantum machine learning. If we

256
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:29,674
start by taking a look at optimization, this is quite

257
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:33,110
simply the ability to optimize processes,

258
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,494
networks, facilities by utilizing quantum

259
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:41,600
annealing or variational algorithms in the quantum circuit model.

260
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,074
Applications of this can include optimizing

261
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:49,646
energy networks. So as energy networks become more and

262
00:16:49,668 --> 00:16:53,078
more complex, with more and more assets on the network,

263
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:56,334
being able to optimize that and make it as efficient

264
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,178
as possible is going to be really key. Optimization of

265
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,980
the telecoms network is another one,

266
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,770
also optimization of logistics. So fleet.

267
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,786
So is there a better way to send parcels

268
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:13,750
around the country, send deliveries round,

269
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,390
even optimizing air cargo routes, or quite simply,

270
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,490
factory flows within a manufacturing plant or a factory?

271
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,086
Secondly, you've got quantum simulation of physical systems.

272
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:31,886
So quantum computing can simulate a physical system such

273
00:17:31,908 --> 00:17:34,030
as computational fluid dynamics.

274
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,614
And using quantum computing to

275
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:41,694
do this can enable more accurate simulation of

276
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:45,986
airflow or fluid flow over an aerofoil or

277
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:48,690
a vehicle or a marine vessel.

278
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,870
And it can be also leveraged for pharmaceuticals.

279
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,634
So it can actually simulate a quantum system, because molecules

280
00:17:57,682 --> 00:18:01,494
are a quantum system. So quantum computing can

281
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:05,410
predict or simulate the structure and properties

282
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,010
and the behavior of molecules, so it can help in drug discovery.

283
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,446
And finally, we've got using quantum computing or certain machine

284
00:18:15,478 --> 00:18:18,954
learning applications. So these can

285
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:22,558
be the machine learning applications that we have today.

286
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:26,986
But quantum computing can help increase the speed and accuracy,

287
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:30,382
also improve scalability, and help

288
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:33,650
with more efficient use of resource in that context.

289
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,898
So with all this potential that quantum computing can bring,

290
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:43,086
it's really important for yourself and your organizations

291
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:47,414
to be ready for when quantum computing is

292
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:50,790
to be adopted into organizations.

293
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,110
So there are things that you can do for future proof.

294
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,634
Firstly, post quantum cryptography is so,

295
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:01,660
so important.

296
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,726
Quantum computing algorithm, known as Shaw's algorithm,

297
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:12,126
could break our widely users RSA encryption in the

298
00:19:12,148 --> 00:19:16,640
next decade. So that means the data that you have around you today

299
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,280
is not safe in the future.

300
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,542
Therefore, you need to understand the timeline

301
00:19:24,686 --> 00:19:27,794
of this, the steps that you might need to

302
00:19:27,832 --> 00:19:31,454
take to make your business safe. There is massive

303
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:35,386
amounts of information encrypted using the RSA

304
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:38,870
encryption today. It could take an awfully long

305
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,134
time for us to future proof that and make that

306
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:45,030
safe against quantum computing.

307
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,020
So we should be starting to do that now.

308
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,442
Secondly, we still don't really know the full extent of how

309
00:19:54,496 --> 00:19:57,754
and when quantum computing will be used, but there really

310
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:01,200
are some clear benefits and applications that we can see.

311
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,998
But it's important to understand that technology today,

312
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:09,534
because what happens if you have a business process

313
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:13,614
or a discovery that is reliant

314
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,818
on quantum computing, but you've not

315
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:20,974
upskilled your organization or educated

316
00:20:21,102 --> 00:20:25,174
the organization in that technology, there will come

317
00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:28,840
a point where it could be too late and you'll be on the back foot.

318
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,334
So look to derisk the investment today in

319
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:37,320
quantum computing by accessing education,

320
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,930
upskilling your employees, and exploring how

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,850
the technology can be leveraged in your organization.

322
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,022
And there are plenty of organizations and programs out there

323
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:54,062
that are looking to do just that to work with you to help

324
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:58,042
you understand and build a roadmap

325
00:20:58,106 --> 00:20:59,360
to support the technology.

326
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,338
Digital catapult are running a quantum technology access

327
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:10,206
program, which is part of a wider program called the Quantum

328
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:13,842
Data center of the Future. And that program is

329
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:17,078
looking to embed a quantum computer within a

330
00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,326
classical data center. And this is

331
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:24,646
sort of translating from the lab environment into

332
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:28,266
potentially a real world application. So how are we going to

333
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:32,330
use quantum computers in the future in a real scenario?

334
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,194
The technology access program aims to upskill and

335
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:41,390
educate end users on the applications of quantum computing.

336
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,614
And it will do this by providing training on what

337
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:49,550
quantum computing is on the core principles, the core skills,

338
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:53,362
and also provide access to expertise in the field,

339
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:57,854
both in house at digital catapult and our external

340
00:21:57,982 --> 00:22:02,002
consortium partners, and provide

341
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:06,114
you with the opportunity to explore relevant

342
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:10,310
use cases, relevant applications with these experts,

343
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,726
and experiment with the technology by running sort of

344
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:18,378
quantum simulations and getting hands on experience with a

345
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:21,930
quantum computer. So it's a great

346
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,306
opportunity to get involved, start to

347
00:22:25,328 --> 00:22:28,554
understand the technology, upskill employees within your

348
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:32,430
organization. If you are interested, our open

349
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,902
call goes live the start of July this year,

350
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:39,550
and you can apply via the digital catapult website

351
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,880
if you're interested.

352
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,182
The program will be a structured program and will be delivered

353
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:50,594
over a five month period. And it's split into

354
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:54,718
a few different stages, so you've got your onboarding. So bringing

355
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:59,142
in the cohort together, starting to really understand where

356
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:02,786
everybody is, some master courses to sort of upskill

357
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:07,094
and get everybody to a foundational level, and also for

358
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:10,298
us to understand what you want out of the program so we

359
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:12,940
can tailor the program to support your needs.

360
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,866
You've then got the discovery phase, so this is where

361
00:23:17,968 --> 00:23:22,830
there'll be a lot more training specific

362
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,062
to your needs and also

363
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:30,494
an opportunity to explore use cases in the three

364
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:34,350
different streams. So you've got bulk tolerance,

365
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,002
you've got optimization, and you've got machine learning. So this

366
00:23:38,056 --> 00:23:42,420
helps us tailor the program specific to what your use case is.

367
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,754
Then an opportunity, as I said before, to experiment with simulations

368
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:51,000
and demonstrate the algorithms on a quantum computer.

369
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:55,926
So really great program, and it will be

370
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:59,500
tailored to the participants of the program.

371
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,314
It's a fantastic opportunity and will provide

372
00:24:04,432 --> 00:24:06,810
the following benefits to your organization.

373
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,582
It's a free program, it's structured that will

374
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:15,354
provide tailored support. So this helps ensure efficient

375
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:18,686
use of your time of your employees time to join the

376
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:22,474
program. It's a great opportunity to access experts

377
00:24:22,522 --> 00:24:26,062
in the field and explore use cases.

378
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:29,970
So it doesn't matter if you don't understand how

379
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,746
your organization could leverage quantum computing. This program can

380
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:37,842
help you with that, so it can help explore what the potential use cases

381
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:41,558
could be for you and develop

382
00:24:41,644 --> 00:24:44,470
those use cases relevant to the organization.

383
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:50,330
You'll get access to quantum hardware and software without

384
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,090
having to invest at this stage, so it's derisking those future

385
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,342
investments. Access to network partners

386
00:24:58,406 --> 00:25:02,000
to help you build your network in the quantum computing space

387
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,302
upskill employees within your organization and

388
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,050
ultimately get on the front footing.

389
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,094
So help you understand the technology, the applications,

390
00:25:13,162 --> 00:25:16,994
the timescales to better understand what

391
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:21,330
you need to do as an organization to be ready for quantum computing.

392
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,520
So get involved today. Future proof your business

393
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,238
and if you are interested in the Quantum technology

394
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:35,030
access program, as I say, the open call will be

395
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,040
live the start of July on our website,

396
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,066
but we can support you in a number of different ways. So if you'd

397
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:46,146
like to have a chat with us, please get in touch with myself and Daniel

398
00:25:46,258 --> 00:25:49,526
at our quantum computing email address which is on

399
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,386
the screen it now and thank you for listening.

400
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:55,820
Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.
