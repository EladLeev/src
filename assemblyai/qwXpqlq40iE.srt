00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,400
Hi, my name is Gregoruk and I would like to welcome you

2
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,076
on my talk on the Conf 42 Chaos engineering.

3
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:11,172
And I would like to talk to you about the test estimation.

4
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:14,584
Before we jump straight into the topic, I would like also

5
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:18,280
to introduce myself a little. But so I have over twelve

6
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,212
years of experience in the test or the quality assurance

7
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:25,756
area. I did manual testing in my life, I did the

8
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:30,072
test automation, I designed the frameworks for test automation,

9
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:34,584
I tested the software on the real hardware, I tested it in the simulated

10
00:02:34,632 --> 00:02:38,540
environment, I've designed the processes, I've managed the testing teams,

11
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,972
I connected the testing process to the other software delivery lifecycle

12
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:46,752
activities and stuff like this. So if you think about the quality

13
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:50,276
assurance activities, I probably did them in

14
00:02:50,298 --> 00:02:53,444
my life, in my career many, many times. And on top

15
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:57,584
of that, I've started to work with the project management

16
00:02:57,632 --> 00:03:01,860
activities recently and much bigger teams.

17
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,024
So bringing my experience together, I would like to talk to you about

18
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:09,348
the test estimation. And second title

19
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:13,524
to this presentation is how did I become a fortune teller? But before

20
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:17,096
we start, I have to admit

21
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:20,952
that I had a little bit of the dilemma. I was wondering

22
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:24,430
if I should tell to you about

23
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,720
the methods of the test estimation, or maybe I should

24
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,192
show you how I approach this subject so give you

25
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:35,744
more insights in my approach to the

26
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,312
problem of the test estimation. And I think that you can find in

27
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:42,596
Google all the test estimation methods, like how

28
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:46,084
you can estimate the test. What's more important to us,

29
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,460
to the QA people is how to approach this problem,

30
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,256
actually. So let's start to this

31
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:56,244
topic from a couple of the data which I collected.

32
00:03:56,372 --> 00:04:00,120
So, in Poland, the country where I came from, we have

33
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,792
34 million of people. Among those, we have 75,000

34
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:08,152
of fortune tellers, bionerg, therapists and seers.

35
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:11,656
56% of citizens of Poland actually uses

36
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:15,064
their service. And the price per single service is in range

37
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:18,752
starting from $1, ending up on even $250

38
00:04:18,806 --> 00:04:22,464
per one single service. And why

39
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:25,392
I'm telling all of this to you? Well, look at that.

40
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:28,960
There is like almost 60% of people believing

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,612
or trying to believe or wanting to believe in

42
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,240
the activities or services provided by the fortune tellers.

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,436
But when I read through all of the

44
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:43,860
job descriptions on the job markets

45
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,168
about the quality assurance engineers, I did not found any

46
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:51,656
mention about the test estimation in

47
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:53,960
the activities performed by the qas.

48
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,884
That's pretty much started for me. I started

49
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,500
to wonder why it's happening like that. And I started

50
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,324
in this business in times when testing was perceived as

51
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:08,748
some sort of negative activity, which has only focused on finding

52
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:11,890
the issues and pretty much interrupt the entire process.

53
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,880
And I thought about this like, hey,

54
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,824
why project managers, why people who are responsible

55
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:22,676
for delivery chain, they want to know the estimation date

56
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:26,288
or the estimation time of the development activities,

57
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:29,812
but they don't ask the same questions to

58
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:32,984
the QA engineers, why is it like so,

59
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:36,984
and maybe we should look at this problem from the other

60
00:05:37,022 --> 00:05:40,632
side of the coin. So why QA engineers are not

61
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:44,216
giving the test estimation? Well, my theory

62
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:47,736
is pretty simple about that. Probably nobody

63
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,768
cared about the test estimation in the previous

64
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:55,928
projects, in the previous deliveries, in the previous timeframes. So that's

65
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:59,904
why the QA engineers doesn't or do not

66
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:03,408
provide the test estimation anymore. And I

67
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:06,736
think that we should change that, because the test estimation is one of the

68
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:09,860
core activities. If you think about the testing itself,

69
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,500
if you think about delivering the software,

70
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,204
it's pretty much as much important has the

71
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:20,100
estimation of the development activities.

72
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,812
So let's think about the test estimation.

73
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:27,176
If you think about this, what the estimation itself, what is

74
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:30,792
it? So, as Master Yoda said, it's difficult to see,

75
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:34,456
because always in motion is the future. And if you

76
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,860
think about the test estimation, well, it can be hard because we're trying to

77
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,176
predict the future. And if you think about estimation,

78
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:46,472
the people who are doing the estimation, even developers itself,

79
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:50,956
they are often referring to the estimation as guesstimation,

80
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:54,304
because estimation is pretty much a guessing if you

81
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:57,984
try to make it very simple. But for

82
00:06:58,022 --> 00:07:01,412
me, it's more than guessing, because there are certain

83
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:05,124
rules, there are certain things which you can rely on, which makes the

84
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:08,420
guessing much core, much more

85
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,624
reliable activity, I would say. So let's think

86
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:15,240
about this. Why it is worth a while to even

87
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,280
estimate the testing effort? Well,

88
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,952
I think that there are like four key things that

89
00:07:23,006 --> 00:07:26,748
make the test estimation worth a while. First of

90
00:07:26,754 --> 00:07:30,300
all, it helps the resource management. So for everybody

91
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,900
who are like managing the testing process or the delivery cycle,

92
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,352
you can manage the resources. If you know that in project a,

93
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:42,016
you have still a little bit of the capacity of the

94
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:45,570
testing team and you can use it to support the project b,

95
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,664
it also can work in the other

96
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:53,892
site. So if you know already that in

97
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:57,924
the project a, the deadline is really tight and you do not

98
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:01,056
have the resources there, you can use the other team to

99
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:04,280
support these testing activities in project a.

100
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,484
So that helps us, the estimation

101
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:12,360
itself helps QA manager their resources effectively.

102
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,796
Second of all, it gives us safety. We all know that a

103
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:20,636
good business is a happy business. So if you will give

104
00:08:20,658 --> 00:08:24,104
the test estimation to the business or to your insight

105
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:27,804
clients, po, PM, whatever, you will

106
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:31,760
give them a safety, because they will know that you will not sit there and

107
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,450
they will not scratch their heads asking themselves,

108
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,044
our testing team, what they are actually doing and when they will

109
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:42,404
finish. So they will know when they

110
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:45,780
can expect you to finish the testing phase.

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,472
Third of all, it is professional.

112
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:53,040
So there is a lot of rumors

113
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,504
in the QA environment that, hey, if you

114
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:59,896
are estimating the test, probably you cares very professional in what

115
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:03,108
you do, because only the best can do a proper test estimation.

116
00:09:03,284 --> 00:09:07,144
Because the test estimation, or the estimation itself, the very accurate

117
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,572
estimation is based on the experience. So it also

118
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,816
helps to build your own professionalism as a person who knows

119
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:18,844
what they're doing. And the fourth thing, which is supporting

120
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,364
the thesis that it is worth a while to estimate

121
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:26,610
the testing effort, is that you will gain a knowledge. Because to

122
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,828
provide the better estimation, the more accurate estimation you need

123
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:33,924
to gain a knowledge, you need to understand in a better

124
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:37,776
way what you're doing. What are your core

125
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:41,040
activities, what are the core things which you need to check

126
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,032
while doing the testing itself. So those four things

127
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:49,290
altogether will make a test estimation worth a while.

128
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,264
So, if you want to think about the test estimation,

129
00:09:54,312 --> 00:09:57,660
we should focus on three main factors.

130
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,736
What we should estimate, when we should estimate

131
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,350
it, and who should estimate it.

132
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,864
Let's start from the first thing, what we should estimate. So the

133
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:12,640
horse as it is, everyone can see, but what to estimate.

134
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,284
And the thing that I was struggling

135
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,788
the most while I was trying to estimate the test was the

136
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:24,032
fact that if somebody saw my estimation

137
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:27,124
of a single testing task, they thought like, okay,

138
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:30,772
so you need to execute this test like 20 times. So if you

139
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:34,804
need a 1 hour to execute this test, 20 times, one, it gives you

140
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,656
20 hours. So 20 hours done, right?

141
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:41,176
Well, not really. Let's think about this. I will

142
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:44,990
give you a simple example. If you will have a room

143
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,196
where there is 100 of people, and you

144
00:10:49,218 --> 00:10:53,244
will need to take a photo with your phone of

145
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:56,496
a one person. How much time do you need for

146
00:10:56,518 --> 00:11:00,016
that? Like 5 seconds. Take the phone out of your

147
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:03,292
pocket, unlock it, select the camera

148
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:06,736
up, point the camera, take the

149
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:10,444
photo. Done. Right? Let's say 10 seconds.

150
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:13,670
Okay, but if you would have to

151
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,036
make a photo of every single person in this room. So make 100 of

152
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:21,372
photos, it starts to become more complicated,

153
00:11:21,456 --> 00:11:24,916
right? Because even if the steps

154
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:28,184
are the same, the preconditions or something, which we call

155
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:32,552
the environment or the setup is different and

156
00:11:32,606 --> 00:11:36,364
the tear down is different, right? So you cannot say that if

157
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:39,608
you would have to take a photo of hundreds

158
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:43,144
of people. It will take you like thousands of seconds,

159
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:46,716
right? It is much more to that. So you need to

160
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:50,336
know or while trying to estimate, or while you will give

161
00:11:50,358 --> 00:11:53,056
the estimate to someone, you need to underline that,

162
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:57,264
hey, it's not that simple that I will just do

163
00:11:57,302 --> 00:12:01,044
this activity a couple of times and you can just multiply the time

164
00:12:01,082 --> 00:12:03,750
needed for a single task. Times.

165
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,860
How many times I need to do it? So the first thing,

166
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,512
when you do the estimation, you need to think about what

167
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:15,304
you will estimate in the sense that the sum of

168
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:18,504
estimation of single testing task is not a

169
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:22,292
total estimation. Also you need to include

170
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:25,836
the supporting activities. So we know that actually the

171
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:29,564
quality assurance activities can be divided on the

172
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:33,452
quality check and quality control. So quality check

173
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:37,600
is actually the moment when we execute the tests. But quality control

174
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,392
is everything what we do around the test

175
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:44,924
execution. So you need to include the time for supporting

176
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,116
activities like writing down your test cases,

177
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:53,040
connected them with the test base, with the subject of testing,

178
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,852
with the requirements itself. So provide the two way tracking of

179
00:12:56,906 --> 00:13:00,390
testing and the things which you will test.

180
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,424
Then you need to think about, okay, how much time do I

181
00:13:04,462 --> 00:13:07,540
need to report the bugs, to report the testing activities,

182
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,004
to report the results, to create a testing report, to communicate

183
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,756
this, to discuss this. So all of these activities should

184
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:20,444
be included also in the test estimate. And on

185
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:24,136
top of that, we should also contain or include

186
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:26,856
a buffer in our test estimation.

187
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:30,864
Why to do that, for the reasons which

188
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:33,890
I already said. So there is not only like the testing itself,

189
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,872
you need to prepare the environment and stuff like that, but also

190
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:40,020
there are things which you cannot predict.

191
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,830
So for example, the environment will be not available,

192
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,684
there will be other activities. Maybe you will need to think

193
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:51,344
about something. Maybe you will need to discuss whether the requirement

194
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:55,172
is actually correct. Maybe you will need to get some more knowledge.

195
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:58,650
So everything which cannot be predicted straight ahead,

196
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,776
you need to think about this as a buffer, and you need to provide a

197
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,620
buffer in your test estimation.

198
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,724
Okay, that leads us to the second point when we

199
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:13,484
should do the test estimation, because there's never enough time

200
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:18,784
to do all the nothing you want. So by

201
00:14:18,822 --> 00:14:22,240
saying when or asking when we should

202
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,952
estimate the testing effort, I'm not asking you about whether

203
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:30,204
you should estimate this before, during or after testing,

204
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:33,556
or maybe at the beginning of the project, or maybe during. But you should

205
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:37,924
think about this question more about what is the

206
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:40,832
place in time when I'm trying to do the test estimation,

207
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:44,120
what is happening around what is like my environment,

208
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,684
when I am estimating the test effort.

209
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:52,084
And you need to think about many, many factors

210
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:55,640
here. First of all, obviously the stability of their environments.

211
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,496
So whether my testing environments are stable,

212
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:02,844
maybe there's a time of a year, like in the summer when

213
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:05,548
there's super hot and we need to shut down the AC.

214
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:09,236
And as a part of that, our machines

215
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,720
in the server room, they are pretty much slowed down, or they are shut down,

216
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,080
so they are not operating at the full speed. And that

217
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,844
obviously will impact my testing. And also how

218
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:23,840
stable is our application? Maybe we recently

219
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,684
had or observed issues with the performance of the application,

220
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,152
or maybe it crashes while we have some certain

221
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:34,756
circumstances, like exceeded the number of the users.

222
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:38,440
So that should be also included in the test

223
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,120
estimation or taken into consideration. There are other

224
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,644
circumstances, like Covid-19 it

225
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:49,596
had a very big impact on all the

226
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:53,432
activities around different companies, in different industries,

227
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:57,592
because when you're performing your own activities, there might be a

228
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:01,248
necessity to jump to the other project and support

229
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:05,616
someone because he went sick and stuff like that. So as

230
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:10,096
you can see, when you're asking yourself when you should estimate the tests,

231
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:14,196
you should think about all the factors which are happening around you,

232
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:18,132
and that's pretty much, obviously will influence the test

233
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,684
estimation. Jumping to the third factor we

234
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:25,064
have, who should estimate the tests? Well,

235
00:16:25,102 --> 00:16:27,732
obviously, if it is about the testing effort,

236
00:16:27,796 --> 00:16:30,984
obviously the answer to this question is the QA, right?

237
00:16:31,022 --> 00:16:34,170
The QA engineers. But if you think about this,

238
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,332
is it easy for everyone to estimate the testing? We already

239
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:41,740
said that the test estimation is activity which is

240
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,224
perceived as something which is done only by the experienced

241
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:49,088
personnel, experienced QA engineers. Because if

242
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:53,612
you have a lot of experience in the project, you can give a more accurate

243
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:57,024
test estimate, right? So obviously you can

244
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:01,364
bring someone who is like just starting in the QA or

245
00:17:01,402 --> 00:17:05,124
even the IT industry, and he will also be able

246
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:09,408
to give you the estimation. But it won't be such accurate

247
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:13,064
as someone who already worked in the project, work with

248
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:16,372
our application, work within our environment,

249
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,960
in our organization, in our company, and already

250
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:24,656
have some background in testing, and already did the estimation

251
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:28,780
in the past. So obviously the more experienced person,

252
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,504
the better. But obviously you can discuss the estimation,

253
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,392
you can perform the test estimation even if you are not experienced

254
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:41,792
or experienced tester also,

255
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:45,120
who is doing the test estimation. The people who are engaged,

256
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,644
the people who do care about the testing activities,

257
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:52,564
who do care about the quality in our project.

258
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:56,292
So in other words, if you actually do care about

259
00:17:56,346 --> 00:18:00,084
what you do, and you perceived the quality not only as

260
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:03,640
your job, like, yeah, I need to do is like starting from

261
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,970
eight till 08:00 a.m.. Till 04:00 p.m.

262
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,320
But you perceived this as something more, as an important activity,

263
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,940
entire delivery chain, then you are probably

264
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,260
the right person to estimate the tests.

265
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,310
Sorry about that.

266
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,460
And also while thinking about

267
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,824
who is doing the test estimation, you should also think about

268
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:31,856
the company itself because you should consider the

269
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,952
structure in the company, the organizational culture, everything which

270
00:18:36,006 --> 00:18:37,520
influenced the testing.

271
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,204
Sorry. So you should think about

272
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:47,300
while doing the test estimation, how the company actually

273
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,224
approached the problem of test estimation,

274
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:53,544
or maybe approach the problem or the process of

275
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:57,210
quality assurance, because it is very important sometimes,

276
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,770
as I already said, and this is very sad to me,

277
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,716
maybe somebody or even anybody or even no one

278
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:10,364
is wondering how much time

279
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:13,692
do you need for testing? Or maybe nobody is asking this question

280
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:17,756
when nobody is asking. Then you should be the person who actually

281
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:21,308
start this movement from the bottom of

282
00:19:21,314 --> 00:19:24,640
the organization and said, yeah, well, this is important for me to

283
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,480
let you know that I need the time to actually perform

284
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,628
my tests. And it will also give you a comfort that you will have

285
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:36,244
a test estimation and people will know that you need to spend time

286
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:40,436
over the testing. Okay, so what's next?

287
00:19:40,618 --> 00:19:44,456
If we know what to estimate, when to

288
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:47,210
estimate and who should do this, what's next?

289
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,304
Well, the biggest sin about the test estimation or about

290
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:54,924
the activities which we actually perform as a QA is the fact that we

291
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:58,364
are not talking about this or we not communicate this.

292
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:02,300
And even if you think about the testing, you will see that

293
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,660
if something is happening, the sooner

294
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,060
person who is supervising our project,

295
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:13,412
like PM, Po, test manager, whoever,

296
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:17,136
the sooner he knows about the issues, the better. Right? So it

297
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:20,690
is the same with test estimation and the estimate itself.

298
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,596
First of all, you need to communicate this. Even if nobody cares, you need to

299
00:20:24,618 --> 00:20:27,492
say it up and loud like, hey,

300
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,990
I need one week for my testing. I need like full 40 hours.

301
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,792
That's the first thing to do with your test estimation. The second

302
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:40,004
thing, it's not only about being proud from your test estimation

303
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:44,536
that, hey, I actually did it, I'm experienced, I did the test estimation.

304
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:48,376
Yes, I have the estimate. It's not about stopping

305
00:20:48,408 --> 00:20:51,724
there. You need to monitor it. So even if you think about the

306
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:55,944
ISTQB certification and the foundation level knowledge,

307
00:20:56,072 --> 00:20:59,616
you will notice that there's a mention, but this, that it's not

308
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:03,440
only to setting up the plan for testing, it's also to

309
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,770
monitor this, whether we are going according to the plan.

310
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,516
And obviously, if we are not going according to the plan,

311
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:14,244
just update the test estimation. So if you think about

312
00:21:14,282 --> 00:21:18,164
the estimation and actually the safe methodology tells a lot

313
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:23,400
about this. And there's one rule in safe, which directly

314
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,756
calls this a cone of uncertainty.

315
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:30,164
So let's think about the cone, which is wide

316
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:34,024
at this entrance and it gets narrow at the exit. So if you

317
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:37,724
think about this as a timeline and at the start of the project, you get

318
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:41,436
very wide end of the cone. So if

319
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:44,380
you estimate there and if you are inside the core,

320
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:51,024
you can make a mistake by a lot. So your estimation have

321
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:54,352
a very big margin. But if you go with

322
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:57,244
time to the narrow end of the core,

323
00:21:57,372 --> 00:22:01,128
you will probably get more knowledge. You will probably execute

324
00:22:01,164 --> 00:22:04,816
some tests already. You will see how you cares progressing

325
00:22:04,848 --> 00:22:09,204
through your test plan and also burning down your test estimate, and you will

326
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:13,204
be able to update the estimate with the bigger

327
00:22:13,252 --> 00:22:17,080
knowledge, with the bigger experience, with knowledge about the progress you

328
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,964
are making through the testing phase. And probably this estimate

329
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:24,508
will be more accurate and will be way

330
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:28,236
better than the estimate from the very beginning. Is it

331
00:22:28,258 --> 00:22:31,784
bad that you gave an estimate which contained

332
00:22:31,832 --> 00:22:35,932
a big margin? No, because you

333
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:39,496
did not have a knowledge and experience, which you have right now.

334
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:43,116
So that's why I'm telling this to you, that you need to monitor

335
00:22:43,148 --> 00:22:46,864
it and update it. And those three things are equally important.

336
00:22:46,982 --> 00:22:50,244
You need to communicate the test estimate, you need to tell about this,

337
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:54,310
you need to monitor, you need to update it, because think about the situation

338
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,984
when you monitor the test estimation or the execution

339
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:03,896
of the test plan and updating it. You can

340
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:07,620
tell to your supervisor, like anybody who's

341
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,080
monitoring or having an eye on the testing process,

342
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,836
you can tell this to him, like, hey, we are not progressing

343
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:18,156
according to the plan. And at this moment, I can already tell

344
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:21,896
you that I will need additional two days to fulfill the testing

345
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:25,644
activities. And if you say it like two weeks before deadline, it is

346
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:28,030
a way better communicate that,

347
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,004
a way better message that if you tell this one day before the release,

348
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:37,408
like, hey, I need additional two days, right? That's like way

349
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:42,164
worse situation. Okay, so if

350
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:45,812
you have the test estimation, we know what to do with it,

351
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:49,620
then we will probably meet with one of the most common

352
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,744
issue with the test estimation, which you can

353
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:56,712
find or which can be provided by our PMS Po, our test

354
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:00,152
manager, our scrum masters, you name it.

355
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:04,280
Can you do it faster? So they will try to do

356
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,572
their job, they will try to manage the process, they will try to manage

357
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:12,476
the deadlines, they will try to provide the best outcome in the

358
00:24:12,498 --> 00:24:15,940
shortest possible time. So they will ask you, can you do it faster?

359
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,776
Aka, can you cut down your estimate? So how we

360
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,920
should approach to this issue, to this problem, how we should protect

361
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,050
our estimate from being but down.

362
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,648
So as I already said, I did a very deep research of a fortune

363
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:35,536
tellers before I started to prepare

364
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:39,110
this presentation. And as you can already see,

365
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,284
this might be a little bit funny that you will see this sentence

366
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:47,192
that your dog is not a cat, but that's what fortune tellers do,

367
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:51,224
actually. And the first advice from

368
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:54,792
my side is, when we are thinking

369
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:58,476
about protecting your estimate from being reduced, is to tell to

370
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:01,644
the people who cares trying to do this something that they already know,

371
00:25:01,842 --> 00:25:05,436
like, okay, but think about this. I know that you want

372
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:08,636
me to do this faster, but this is like a new project. We need the

373
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:12,272
time. We need to prepare everything. We need to

374
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:15,888
check the critical functionalities, we need to execute those tests. We have a

375
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:19,856
test plan which you already agreed on. And that's like pretty much it

376
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:23,684
takes time. I cannot make it faster. I need to do it

377
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:27,936
good. I need to do it in a proper way. I cannot make it shorter.

378
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:31,828
I cannot just speed the processing of the data

379
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:35,064
or my inputs and stuff like that. So tell them

380
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:38,408
something that they already know. Refer to the

381
00:25:38,574 --> 00:25:41,976
size of the project, refer to the risks of the

382
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:45,336
project, refer to the impact of the project on

383
00:25:45,358 --> 00:25:48,796
the existing system, refer to the importance of the

384
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:52,284
clients and stuff like that. There's a second thing

385
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:56,012
which you can do. You can add additional buffer which can be

386
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:59,596
cut down, and then it will lead to the situation when the person who is

387
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:03,216
managing the process will be happy because he was able to cut down the

388
00:26:03,238 --> 00:26:07,008
estimate a little bit. But this can be a little bit tricky and

389
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:10,800
pretty much it's not a very elegant way. The third thing

390
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:14,276
which you can do when you try to protect your estimate from

391
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:17,520
being reduced is ask for priorities.

392
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,476
So if someone will come to you and say, hey, we need

393
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:24,868
to make it faster, we need to finish testing faster because the deadline is there.

394
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:28,904
You can ask for priorities. You can say, okay, I can make

395
00:26:28,942 --> 00:26:32,296
it in a shorter time, but I won't be able to test everything which

396
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:36,168
I planned. So can you tell me what should be like the main focus

397
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:39,772
for me to meet this deadline? And I will try to do my best

398
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:43,196
and I will show you this in the testing report, that, well, based on

399
00:26:43,218 --> 00:26:46,924
your decision, I focused on this or that parts of the system

400
00:26:47,042 --> 00:26:50,956
and just do very basic checks on the other parts

401
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:56,624
of the system. So that's very good practice to do. So not

402
00:26:56,662 --> 00:27:00,380
only accept the decision that the test should last

403
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,720
a little bit shorter than original estimate,

404
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,096
but also ask for priorities. What should be my main goal

405
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,444
right now? If you are telling me so, which parts of my test plan

406
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:15,080
I can just have only in the basics and which

407
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,392
parts of my plan I should do in a normal way.

408
00:27:18,526 --> 00:27:22,180
And the fourth thing which you can do is use your own authority.

409
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,380
So if you previously

410
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,100
tested through a lot of deliveries for the project,

411
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,940
for the product which you are working on, you can use it as

412
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,620
your own authority and say, yeah, I know that this might seems

413
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,160
a little bit long, but think about this, I did this many of times,

414
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,808
I did a lot of projects for you, I did a lot of deliveries for

415
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:49,872
you, I tested a lot of deliveries and I never was off

416
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:53,652
with my estimate. So I know that it will

417
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:57,024
just take that much time. I cannot make it shorter.

418
00:27:57,072 --> 00:28:00,308
It's simple as that. It's just as it is.

419
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:04,504
And I know because I did it many, many times. So you can always use

420
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:07,976
your own authority for that. And I will

421
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:11,400
highly recommend this method because it will also

422
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,084
build your own image as a person who

423
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:18,844
knows what he's doing. So it's very important as

424
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:22,380
well. So to sum up everything

425
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,600
which we set up to this point, well, if you think about the test estimation,

426
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,492
it has two key factors. First of all, there are activities

427
00:28:30,556 --> 00:28:34,496
which are focused on the estimation itself. So you need

428
00:28:34,518 --> 00:28:38,064
to have an answer for the question, how much

429
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:41,796
time do I need for testing? How much time do I need to perform all

430
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:45,460
the activities, obviously including everything

431
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,884
which I already said, like the supporting activities, the things

432
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:52,660
which you cannot predict, the organization approach,

433
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,144
the testing, the stuff like all the things

434
00:28:57,182 --> 00:29:00,984
which are happening around, whether there are vacations, whether there are like

435
00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:05,064
c 19 or any other things which will influence

436
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:08,556
the estimation itself. So that's the first thing. But the

437
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:12,476
second thing, as much as important as

438
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:15,544
the test estimate, is to communicate the estimate.

439
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,832
You should answer yourself to the question who should know about it,

440
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:22,240
who should be notified about this and how to

441
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,884
monitor, how to update it, what to do with the estimation

442
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:29,524
when I already have it. So if you connect those

443
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:33,536
two things, I believe that this is the perfect recipe

444
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:37,444
for bringing the test estimation back into one

445
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:40,644
of the agenda of our activities, to make it,

446
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:44,468
again, a very important and to be perceived

447
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:48,280
as a very important activity in the QA

448
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,592
field. So in other words, if you

449
00:29:53,646 --> 00:29:57,080
want other people to know what you are actually dont

450
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,908
and how you cares going to do it and

451
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:04,492
what is like the key activities, what you are performing and to

452
00:30:04,546 --> 00:30:08,316
have the better understanding of your work as a QA, you should do

453
00:30:08,338 --> 00:30:11,724
the test estimation because it is one of the key activities

454
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,600
which will influence the entire process. Itself. So remember

455
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,684
about the test estimation, remember about the communicated and

456
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:23,700
joining those two together will give you a way better

457
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,152
life in a QA area. And that's

458
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:30,480
pretty much my approach on the test estimation.

459
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,880
