1
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,126
Everyone, welcome to the session talking about quantum s pad algorithms as

2
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:27,558
a means of harnessing quantum advantage in Niscara. So,

3
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:30,886
before going ahead with the session, I'd like to explain how

4
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:33,974
the whole session will be structured. So, there will be two components to the whole

5
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:37,762
session. One would be the presentation deck, and the other would be the notes deck.

6
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:41,462
The presentation deck would serve, as you can say, major bullet points or the main

7
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:44,826
points which I'll be covering in this whole session. And the

8
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:48,426
notes would contain an in detail explanation of the main points which I

9
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:51,578
talk about in the presentation. So the two things will go hand in hand,

10
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:55,002
and I think both of them will be provided to you after the whole session,

11
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:58,926
so you can go through both of them and use them as

12
00:00:58,948 --> 00:01:02,362
a computing material to each other. So without any further delay,

13
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:06,802
let's get started. So here we have the presentation deck. And today,

14
00:01:06,856 --> 00:01:10,386
as I mentioned, that we'll be talking about quantum and SpAd algorithms as a means

15
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:14,190
of harnessing quantum advantage in Nescara or quantum computing.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,006
So even before we get started with the whole presentation, it's important that I

17
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:21,686
talk about what Nescara is, because I'll be using this whole

18
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:24,898
chronology of Nescara a lot in this whole presentation.

19
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:28,978
So basically, Nisq, as we call it, is noise intermediate scale quantum,

20
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:32,630
or you would basically say and has of quantum computing,

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,626
in which the computers which we have right now, the hardware which we have right

22
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:39,750
now, are prone to error. They are not that much scalable,

23
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:44,030
and they have their own limitations. As we'll talk about going ahead with the presentation.

24
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,594
So the first thing is, again, always is the introduction

25
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:53,146
in which I'll emphasize why even we are talking about quantum computing

26
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:56,942
and what is the potential of quantum computing when we talk about solving

27
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:00,750
large scale problems, then I'll emphasize on limitations of quantum

28
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,466
current hardware. In sense, I'll talk more in detail about NisQ era of

29
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:07,646
quantum computing. Then we'll talk about some concepts

30
00:02:07,678 --> 00:02:11,714
of quantum mechanics that we particularly exploit when we are talking about quantum

31
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:15,826
inspired algorithms. And. Yeah, I think before further delay,

32
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:19,146
I will now I'll switch to the notes part of the whole presentation and we

33
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:20,060
can get started.

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,170
Yeah. So, as mentioned, even before we get started,

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,974
it's important to talk about why even are we talking about this whole.

36
00:02:30,032 --> 00:02:33,086
Why even are we having this session, to be very honest. Right. So that would

37
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:35,280
be the capacity of.

38
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,766
Yeah, give me a second. That would be the capacity of the

39
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:42,190
quantum computers.

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,300
Computers to solve complex problems.

41
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,866
So I think there already would have been a lot of sessions which will

42
00:02:52,888 --> 00:02:56,226
be particularly highlighting this aspect of quantum computing before you get to

43
00:02:56,248 --> 00:03:00,054
this session. But I'll try to keep it brief just so that, just for

44
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:03,314
context, so that we have the continuity of explanation.

45
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,030
So, see, in quantum computing, we have a concept called qubits,

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,754
right? And just to put it very, in a very abstract

47
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:14,266
sense, we know that the qubits, whenever we add one qubit to

48
00:03:14,288 --> 00:03:17,654
our, let's say we have some n qubits

49
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:21,100
here, like we have some n qubits which we are using to solve a problem.

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,726
Let's say the problem is px, right? So if I'm adding one

51
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:29,326
qubit to this whole system, I'm basically doubling my

52
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:33,066
computing capacity, or I'm doubling the potential of this system to solve

53
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:36,786
any kind of problem, right? That is how it goes. I think that

54
00:03:36,808 --> 00:03:40,734
is what you must have heard by now from previous presentations

55
00:03:40,782 --> 00:03:44,494
or by your own knowledge of this domain. So this is the core

56
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:47,606
concept, this is one of the core concept of why we even want to go

57
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,062
towards the quantum computing side. Some problems,

58
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:54,520
like you can say your traveling salesman problem,

59
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,066
your traveling salesman problem, and then you have problems like,

60
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,914
you can say topology optimization problem,

61
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:05,574
you have your genetic, you can say your usual combinatorial

62
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:09,610
optimization problem, I would say combinatorial optimization problem. So these problems

63
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,530
don't have a particular solution, right? So they work on an approximate algorithms.

64
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,846
So there's no better way to solve these problems rather than doing

65
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,334
it on a quantum computer. So this in some sense,

66
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:24,362
is where we see the potential of quantum computers

67
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:27,458
to be able to solve complex problems.

68
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:31,602
But again, now, this would be a sort of like a basic of why

69
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:35,186
even do we go towards the quantum computing side? I means I think I

70
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,626
didn't go much in depth for this particular section. And the reason for that being

71
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:42,726
that I think it would be already being covered by other sessions, because I

72
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:46,166
already saw the lineup. So they are like particular sessions which talk about exactly this

73
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:49,942
aspect of quantum computing. Now I'll come to the

74
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:52,762
more on the side of the things which actually rates sense,

75
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:56,250
which is actually important in sense of what we are trying to achieve here.

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,490
So that would be the limitations,

77
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,206
limitations of current

78
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:09,310
hardware.

79
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,940
Let me switch to a different pen.

80
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,488
See, the very first number, very first limitation is how we put it,

81
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:36,720
is scalability.

82
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,346
So whenever we are talking about quantum computers, right, whenever we are talking

83
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:48,670
about problem solving, any kind of problems. So an aspect of scalability is one

84
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,486
of the most important aspect, because let's be honest here, right, whenever you

85
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:55,686
are trying to solve an industrial case problem, the number

86
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,206
of variables or the number of potential candidates, which you have

87
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:03,062
to consider as a potential solution to a problem, they increase exponentially.

88
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:06,490
Right. Let's take a very simple example here. Like, say, I have to

89
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,974
say, just basically find this traveling salesman

90
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:13,534
problem, but instead of a city, I have to solve it for a whole

91
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:17,470
country, right? So it would make sense to you, right, that now the number of

92
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,674
possible solutions or the number of possible path that that salesman

93
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:25,786
can take, they increase exponentially. Right? So whenever, basically we're running

94
00:06:25,828 --> 00:06:29,314
one more point or one more possible endpoint or access point

95
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:32,786
to the whole TSP problem, we are potentially increasing. We are

96
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:36,174
doubling the number of possible candidates, right? So it's

97
00:06:36,222 --> 00:06:40,246
easy to see that. And scalability is an important aspect whenever we are

98
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:43,846
talking about any kind of problem. But that is

99
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,798
one of the major limitation of current hardware, because you

100
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:51,306
can see there are multiple architectures which we have in

101
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:54,650
our quantum computing domain right now. We have like,

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,060
annealing architecture. We'll talk about annealing in details later.

103
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,650
We have gate based architecture.

104
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,650
Gate based architecture.

105
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,050
You have your topological qubits,

106
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,814
logical qubits. So these

107
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:21,618
are some of the major architectures which we have in quantum computing.

108
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:25,542
All of them, they could be like superconducting qubits. You have

109
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:29,334
your diamond head qubits and your electron spin qubits. All of them are derivative

110
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:33,210
of this major architecture here. I'm talking about the architecture of hardware, not exactly

111
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,394
type of qubit which we use, right? So now, considering these

112
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,482
architectures, there are a certain hard

113
00:07:39,536 --> 00:07:43,246
limits or the number of qubits which we have available, right? And as

114
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:46,858
we'll proceed, we'll also talk about your quantum error correction

115
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,526
as a sort of like, what do you call, like extra weightage, which we need

116
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,806
to carry when we are never, we are trying to solve anything on a quantum

117
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:57,394
computer, right? So coming back to this.

118
00:07:57,432 --> 00:08:01,646
So scalability becomes an important aspect because, see, due to certain aspects

119
00:08:01,678 --> 00:08:06,342
like quantum error correction, we are already losing some qubits. So by

120
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:10,134
some chance, say we had total n qubits available as

121
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:14,178
given by any hardware vendor, hardware being the quantum hardware.

122
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:17,370
And out of these n capital n qubits,

123
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,266
some small n is usable, while some

124
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:26,070
small m would have to be reserved for certain aspects.

125
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,766
As we'll talk in detail has, we go ahead, like, there are aspects like quantum

126
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:33,486
error correction, ancillary qubits, support qubits. So those are

127
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:37,022
not usable qubits. So we are saying that even if we have

128
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:40,814
this capital n number of qubits, not every

129
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:44,574
qubit of every qubit is usable. That just means that we are further reducing

130
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:48,114
the scalability. And this value of capital n is already not that

131
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,620
large. We are talking about 120

132
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,238
usable qubits. That is like more or less the upper limit,

133
00:08:56,254 --> 00:08:59,766
which we have right now. And 120 possible qubits is not that much as,

134
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:02,758
I mean, you have to take my word for it, because if I go in

135
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:05,926
detail and you try to explain what different kind of

136
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:09,466
algorithms would require different kind of number of qubits, then it comes out to be

137
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:13,434
a large number. Any algorithms which you will develop right

138
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:17,830
now on quantum hardware or quantum architecture will have certain limits.

139
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,438
And those limits are very hard, and those limits do not scale well,

140
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:25,630
when we are talking about scaling the whole problem into something which

141
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,102
can be used directly in the industry. Right. The second

142
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:32,866
aspect, or let's say one of the second issues which we

143
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:36,530
have in the whole quantum computing thing, is noisy qubits.

144
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,686
Okay? So even if we say in the previously

145
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:48,390
I mentioned that say we have n qubits, right? But I said that

146
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,314
out of this n qubits, only small n are usable,

147
00:09:51,442 --> 00:09:55,442
right? But even the small n are not high quality qubit.

148
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:58,774
They are not usually. Okay, when I say

149
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:02,874
quality. So, see, when I use a qubit, like any

150
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,074
other thing or any other particle is just, what do you call,

151
00:10:06,112 --> 00:10:10,426
like, say, if this whole box was my quantum system,

152
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:15,054
then this qubit is a particle in that system, right? So in

153
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:19,006
ideal situation, we would want this particle to be able to retain its property

154
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:22,606
for lawless amount of time, right. We would want this particle to be able to

155
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:26,030
maintain its state, as we call it, in the quantum realm,

156
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,618
for the largest amount of time. But as I'll talk about that,

157
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:32,994
there are certain, you can say, losses, which occurs, right?

158
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,326
So this particle is not able

159
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:40,262
to maintain its state. So these, what we call are

160
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:43,654
known as noisy qubits, because over time, due to

161
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:48,214
decoheration interference or through outside interference

162
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:52,502
of material, they lose their potential

163
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:56,106
state, right. What would mean is that,

164
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:59,526
say, somehow, if this was a quantum

165
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:03,230
particle, this was a state of a qubit. Like this has some information

166
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,930
which is important, right? But if I were to leave this qubit,

167
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,546
even in an isolated system, isolated system here being a quantum

168
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:15,294
hardware or a quantum system, the state would be lost

169
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,860
over time, and this would actually release back,

170
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,954
come back to its original state, which is zero. Zero being your

171
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:25,494
usual qubit, zero or one. So this is usually called

172
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:30,086
decoherence. Decoherence. And what

173
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,822
this leads to is that this leads to loss of information.

174
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:36,666
So basically, you cannot rely on a

175
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:40,086
qubit to be able to maintain its state. And other aspect

176
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:43,626
to this whole noisy qubit thing is one would be, as I

177
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:46,410
mentioned, coherence.

178
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,986
Coherence. The other is the error

179
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:51,950
propagation.

180
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,590
Error propagation.

181
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,006
So what error propagation basically means is, I'll take an example, example of

182
00:12:03,028 --> 00:12:06,466
a gate based architecture. So in rates based architecture, what we

183
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:10,498
usually have is we have a qubit, which usually starts as zero

184
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:14,740
and it passes through gates. Whatever gate is X-Y-Z

185
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,374
Hadamard or whatever gate it is, it passes through the gates. So,

186
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:22,246
yeah, for this talk, I'm assuming that you have the basic understanding of

187
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:26,306
quantum computing. So that is something which sort of assumed

188
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:29,942
in the beginning. So again, this would be the x gate, and then

189
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:33,274
say we have some different gates, say y gate, and then we had some different

190
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:37,126
gates, h gate. So every time a qubit

191
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:40,666
passes through a gate in mathematical sense, it's very easy for us to

192
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:44,014
know, right? All of us at this point, if you have

193
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:48,094
read about basics of quantum computing, you already know that every

194
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:51,518
qubit is basically a matrix, right? Say I'm having a simple matrix of

195
00:12:51,524 --> 00:12:54,978
zero and one, if this is basically a one. So I mean, when I

196
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:58,706
say I pass it through a gate, I basically means that I multiply it

197
00:12:58,728 --> 00:13:02,114
with the matrix associated with that rates. In the rates based

198
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:03,860
architecture, at least, right?

199
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,406
We get some solution state, and which is the state at the end of this

200
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:13,794
whole, let's say this whole socket,

201
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:17,382
right? But in actuality, in actual physical terms, in hardware term,

202
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:20,806
we know that we use different possible principles.

203
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:24,490
Like we use microwaves, we use certain,

204
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,150
what do you call photonic radiations, right? And we use certain aspect,

205
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,310
certain actual physical, physical properties of

206
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,274
these particles to store the state of the particle,

207
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:38,766
basically to change it, like to modulate it, right? So basically what

208
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:42,634
we are saying is that after, say, if I started with psi

209
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:46,146
one, wait, just give

210
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:49,780
me a second. Yeah. So if I started with

211
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,414
psi one state, so what I'm saying that after passing it to every gate,

212
00:13:54,462 --> 00:13:58,162
I'm changing it to some state, psi two, and I'm changing it to same state,

213
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:02,246
psi three, right. And so on. But in the course of this action, because I

214
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:05,240
said that the qubit, which we have right now are not of high quality,

215
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,894
we sort of lose some data, we lose some state of that

216
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:13,466
particle. So some error gets propagated, like say some e

217
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:16,746
one error is propagated the first time we pass it through a gate. Some e

218
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:20,378
two error is propagated the second time we pass it through a gate. And basically

219
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:23,614
this, and goes on. So basically what happens is that now this e two

220
00:14:23,652 --> 00:14:27,294
component will be a sum of e one plus sum plus e two.

221
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,442
Basically the error of the previous gate plus the error of this gate.

222
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:34,034
So what I'm trying to imply here is that there's a propagation of error as

223
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:37,134
we go on to pass the qubit to gates.

224
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:41,154
What this means, and what this actually means in terms of consequences sense, is that

225
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:45,142
we have a limit to

226
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:48,870
the number of rates, number of gates,

227
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,438
or circuit depth, as we call it in

228
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:58,066
quantum computing. So the circuit depth is limited, and limitation

229
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:01,942
of the circuit depth would mean that you cannot apply certain algorithms

230
00:15:02,006 --> 00:15:06,090
because certain algorithms require huge

231
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,722
sockets for larger number of qubits. Because,

232
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,878
see, usually one thing which I think you

233
00:15:12,884 --> 00:15:16,318
got out of intuition is whenever we are talking about scalability aspect, we are

234
00:15:16,324 --> 00:15:18,670
basically talking about number of qubits.

235
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,498
But it's also important to understand that when you increase the number of qubit,

236
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:26,914
you are in some sense also increasing the circuit depth because

237
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:30,542
more qubits require more gates, right? I mean, in sense of the circuit depth.

238
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:33,950
So circuit depth and number of qubits both becomes an equal

239
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,730
problem when you're talking about the scalability aspect of current hardware.

240
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,986
Okay, then I'm talking about errors,

241
00:15:42,018 --> 00:15:45,430
right? So it's important to know that there are error correction code,

242
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,938
quantum error correction code, or QEC, as we

243
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:52,780
call in short terms. But these error correcting code,

244
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,382
error correcting codes right now are not of high

245
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:05,514
quality. This is something of a very high research priority right

246
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:09,206
now. There's a lot of research being done in this exact domain.

247
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:13,206
But again, what does this mean in physical sense? Right? So in physical

248
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,034
sense, it means that even if we are able to get capital n user

249
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:20,394
qubits, we will only be able to use small n number of qubits,

250
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:24,286
because we will have to give this some m qubits for

251
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:27,790
these quantum error correction codes. This m can sometimes

252
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,678
be large if you really want a good higher fidelity

253
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,642
results, right. Then you'll have to make this m large,

254
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:38,098
which would mean that this small n would be small. So basically you'll be

255
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:41,286
limited by the number of usable qubits which you have for solving any kind of

256
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:45,160
problem. So this becomes an issue. And again,

257
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,398
you can say this is more on the, these were like the major ones,

258
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:52,746
which have actually have physical implications, but there

259
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:56,730
are other smaller aspects as well. You're talking about calibration issues,

260
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:05,222
right? How do you calibrate calibration

261
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:08,846
issues? Like how do you calibrate these qubits? That's again, that becomes an issue.

262
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:12,110
And then you're also talking about the variability as a factor.

263
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,466
The thing is that, as I stated, in ideal world,

264
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,860
all the qubits should behave identically. Right?

265
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,226
But in physical sense, it's important to understand that. And qubit is

266
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:28,030
basically a particle, right? That follows certain principles,

267
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,838
as you must have heard, just for context, that any qubit is any kind of

268
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:36,454
particle that has two possible end states, which being zero or

269
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:39,206
one. We are just naming it zero one. It could be anything. It could be

270
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:42,534
plus, it could be minus, as you must have heard. So we have different

271
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:45,926
bases, right? This is the computational rates. We have the planar

272
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:49,770
bases. We have the polar base. There are different kind of bases, which we have.

273
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,318
But any particle which has two possible end states and has

274
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:56,714
a possibility of being existing in a state, say psi,

275
00:17:56,842 --> 00:18:00,222
such that it could be a combination of both. Sorry.

276
00:18:00,276 --> 00:18:03,630
Zero plus beta one is basically

277
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,130
a qubit. So, qubit is a concept. It's not actually a physical thing.

278
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,134
And physical particle can behave like a qubit, so that physical particle,

279
00:18:11,182 --> 00:18:14,818
again, will have its own limitations. But how do we ensure that?

280
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:18,962
Say we have different particles, but all those particles behave exactly

281
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:22,078
the same? Because I can assure you that. Okay,

282
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:25,526
I tell you that, okay, this particle is a qubit. And I'll tell

283
00:18:25,548 --> 00:18:28,962
you. Okay, basically, this p one particle, I tell you, is a qubit,

284
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,326
and this p two particle also behaves like a qubit. But how do

285
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:35,926
I make sure that these two are calibrated? They don't

286
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:39,958
show any kind of variability. Right. That, again, becomes an circumstance,

287
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:42,746
sort of like an issue on the hardware side of things, to be honest.

288
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:46,934
Like, this doesn't have a lot of limitation directly,

289
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:50,846
but it becomes an issue when you're talking about from a more in

290
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,960
depth hardware perspective. Right?

291
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:59,106
Again, one of the other important issue which you'll face when

292
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:01,730
you talk about limitation is qubit connectivity.

293
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,006
This is one of the issues which you won't directly have

294
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:12,546
issues with. This won't become an issue to you, like in the

295
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,014
initial phases of, what do you call your planning, your algorithm.

296
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:19,570
But it becomes an issue later. So what happens is that, see, because,

297
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,586
as I said, every quantum hardware is basically a quantum

298
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:26,870
system. So if I say that I had qubits,

299
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,826
I told you, right, every particle, a qubit

300
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:35,162
is basically a particle that follows certain principles. So,

301
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,954
say these are the particles. And I have already proved by

302
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:43,306
some physics method or physical method, that they

303
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:46,058
fulfill the properties of a qubit. Okay? So,

304
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,658
now, given that this system, this is a closed system. So this is a closed

305
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:52,766
system. Now, I already stated that

306
00:19:52,788 --> 00:19:55,866
this system is already existing quantum hardware.

307
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,560
But the issue becomes here is that, see,

308
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,394
there is a limitation of the connectivity between the qubits.

309
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:06,306
Like say this is the kind of connectivity which we follow

310
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:09,746
and say this is connected to this and this is connected to this. So this

311
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:12,822
is the kind of connectivity which we have. I think if you're interested in this,

312
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:16,866
you can just Google connectivity graph of any, say quantum

313
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:20,146
hardware, famous being the IBM basic. The IBM

314
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:23,814
provides the quantum topography. Or you can say this particular

315
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:27,550
connectivity map of all their hardware. So you can go look it up. So let's

316
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,366
say this was some quantum hardware, q one. This is the connectivity

317
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,618
map of that hardware. So this is particle p one and this is a

318
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:38,218
particle p two. So let's particle, this is

319
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:41,934
particle p three. So you can easily see that there is a direct path from

320
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:45,934
p one to p three. So now, okay, now I'm trying to say run three

321
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:49,534
qubit algorithm. So I am basically taking p one,

322
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:53,266
p two and p three. And all of them start with

323
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:56,530
zero. Because initialize, we initialize it with zero.

324
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,938
So it's easy to see that. Okay, now say I have to

325
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:02,918
use a c zero gate, right, which is a two qubit gate. And I want

326
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:07,026
to make the control qubit at p one and basically the not gate

327
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,160
at p two. It's easy to see that.

328
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,214
Let's make it p three and this would be p two.

329
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:17,802
Yeah. So it's easy to see here that if I want to perform this simple

330
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:21,354
operation, it is possible, as my connectivity map tells me,

331
00:21:21,392 --> 00:21:24,906
that there is a direct connection between p one and p three. Particular p

332
00:21:24,928 --> 00:21:28,682
three qubit. Right? But what if I now need to form

333
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:32,174
a c zero gate between p one and p two, p one

334
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,886
and p two. It's easy to see that there is no direct path between the

335
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:39,194
two. I mean, I'll have to connect. Basically there is a path,

336
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:42,750
I mean there's a path, but it goes to p three and say p four

337
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,162
and p five and p six and so on. Right? But there is no direct

338
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:49,666
path. There is no one step path from p one and p two. So p

339
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:52,894
one and p two are not directly connected. This becomes a limitation.

340
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,140
Okay. I mean, there are ways to do it, right?

341
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,398
If I didn't tell you. So this is not even if I want to,

342
00:21:59,404 --> 00:22:02,600
this operation, it's not a wrong operation. It is possible.

343
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,434
We basically use swap rates now. So what basically swap gate is just for

344
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:11,046
context is in simple notation term,

345
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:14,970
we just represent it through two x's. This is basically

346
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,506
a swap rates, but in actuality a sortnet

347
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,866
swap gate. Is basically three c zero gates. So it's

348
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:27,360
like this and

349
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,266
this. So you can basically swap gate has a whole

350
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:35,806
matrix associated with it. And if you try, if you multiply the matrices

351
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:39,566
for three c zero gate, tensor product them, you also get the same matrix.

352
00:22:39,678 --> 00:22:43,374
So basically, in theory,

353
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,918
we just use this notation. But in hardware sense, this is what happens in the

354
00:22:46,924 --> 00:22:50,422
background. What this swap actually

355
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:54,150
means is now, if I want to go from p one to p two,

356
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,654
I'll basically be swapping this p three with p four and swapping this p

357
00:22:57,692 --> 00:23:01,002
four with this p five and p five with p six and so on until

358
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:04,330
I'm able to swap p two with p three. So basically,

359
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,786
I'll swap this gate with this, right? So it's easy to say

360
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:11,870
here that what I'm saying right now is that for every swap, I'm basically

361
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,326
adding three c zero gates, and every c zero rates is

362
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:19,246
basically two single qubit gates, right? One is control and one

363
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:21,954
is c zero. One is the not gate. So basically, what I'm saying is,

364
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:25,390
for every step, I'm having six gates

365
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,122
more to the circuit. So for this kind of operation, let's say,

366
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:33,094
which we had 1234-5678

367
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,454
so it's basically eight into six, like 48

368
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:40,002
gates just to do a single operation, single operation,

369
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:43,766
single logical operation. But 48 physical operations needed to be

370
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:47,206
done in order to do that, right? So it's easy to see that this affects

371
00:23:47,238 --> 00:23:51,034
the whole scalability aspect of our hardware. So again,

372
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:54,938
connectivity becomes an issue when you're talking about the

373
00:23:54,944 --> 00:23:58,746
broad and broader sense, the limitation of niscara devices. So these were

374
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:02,346
some of the major limitations of, you can say, your niscara

375
00:24:02,378 --> 00:24:06,014
devices and why even we are considering these are

376
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:09,594
some factors, why we do not basically run all the algorithms

377
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:13,326
which we have right now on quantum hardware. These are the things which are stopping

378
00:24:13,358 --> 00:24:16,660
us. These are major research points. I'll be honest with you.

379
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,354
I'll not say that this is something which will affect us for a longer time.

380
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:23,570
Like, people are diligently working on these things, particularly to

381
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,366
improve the state of the current hardware. But this is what

382
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:30,198
I say, what is what I mean when I say that we are in sort

383
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:33,486
of like a Nisq era of quantum computing, where we are limited

384
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:37,562
by the current hardware. So just last

385
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:41,002
put it, I talked about

386
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:44,858
Nisq. So now I think every point, every single

387
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:48,046
wording of this whole abbreviation should make sense to you,

388
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:51,786
right? Nisq, noisy. We talked about noisy

389
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:55,658
qubit intermediate, because we are in an intermediate

390
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:59,454
stage right now scale, because the scalability is a huge

391
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:02,758
issue right now. Mean we do not have scalable hardware,

392
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:06,146
quantum, because again, we are talking about quantum hardware. So why

393
00:25:06,168 --> 00:25:09,234
not? So this list should make sense to you.

394
00:25:09,432 --> 00:25:12,754
I spend a lot of time on this because it's important that you understand

395
00:25:12,952 --> 00:25:16,614
what are the limitations. Why are we even talking about this? Why are we having

396
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:20,422
this session? Why are we even talking about quantum has bad algorithms when we already

397
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:24,154
have algorithms for quantum hardware? So now

398
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:27,046
comes now, coming to the main subject,

399
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:36,730
quantum s pad algorithms.

400
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,290
Algorithms.

401
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:44,314
Okay, so what are quantum AspAd algorithms?

402
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,534
So, let's go with the wording. First, we have

403
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:50,874
quantum again, which would means quantum mechanics principles.

404
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:55,040
Inspired, meaning that we are inspired by the principles. We are not exactly.

405
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,980
We are not able to simulate them in some sense. Sorry,

406
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,598
we don't have that hardware of that kind. We are not doing it exactly on

407
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:06,742
a quantum mechanics realm. Right. But we are simulating those

408
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:10,194
properties. So inspired would means that we are limitations simulating

409
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:14,642
those properties. Simulating and algorithms,

410
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:18,266
again, is a series of steps. So, basically, when we

411
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:22,154
say quantum has bad algorithms, we are talking about the algorithms which simulate some

412
00:26:22,192 --> 00:26:25,714
quantum mechanics principles to get performance benefit.

413
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:29,406
I mean, it wouldn't make sense, right, if you don't get any kind

414
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:34,110
of performance benefit. So we are talking about some performance

415
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,180
benefits that go along with the algorithms. So,

416
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,580
coming back to the presentation now,

417
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,586
so, again, we talked about, in an introduction, we talked about the

418
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:50,514
potential of quantum computing to solve complex problems.

419
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:53,398
We talked about niscara, basically, the whole Nisq thing,

420
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:56,194
and we introduced the concepts.

421
00:26:56,242 --> 00:27:00,040
Now we'll go in detail in the whole concept thing.

422
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,890
Again, this is something which we have already covered, basically, understanding the

423
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,530
niscara of quantum computing. It's important to understand the challenges and

424
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,940
the limitations which we face with the current hardware. And again,

425
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,950
we could talk about, you can see basically the third point, which means

426
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,614
leveraging the use of quantum AsPAD algorithms to still get some

427
00:27:23,652 --> 00:27:27,566
advantage, but not exactly be limited by the hardware of

428
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:31,106
current time. As you will see, that basically, what, when we say, when we talk

429
00:27:31,128 --> 00:27:34,498
about quantum aspired algorithms, which we

430
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:37,906
are basically saying, as I stated, that we are simulating the properties of

431
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:41,666
quantum computer, we are simulating some quantum mechanics principles. Those principles

432
00:27:41,698 --> 00:27:44,418
I'll talk about in the next few seconds.

433
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:47,894
So, those simulating certain properties of quantum computing to

434
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,446
get benefit. Right. So, this simulation happens from

435
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:54,662
classical hardware and by lot of work

436
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,106
done by our ancestors. Classical hardware is at its

437
00:27:58,128 --> 00:28:01,546
very best right now, in some sense. We do have great hardware. We have

438
00:28:01,568 --> 00:28:05,050
gpus, we have cpus, we have GPU, CPU, collaborations. Right.

439
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,566
So we have hardware that is classical hardware that can scale.

440
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:12,014
Again, one thing which I would particularly point

441
00:28:12,052 --> 00:28:16,026
out in no sense, by simulating the property of quantum

442
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:20,298
mechanics, will we be able to get the whole benefit or the full potential.

443
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:23,934
We won't be able to achieve the full potential that these algorithms

444
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:27,086
have. These algorithms are basically, in the end, are meant

445
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:30,546
to run on a quantum hardware. But because the hardware is still in

446
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:34,114
the budding stage, we are just simulating them on a classical

447
00:28:34,162 --> 00:28:37,062
hardware and still getting some performance benefit. So,

448
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:40,818
basically, the thing of essence here is that scalability

449
00:28:40,914 --> 00:28:44,326
is possible on classical hardware, even if we are

450
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:47,686
not exactly gift. It's like you can select a trough, has sort of a trade

451
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:51,398
off. On a real quantum hardware. We expect huge performance bonus,

452
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:54,806
but scalability is an issue. But in quantum inspired, the trade

453
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:58,470
off is that performance might not be that big as compared to a

454
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,158
pure quantum hardware, but the scalability is there. We are

455
00:29:02,244 --> 00:29:05,854
potentially able to scale them in order to solve, you can say,

456
00:29:05,972 --> 00:29:09,854
industrial problems. So that is where the essence of quantum inspired comes into

457
00:29:09,892 --> 00:29:13,662
play. Okay, again, we have talked about what quantum inspired algorithms

458
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:16,798
are. I sort of talked about the motivation.

459
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:20,734
Why even are we considering quantum inspired? We are considering quantum inspired

460
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:23,880
for its scalability aspect and still being able to

461
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,920
deliver some performance benefit. Because, again,

462
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,342
we are here because some kind of performance benefit is what actually

463
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,430
a performance boost is actually what we are behind. So,

464
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,966
again, now I'll talk about the properties.

465
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:42,906
I've always been saying that we use certain properties of quantum mechanics and this

466
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:45,900
and that. What exact properties am I talking about?

467
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,240
The very first is parallelism, or means,

468
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,850
as I like to call it, parallelism or superposition.

469
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,380
Superposition. So even before getting, or getting in

470
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,346
exact, detailed discussion of his concept, I'll take

471
00:30:11,368 --> 00:30:14,774
a very simple example. So let's say I have a coin, right?

472
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:18,534
And for any coin, we have two possible end states,

473
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:22,246
heads and tails. Now, let's say that this is a

474
00:30:22,268 --> 00:30:25,814
qubit. For the sake of this discussion, I'll assume that

475
00:30:25,852 --> 00:30:28,346
say this, my coin is a qubit. Now,

476
00:30:28,528 --> 00:30:31,866
whenever I flip this coin and

477
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:34,746
I say it falls into my wrist, right? It falls into my wrist. And now

478
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:38,490
I close my wrist. So until I open my wrist,

479
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,154
there is a 50%. I means this, heads and tails.

480
00:30:42,202 --> 00:30:46,142
There's a 50% chance that it could be has. And there's a 50%

481
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:48,714
chance that it could either be tails.

482
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:52,526
Right? So we can say this particular coin right

483
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:55,858
now is in a parallel position. It is a parallelism, is in a state of

484
00:30:55,864 --> 00:30:59,538
parallelism. It's in a state of superposition, it's equally likely to

485
00:30:59,544 --> 00:31:03,298
be heads. It's equally likely to be tails. Or if, for the sake

486
00:31:03,314 --> 00:31:07,030
of consideration, as I previously mentioned, that I'm considering,

487
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,640
this coin is basically a qubit. And we know that

488
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,930
I talked in very slight details that any

489
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,178
qubit, basically, should follow this principle. That it should be

490
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:24,058
able to have a state which should be defined with

491
00:31:24,064 --> 00:31:27,854
the help of this alpha and beta component, which I think

492
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:31,182
you guys should know that the square of this alpha and the square

493
00:31:31,236 --> 00:31:35,518
of this beta is basically the probability of

494
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:39,182
this particular state, psi, after measurement, to either

495
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:42,922
gives heads or to either give tails.

496
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:46,526
Right? So, I mean, this is some basic understanding,

497
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,046
which, as previously mentioned, I'm sort of assuming

498
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:54,238
that you guys have this kind of understanding. If you don't, don't worry,

499
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:57,446
you can just record this. You can just pause this session and you can go

500
00:31:57,468 --> 00:32:00,898
back and just type introduction to quantum computing.

501
00:32:00,994 --> 00:32:04,374
You might even find some of my videos back there. But,

502
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:07,126
yeah, my point here being that say, okay, now, the sake of this. Coming back

503
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:10,538
to this discussion, for the sake of discussion, as I said, I'm assuming that the

504
00:32:10,544 --> 00:32:14,214
coin is sort of like a qubit. So in theory,

505
00:32:14,262 --> 00:32:18,166
it should follow this principle as well. Right? This coin

506
00:32:18,198 --> 00:32:21,582
should also have a state, right? And as a state, and as I previously mentioned,

507
00:32:21,636 --> 00:32:24,926
that a coin has two possible end states, heads or tails. So,

508
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:28,126
basically, the state of a coin should be. We should be able to define it

509
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:31,342
in this sense as alpha heads plus beta tails.

510
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:35,070
Where the square of alpha and the square of beta defines the probability

511
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:38,606
of the coin being either heads or tails, respectively.

512
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:42,194
So, because as I previously, in our case,

513
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:46,162
I'm saying that the coin is in my fist,

514
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:49,110
right? And my fist is closed.

515
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,174
So by common sense, we can say the value of this

516
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:57,130
alpha and this beta with a square of these values

517
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,842
are both zero five. Right?

518
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,322
Because, as I said, I mean, right now it's in a 50 50 state,

519
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:06,874
right? So it's zero five, right? Square. I mean,

520
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:10,310
the value of the square is zero five. Mean the actual value would be somewhere

521
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,094
along one by under root two. Right? Because one by under root two, the square

522
00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:17,358
would be one by two, which would be 0.5. So basically,

523
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:20,946
alpha and beta, to be precise, would be one by

524
00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:25,266
under root two. And the square of these values is one by two.

525
00:33:25,448 --> 00:33:28,420
Or 0.5 or 50%.

526
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,258
Right. This is what we call superposition. Now,

527
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,414
how exactly does this come into play? In actual, you can say,

528
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:39,046
quantum computing aspect. So what happens is that. See, okay, now, there were

529
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:42,278
only two possible states. But now,

530
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:45,882
in some sense, I'm saying that this one single

531
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:49,674
coin, c one which has a state, psi one,

532
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:53,622
when it is in the wrist, right. It is a combination

533
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:57,406
of heads and tails. Or basically, it is a computational of two

534
00:33:57,428 --> 00:34:01,114
states existing simultaneously until we open the wrist.

535
00:34:01,242 --> 00:34:05,258
So, just for context, the opening

536
00:34:05,354 --> 00:34:09,550
my fist. Opening fist,

537
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,830
basically, is what we call measurement,

538
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,806
which, again, is, again, is a concept which you

539
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:21,618
must have heard when you were studying introduction to quantum computing.

540
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:25,014
So, basically, measurement is at the end. Measurement is nothing.

541
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:29,218
But after I open my wrist, it should always be either heads

542
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:32,822
and tails. After I open my wrist, it cannot be in that in between

543
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:36,106
state. Right? Now, it has to decide. Now, it has to either be

544
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:39,690
heads. It has to either be tails. So at

545
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,218
end, that finite, that discrete state

546
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:47,802
which the whole state, which the quantum particle has to fall

547
00:34:47,856 --> 00:34:51,066
into, this is in some sense called measurement. I mean, measurement in actuality

548
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:54,926
is a bit complex. It's just a complex concept. But if

549
00:34:54,948 --> 00:34:57,806
I talk about it, then I have to talk about a computational basis and then

550
00:34:57,908 --> 00:35:01,614
talk about how exactly the best example

551
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:05,054
I can give a measurement is like you're talking this cat, the whole

552
00:35:05,092 --> 00:35:08,458
experiment. Until you open the box, the cat is both dead

553
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:12,006
and alive, right? But has you open it and you observe the

554
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:15,426
particle, you observe the cat. It has to either be dead or be alive.

555
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,530
Then it cannot be in a state in between. Right? Exactly. Like a coin.

556
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,346
As soon as I open my wrist, as soon as I observe my coin.

557
00:35:21,378 --> 00:35:24,390
Now, it has to be either heads or it has to be tails. Exactly.

558
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,702
Now, in actual theories, in qubit, which has two possible states,

559
00:35:27,756 --> 00:35:31,114
like zero or one, as soon as I perform the measurement, or I observe that

560
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:34,666
particle, it has to be either one or zero. Now, it cannot be in that

561
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:38,094
in between state. But in quantum computing, what we do is we

562
00:35:38,132 --> 00:35:41,966
take benefit of the

563
00:35:41,988 --> 00:35:46,506
principle or the possibility of this particle

564
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:49,742
to exist in state of in between, say,

565
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:53,370
zero and one, we take the advantage of this while it's

566
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,278
still in superposition. And what we do is like, see, this I'm

567
00:35:57,294 --> 00:36:01,138
talking about in pure quantum computing sense right now. So what we do is we

568
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:04,902
modulate this values of alphas and betas. And by

569
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:08,854
doing that, we are basically modulating the final result, which we'll get when

570
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:12,754
we perform measurement of this psi,

571
00:36:12,802 --> 00:36:16,034
of this state. So, let's, for the sake of convenience,

572
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:19,180
like, very simple example, if we had a black box,

573
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,346
and we need to find the solution. This black box is basically a function f

574
00:36:24,368 --> 00:36:27,738
x. And we need to find the minimum of this black box or

575
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:31,194
minima of this function, right? And for the sake of this convenience,

576
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:33,280
let's say that the minima was zero,

577
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,214
right? Basically the value of x being zero is what

578
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:41,098
gives the minimum value of this function, f x. The sake of this convenience.

579
00:36:41,194 --> 00:36:44,766
And we are using only one qubit. We are using only one qubit,

580
00:36:44,798 --> 00:36:49,154
says zero. So this right now is in a state where alpha is one

581
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:52,120
and beta is zero, right.

582
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,598
I should just make it one. I think it would be better. So it

583
00:36:56,604 --> 00:36:59,974
would be alpha is zero and beta is one. Right.

584
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:04,598
For the particle, following basically

585
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,394
this whole aspect. So now that

586
00:37:08,432 --> 00:37:11,978
we know this, now we know that the solution in our case,

587
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:16,174
for the sake of has convenience, we know that at the end the alpha should

588
00:37:16,212 --> 00:37:20,014
become one and beta should become zero for the

589
00:37:20,052 --> 00:37:23,662
particle after measurement to give this discrete value zero.

590
00:37:23,796 --> 00:37:27,274
Right? Now, as an algorithm

591
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:30,574
designer, in this case, we know what we need to do.

592
00:37:30,612 --> 00:37:34,146
But usually we have a fitness function which tells us how close we

593
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:36,978
are to a solution. We have some function, let's say we have some finite function

594
00:37:37,064 --> 00:37:39,390
which tells it how close we are to the solution,

595
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,898
okay? Or some methodology by which we keep telling the

596
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:46,566
algorithm that, okay, you are approaching to the solution, you are getting farther from

597
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:50,134
the solution. So make changes accordingly. So let's say that here,

598
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:52,950
because we already know, and we are an observer, so we know we need to,

599
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,266
at the end, make this alpha to be one. So now what I'll do

600
00:37:56,288 --> 00:38:00,022
is I'll make an algorithm, the particle.

601
00:38:00,086 --> 00:38:03,622
After, let's say I'm using an Hadamad gate,

602
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:07,958
after I put it into a superposition, I'll now perform certain operation

603
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:11,914
which will make sure that after those operation, this alpha

604
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:15,200
falls into alpha becomes one and beta becomes zero.

605
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,374
In this case, because we had one qubit. So there was no sense of using

606
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:22,462
parallelism. But now let's say we had n qubits.

607
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:25,326
So now when we are talking about using n qubits,

608
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:29,460
we are basically talking about two to three n potential states

609
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,826
existing simultaneously. When the n was one, basically we had

610
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:37,430
two states existing simultaneously, right? Which was zero and one.

611
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,806
So we were basically checking the values of zero and one both for the

612
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:44,486
black box, right? And we saw after, because now in this case we

613
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:47,578
already know. Like we just saw that, okay, this has to be zero.

614
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:51,146
So we make alpha one. But let's just say

615
00:38:51,168 --> 00:38:54,906
we did not know that. So now in some sense, we are basically using the

616
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:58,090
two values simultaneously for checking the value of the black box.

617
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,026
This is exactly what happens in dutch algorithm or Dutch Zosk algorithms.

618
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:05,386
If you're taking multiple qubits and for single qubit, it's called dutch

619
00:39:05,418 --> 00:39:08,510
algorithms. So you can look it up. I mean,

620
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,030
it's a pure quantum algorithm. It's dutch

621
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,190
algorithm.

622
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,466
Okay. This is once, in some

623
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:24,786
sense, what supervision is. So, superlation is basically using two

624
00:39:24,808 --> 00:39:28,182
to the power n possible states simultaneously for a given function,

625
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:31,318
f x, to find whether. Which of them is the closer to

626
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:34,906
the solution or which of them is a solution sometimes. So that would be

627
00:39:35,008 --> 00:39:39,014
even the Grover search algorithm takes advantage of this, which is comparatively

628
00:39:39,062 --> 00:39:43,130
a bit popular algorithm. So that also takes advantage of quantum superposition.

629
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,530
Again, now, this principle is, we can say one of the most important

630
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,746
principle which we make use in quantum has bad algorithms.

631
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:54,286
So if you talk about. I'm talking from

632
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,982
a very simulation sense here, what we are basically doing is we are

633
00:39:58,036 --> 00:40:01,202
changing this alpha and beta parameters, right? For any

634
00:40:01,256 --> 00:40:04,494
particular particle,

635
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:07,774
we are just a state, or say we have the particle psi

636
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,266
one. These are a function of these two particles, alpha and

637
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:15,302
beta. So if you modulate this alpha and beta, in some sense,

638
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:19,526
we can simulate this quantum property. Right? So initially, what this

639
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:23,126
mean is that initially put it something random and over time, keep on

640
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:26,586
modulating the properties of alphas and betas and accordance to the closer you

641
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:30,202
reach to the solution state. So this is, in some sense,

642
00:40:30,256 --> 00:40:33,446
how we simulate quantum parallelism in quantum inspired

643
00:40:33,478 --> 00:40:36,560
algorithms. And this is some sort of like an important

644
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:41,200
concept. And again, the second concept, which we usually have

645
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:46,010
in quantum inspired realm.

646
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,520
Let me just change my color.

647
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,050
Yeah. Quantum tunneling,

648
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,826
this is more. If quantum superposition was more

649
00:40:57,848 --> 00:41:01,234
on the general concept. Quantum tunneling is more

650
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:04,690
prone or focused towards your quantum annealing concepts.

651
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:09,106
Your quantum annealing is basically, as I previously mentioned, is a type of architecture

652
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:10,280
which we use,

653
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,366
I think annealing in general, I think you do have an idea, right? Annealing is

654
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:18,506
basically like, over time. Like if you heat a metal, over time,

655
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:21,846
it cools down, right? So every particle in this whole universe

656
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:25,020
has a tendency to be in a minimum state of energy. So if I draw

657
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:29,134
the energy versus time graph, if I draw this,

658
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:32,746
so every particle will eventually reach that state of global

659
00:41:32,778 --> 00:41:36,862
minimum or global minimum energy, right? That's a property. So they will

660
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:40,274
basically utilize this property to, what do you call,

661
00:41:40,312 --> 00:41:44,078
like, simulate, to basically find the minima, global minima

662
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:47,746
of certain functions. Right? Fx. So basically, when I say

663
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:52,230
Fx, it doesn't mean that this is only limited to your function optimization.

664
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,038
In theory, it said that any kind of problem which

665
00:41:56,044 --> 00:41:59,462
you are trying to solve, it is always possible

666
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:03,110
to map that problem onto a function. And so

667
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,586
every problem, in the end just becomes an optimization problem if you think

668
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:10,026
about it, right? So this Fxfx is basically the problem which we

669
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:13,846
are trying to solve. Okay? Now, let's say the landscape

670
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:18,140
of this function f x over x

671
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,020
is, say, along this line,

672
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,078
it changes like this, right? So as I said, annealing works on a

673
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,400
simple concept, classical annealing, I'm talking about.

674
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,086
It will keep going down. It will keep going down until it reaches

675
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:36,626
this point. Let's just give me a second. Okay, this was how it

676
00:42:36,648 --> 00:42:39,810
was. But you can see that this is a local minima,

677
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,438
and this right here is the global minimum.

678
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:47,118
Right? Now, here is a limitation of classical leveraging.

679
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:51,046
Now, if it needs to reach this global minimum, it also needs to go

680
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,058
over this whole steep hill, right?

681
00:42:54,144 --> 00:42:57,850
Until it reaches again this valley of this whole,

682
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,810
you can say landscape, right?

683
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,410
But here, whereas classical would

684
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,162
depend on randomness or would depend on sort of like a miracle

685
00:43:08,246 --> 00:43:11,546
to just cross this whole trope.

686
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:15,018
And in quantum, we have a concept of tunneling.

687
00:43:15,194 --> 00:43:18,686
What exactly is tunneling? I'll give you a brief about it. So what happens is

688
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:22,126
that, okay, this is, interestingly enough, quantum tunneling

689
00:43:22,158 --> 00:43:26,100
was discovered while we're trying to improve a classical hardware. So what happens is,

690
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,222
has, per Moore's law, you already know that the number of transistors

691
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:34,606
which we have on an integrated circuit doubles every decade,

692
00:43:34,718 --> 00:43:38,226
every three to four years, right? So that means if you're doubling

693
00:43:38,258 --> 00:43:40,934
the number of transistors, that would be. There are two ways of doing it,

694
00:43:40,972 --> 00:43:44,914
right? Make the integrate IC chip larger or make the transistor

695
00:43:44,962 --> 00:43:48,678
smaller, right. So again, it's obviously not possible to make the IC larger

696
00:43:48,694 --> 00:43:52,714
because we want our devices to be smaller, not bigger, right? So we

697
00:43:52,752 --> 00:43:55,946
make our transistor smaller. So, see, again, there is a

698
00:43:55,968 --> 00:43:59,374
limit to which we can reduce the size of a transistor. After a certain

699
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:03,230
limit, the quantum mechanics principles comes into play, and they start interfering with

700
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,214
our results, and we don't get the idealistic results. So when

701
00:44:07,252 --> 00:44:10,926
that happens, the scientists started to notice that there is this

702
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:14,482
phenomenon which happens of quantum tunneling, that the transistors become

703
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:18,238
so small that electrons just passes through them and they don't

704
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:21,766
have to interact with them, they just pass through them. So this is what they

705
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:26,406
call tunneling. So in our respect, what happens is that in

706
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:33,126
quantum annealing, there's a possibility that the

707
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:36,522
quantum particle, the particle which we have in annealing, they can just

708
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:40,394
tunnel through this whole steep and directly reach

709
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:44,246
this point. And then by usual annealing, we will be able to find the global

710
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:48,206
minimum. This is sort of like the concept of quantum tunneling. And this is

711
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:51,566
the concept which we used when we talk

712
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:55,630
about quantum inspired annealing. Quantum inspired

713
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,206
annealing algorithms, which I think you do have

714
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:03,394
a session on again. So, again, I won't go in bit of detail about

715
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:06,786
this, but this is another concept of important concept which

716
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:10,066
we use when talking about when designing, you would say,

717
00:45:10,088 --> 00:45:13,926
quantum annealing algorithms. Okay, so these

718
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:17,554
were the two majors. One, I mean, we do have concepts of quantum entanglement,

719
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:20,658
but those are sort of like pure quantum concepts.

720
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:25,430
And it's very hard, or it's close to impossible

721
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:28,380
to sort of get those on,

722
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:33,082
simulate them on classical hardware. So these are very

723
00:45:33,136 --> 00:45:36,490
advantageous if you have quantum hardware. But in quantum

724
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,046
inspired world, it becomes a bit harder to simulate these.

725
00:45:40,068 --> 00:45:43,520
So we don't particularly rely on these things.

726
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:47,566
Okay. So these were some of the basic or

727
00:45:47,588 --> 00:45:51,614
important principles of quantum mechanics, which we try to simulate whenever

728
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:55,570
we are trying to work on designing quantum as pad algorithms.

729
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:10,118
So we just cover this slide in

730
00:46:10,124 --> 00:46:13,890
the previous slide where I talked about the principles which we usually employ when we

731
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,510
are talking about designing quantum inspired algorithms.

732
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:21,126
So this slide talks about some of the major, you can say, quantum inspired algorithm,

733
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:22,890
which we do have in operation.

734
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:30,026
Surprisingly enough, not many people know this, but algorithms

735
00:46:30,058 --> 00:46:33,370
like QAOA or quantum approximate optimization algorithms,

736
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,338
your variational quantum eigen solver, and even your quantum

737
00:46:37,354 --> 00:46:41,346
neural networks, you can say all of them, are in some sense, example of

738
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:44,866
your quantum inspired algorithms. So how does

739
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:48,478
that come into play? Is that, see, what happens usually, is that these algorithms

740
00:46:48,574 --> 00:46:51,858
have, basically what they do is they map the problem.

741
00:46:52,024 --> 00:46:55,474
We have a problem statement, and they map the problem onto a function.

742
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:58,742
Right. And what they try to do is they try to optimize that function.

743
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:02,146
And while optimizing that function, as I previously mentioned, they try to use the principles

744
00:47:02,178 --> 00:47:04,934
of quantum parallelism to improve the result.

745
00:47:05,052 --> 00:47:08,620
Again, these algorithms, as I like to call them, are also quantum ready.

746
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,126
That would mean that you can run these algorithms on actual quantum

747
00:47:13,158 --> 00:47:16,698
hardware as well. So what they basically, you can say,

748
00:47:16,784 --> 00:47:20,670
assure you, or they try to guarantee you, is that in future,

749
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:26,046
when you will have better hardware, you should be able to just take

750
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:29,718
these algorithms from here and just put it on a real quantum hardware

751
00:47:29,754 --> 00:47:32,740
and get all the benefits of quantum computers as well.

752
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,186
Okay, now I'll talk a bit detailed about some

753
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:40,606
of the use cases which we have of these quantum

754
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:44,150
computing, quantum inspired algorithms. And one of my personal

755
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,498
favorite being quantum inspired optimization algorithms, which is sort of like my specialty.

756
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:50,920
Sort of like what I particularly work on.

757
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:52,520
Yeah.

758
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,460
So, again, some of the let me just switch my color

759
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,410
some algorithms.

760
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:14,234
So one of the most famous and common algorithms

761
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:17,994
are your Qio algorithms. Quantum inspired

762
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:22,210
optimization, as I call it, basically optimization algorithms,

763
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:27,054
again, which is something which is more of my expertise.

764
00:48:27,182 --> 00:48:31,750
This is where my expertise lies. So, in Qio, we have evolutionary algorithms,

765
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,810
we have annealing algorithms.

766
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:46,506
So these would be the two type of algorithms which we usually have in quantum

767
00:48:46,538 --> 00:48:50,794
inspired optimization. In evolutionary algorithm, you can have a number of algorithms,

768
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:54,746
like QGA, quantum inspired genetic algorithm, basically quantum

769
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:59,086
inspired particle sum optimization, quantum inspired wolf

770
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:02,686
optimization algorithms. In annealing, you'll have your usual annealing

771
00:49:02,718 --> 00:49:03,650
algorithms.

772
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,014
I'll not go in detail about each and every algorithm,

773
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:13,446
but I'll try to give you a glimpse of how they function.

774
00:49:13,628 --> 00:49:17,494
So, basically, any kind of optimization problem is

775
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:20,966
basically optimizing a given function. And this fx is basically

776
00:49:21,068 --> 00:49:24,338
the mapping of a problem, px. So every function has

777
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:27,514
a landscape. Let's say this was the landscape of this

778
00:49:27,552 --> 00:49:30,410
function. And within this landscape,

779
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,206
there is one global minima, right? There could be multiple local minima,

780
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,994
said this is also local minimum. This is a local minimum. This is a local

781
00:49:38,032 --> 00:49:41,326
minimum. There's a local minimum. I'm talking about. This is like

782
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:44,766
a 3d projection, just viewed from above. But in

783
00:49:44,788 --> 00:49:47,760
actual sense, you can also look at it like this,

784
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,426
say this could also be the landscape. And you can see here that this should

785
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:54,882
be the global minimum. So now what happens

786
00:49:54,936 --> 00:50:00,146
is that when

787
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:04,166
we are talking about your classical optimization algorithm, so they usually follow a

788
00:50:04,188 --> 00:50:07,794
very first, I'll start with simple gradient based algorithms,

789
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:10,914
like your stochastic gradient based algorithm, or gradient based algorithm.

790
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:14,758
They start with some, say some point x. So this

791
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:18,422
is some point x. So these algorithms then follow this gradient

792
00:50:18,486 --> 00:50:21,802
of the landscape. So in our case, it's easy to see that

793
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:25,238
this algorithms is likely to get stuck in this local minima,

794
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:28,858
because it won't be possible for the

795
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:32,334
gradient based algorithm to make the jump to this side,

796
00:50:32,452 --> 00:50:36,046
right? We also have stochastic based algorithms which can make

797
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:39,774
this jump, but again, they too have the limitations. And for

798
00:50:39,812 --> 00:50:43,934
complex, say, non convex, what do you call landscapes,

799
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:47,330
they fail. So that is where evolutionary algorithms come into play.

800
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,802
Evolutionary algorithm. See, I'm talking about classical evolutionary algorithm right now.

801
00:50:50,856 --> 00:50:54,498
So those do solve these problems. That is why. So if

802
00:50:54,504 --> 00:50:58,354
you ever work with genetic algorithms, then you must have heard it that genetic algorithms

803
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:00,950
can, in theory, solve any kind of problem.

804
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,706
Given that, first thing is you can map that problem onto

805
00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:08,326
a fitness function, fx. And second is that you have infinite computational

806
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:11,286
resources. Those are very computationally expensive,

807
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:15,206
your genetic algorithms and stuff. So how the genetic algorithm, or any evolutionary algorithm

808
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,462
in general works, is that they prepare candidates c one, c two,

809
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:22,570
c three, c four. And they prepare candidates and they test every candidate

810
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,946
on this function fx, right? So this candidate

811
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:29,690
would basically mean maybe some random points on the landscape.

812
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:32,898
Some random points on the landscape. So they depend on the

813
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:37,058
theory that out of all these candidates, one would perform the best.

814
00:51:37,144 --> 00:51:40,834
In our case, this is the best performing one, right? Let's name

815
00:51:40,872 --> 00:51:44,386
it, c three. So c three is now the best, and the worst is,

816
00:51:44,408 --> 00:51:47,734
say, in our case, it's obvious to see that, okay, this was c one,

817
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:51,378
then c one was the worst performing, then c one would get eliminated.

818
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:55,506
It just follows the basic darwinian theory of evolution that fittest

819
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:58,026
of the survival of the fittest, right?

820
00:51:58,128 --> 00:52:01,270
So c three is the best, c one is the worst.

821
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:05,114
Now, we perform certain operation depending on what kind of evolutionary algorithm we are working

822
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:09,146
with. So in order to ensure that more candidates in the next generation

823
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:12,974
are towards c three, right? So basically, we keep

824
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:16,638
on repeating this process until we finally reach this point

825
00:52:16,724 --> 00:52:20,506
x or our global minimum. This is how your evolutionary

826
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:23,954
algorithm works, right? So where does quantum come into play? Is this

827
00:52:23,992 --> 00:52:27,694
that. See, as I said, that the biggest bottleneck here is the computational

828
00:52:27,742 --> 00:52:31,278
resources for genetic algorithms or for evolutionary algorithms.

829
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:34,898
So, if you remember, I talked about the principle of quantum superposition.

830
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:38,454
So what that would mean is that now that now I can

831
00:52:38,652 --> 00:52:42,818
test multiple possible, for any psi estate,

832
00:52:42,914 --> 00:52:46,486
we know that there are two possible parameters, alpha and beta.

833
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:49,830
So if I modulate this alpha and beta

834
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,434
by using some, I won't go in details, but I start using

835
00:52:53,472 --> 00:52:57,294
some operations, then I

836
00:52:57,332 --> 00:53:01,434
should be able to check multiple solution, multiple candidates on this landscape

837
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:04,986
simultaneously in single operation. So, basically, I used to produce

838
00:53:05,018 --> 00:53:08,266
this advantage of quantum superposition, or quantum expand

839
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:11,626
superposition to improve, to reduce the number of generation

840
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:15,346
it would take me to converge, or basically, I would improve the coherence rate

841
00:53:15,448 --> 00:53:19,118
and I would reduce the computational resources required. Because I'm

842
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:23,110
actually saying that even if I use less number of candidates or,

843
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,534
say, small n, then also

844
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:29,938
I am assuring that I can still converge to the global minimum.

845
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:33,634
So that is, in some sense, how we look at quantum

846
00:53:33,682 --> 00:53:37,686
inspired algorithms. From a practical point of view, we are talking about scalability,

847
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:41,398
right, and still getting some performance boost over the classical hardware.

848
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:44,842
And that is one of the reasons why we are even going towards

849
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:48,286
these kind of algorithms. So I personally, just for the

850
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:51,818
context, I have worked on QGA

851
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:55,530
quantum genetic algorithms. That is qpso quantum

852
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:59,194
inspired sampling algorithm. Quantum inspired sampling algorithms.

853
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:02,866
I have worked on some of other quantum annealing algorithms and

854
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:06,318
everything. So, okay, just for quantum and annealing, we use the same concept,

855
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:09,794
but because annealing, we are talking about reducing the minimum state of

856
00:54:09,832 --> 00:54:13,602
energy. So we convert our function fx into a hamiltonian.

857
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:16,758
What is a hamiltonian? You can look it up. Hamiltonian is

858
00:54:16,764 --> 00:54:19,910
basically an energy function which we try to minimize.

859
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:24,026
So some of the practical use cases, which I have

860
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:27,782
myself worked on by using this evolutionary algorithms

861
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:31,498
are some of the, one of the huge industrial use cases. There could be

862
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:33,130
airfoil optimization,

863
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:42,932
optimization, there would be topology

864
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:43,880
optimization,

865
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,916
and much more. So these are some of the problems which I have personally

866
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:52,424
worked on. And if you look it up, these are very industrial

867
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:56,376
and very high scalability problems. They are computationally

868
00:54:56,408 --> 00:55:00,670
very expensive. The function fx associated with

869
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,556
this function fx associated with both of them, it is

870
00:55:04,578 --> 00:55:07,916
very expensive. It's not easy to evaluate this fx multiple

871
00:55:07,948 --> 00:55:11,184
times continuously. So it becomes very important.

872
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:14,928
The less the number of times I need to calculate this fx, the better my

873
00:55:14,934 --> 00:55:18,748
algorithms is. So I was able to get best results

874
00:55:18,764 --> 00:55:21,924
and better results for these two kinds of problems. So these

875
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:25,428
are sort of like the use cases which I have worked on. There are a

876
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:28,388
tremendous number of use cases. So, as I previously said, right,

877
00:55:28,474 --> 00:55:31,776
that every problem px, which takes argument

878
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:35,368
as x can be, if you can map it onto a function f x,

879
00:55:35,454 --> 00:55:38,504
then you basically need to perform function optimization over this function, right?

880
00:55:38,542 --> 00:55:41,796
You just need to improve the fitness or improve the value of this f x

881
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,764
function. So it becomes a function optimization problem.

882
00:55:44,962 --> 00:55:49,070
So basically, any combinatorial optimization problem

883
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,144
can be mapped to function fx, which can be solved using quantum

884
00:55:53,192 --> 00:55:56,364
inspired optimization algorithms. So that is,

885
00:55:56,402 --> 00:55:59,872
in some sense, I'm talking about it from a very abstract blueprint point of view.

886
00:56:00,006 --> 00:56:04,144
That is, in some sense, how we use quantum inspired algorithms to

887
00:56:04,262 --> 00:56:07,700
perform certain industrial or practical applications.

888
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,164
So, again, this is what I particularly highlighted in the given,

889
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:15,536
you can say given rates that, what are the benefits of quantum

890
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:19,044
and Spad algorithms that they perform certain, they give you performance,

891
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:22,564
performance, certain performance boost over your classical algorithms or classical

892
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:25,572
counterparts, while still being able to maintain,

893
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:29,144
in some sense, scalability, right? But again,

894
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:31,928
there are some limitations of quantum inspired as well,

895
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:35,464
because, see, as I said, that we are not using the full potential

896
00:56:35,512 --> 00:56:39,336
of your quantum computers, right? You're still sort of simulating the properties.

897
00:56:39,448 --> 00:56:42,968
So whenever we talk about simulating the properties, it's important to know that we

898
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:47,040
are restricting the performance which we can get. So this restriction,

899
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,204
depending in some sense, in actuality,

900
00:56:52,252 --> 00:56:55,772
depends on you. How much performance can you give up for scalability,

901
00:56:55,836 --> 00:56:59,500
and how much performance do you actually need to be honest in

902
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:03,188
the problems which I mentioned, like the airfoil problem, topology problem, even a

903
00:57:03,194 --> 00:57:06,836
slight performance benefit or a slight performance boost means a lot, because it's such a

904
00:57:06,858 --> 00:57:10,116
sensitive industry. And the function which I'm trying to

905
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:13,556
optimize is so computationally expensive that even if I'm able to reduce

906
00:57:13,588 --> 00:57:17,432
it by ten generations, the convergence rate, that means a lot.

907
00:57:17,566 --> 00:57:21,196
So that totally depends on the kind of problem or the kind

908
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:22,940
of use case you are targeting.

909
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,086
Okay, so, as I talked, considering all

910
00:57:32,108 --> 00:57:35,926
of this into perspective, considering taking this into perspective, it's easy to

911
00:57:35,948 --> 00:57:39,674
see that quantum inspired algorithms provide an immediate solution of

912
00:57:39,712 --> 00:57:43,606
harnessing the advantages of quantum computers or the principles of quantum

913
00:57:43,638 --> 00:57:47,034
mechanics, and yet not being directly dependent on

914
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:50,350
the hardware side and limitations of hardware. So they do provide

915
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,726
you a sort of like an upkey opportunity to

916
00:57:53,828 --> 00:57:57,326
dive deep into the whole quantum computing aspect in sense

917
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,874
of practicality and sense of application basis, and yet not

918
00:58:00,932 --> 00:58:05,634
being directly dependent on your hardware limitations again.

919
00:58:05,672 --> 00:58:08,946
But this, again is sort of like, what do you call, like a backup plan

920
00:58:09,048 --> 00:58:13,166
sometimes like an immediate plan of action, until eventually

921
00:58:13,278 --> 00:58:17,254
we get the hardware of high quality, which is where we actually run our

922
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:20,674
quantum algorithms and get the so called quantum advantage,

923
00:58:20,722 --> 00:58:24,002
as we call it, the quantum supremacy,

924
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:27,506
as we like to. I mean, we don't use this term anymore,

925
00:58:27,538 --> 00:58:30,746
so I might get some backlash from using the

926
00:58:30,768 --> 00:58:34,454
term quantum supermassive, but in some sense, I'm talking about the pure quantum

927
00:58:34,502 --> 00:58:38,186
advantage. That is something which we can only do after

928
00:58:38,288 --> 00:58:41,774
we have proper quantum hardware. But for the time being. For the time

929
00:58:41,812 --> 00:58:45,310
being. And until that happens, quantum inspired algorithms are a good way of

930
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:48,650
still harnessing the advantages of quantum mechanics principle

931
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,460
by simulating them on a quantum hardware and getting,

932
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:55,954
you can say, some kind of performance benefits for your

933
00:58:55,992 --> 00:59:00,260
use cases or your applications. So, yeah, this is sort of like

934
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:04,626
the whole session. I had to keep it a bit short and

935
00:59:04,648 --> 00:59:07,442
did not dive deep in depth with a lot of concepts.

936
00:59:07,506 --> 00:59:10,774
So in the future, I might has well do different

937
00:59:10,812 --> 00:59:14,294
sessions on that. Or if you're interested, you can reach

938
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:17,910
out to me in person and you can ask me any questions which you have

939
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,734
in depth question or detailed question, or if you want to have a conversation

940
00:59:21,782 --> 00:59:25,018
about detailed discussion about some of the concepts or some of

941
00:59:25,024 --> 00:59:28,506
the use cases or application, which I pointed out, but could not discuss in

942
00:59:28,528 --> 00:59:31,766
detail because of the shortage of time and everything. So I'm

943
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:35,326
always welcome, is always welcome from my side. You can always reach out to

944
00:59:35,348 --> 00:59:38,702
me that has pretty much it for the whole

945
00:59:38,756 --> 00:59:41,360
session. I hope you learned something new,

946
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:45,842
because I think. One of the problems which I used to face,

947
00:59:45,976 --> 00:59:49,406
I'm used to hearing is that from a commercial and industrial

948
00:59:49,438 --> 00:59:52,706
point of view, is that if this is not

949
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:56,290
scalable, if it is not that scalable, why are we even going with it?

950
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,974
Why we are investing a time with this whole thing? Well,

951
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:03,526
my answer to that is quantum inspired algorithms. Exactly the immediate answer. Like,

952
01:00:03,548 --> 01:00:06,898
I'm still using the principles of quantum mechanics. I'm still using my knowledge of quantum

953
01:00:06,914 --> 01:00:10,694
mechanics and quantum computing and quantum information, but I am simulating

954
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:14,474
those in some sense on classical hardware. So I'm still

955
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:18,166
able to get some advantage and still able to maintain some scalability. So quantum inspired

956
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:21,770
is sort of like one of my favorite things, because I get to enjoy

957
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:25,114
quantum computing, and yet I don't have to worry too much about scalability.

958
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:28,906
It is a bit complex. It does get a bit complex, because sometimes that trade

959
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:32,550
off, you'll have to decide on that trade off, and it's

960
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,998
not always good, and it's always about rainbows.

961
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:39,554
Right? You have some limitations to this quantum inspired aspect as

962
01:00:39,592 --> 01:00:43,138
well. But overall, as I said, that it's one

963
01:00:43,144 --> 01:00:46,690
of the potential perfect methodologies of

964
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,922
harnessing the advantages of quantum computing in this

965
01:00:49,976 --> 01:00:53,846
career. So, yeah, that would be it. And thank

966
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:57,414
you for your time and patience. And again, as I stated that, I'll add

967
01:00:57,452 --> 01:01:01,510
another slide after this, and the deck, which I'll share with you guys,

968
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:04,726
which will contain my contact info so that you can reach

969
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:08,200
out to me and you can ask any questions you have.

970
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:12,458
If you want any detailed, if you want to get a conversation about detailed discussion

971
01:01:12,474 --> 01:01:15,678
of any of the topics, I'm always here and feel free to

972
01:01:15,684 --> 01:01:17,500
reach out to me. So thank you.
