1
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,998
Hi everyone, this is Fabio and I will talk with you

2
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:38,870
about why SRE is the best way to improve

3
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,800
efficiency in crisis time like we are living today.

4
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,970
It really reminds me about that song of Foo fighters,

5
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,614
times like this and we are all pretty sure

6
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:56,000
that these times are not being as easy as we would like to.

7
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,902
So we will deep dive in this

8
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:03,842
theme. We will talk about history, what's going on

9
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:07,346
on these financial markets, and why

10
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:10,900
companies should invest their efforts in

11
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,414
improving SRE practices inside their companies and with

12
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:18,838
their teams. Right? A little bit

13
00:01:18,924 --> 00:01:23,542
of history and things

14
00:01:23,596 --> 00:01:26,710
that happened in the last decades.

15
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,614
We were living a huge age of transformation,

16
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:34,570
as we call the age of digital transformation. Everybody called

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,458
about it for a long, long time in many

18
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:40,802
conferences, articles,

19
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:44,478
and a lot of companies had a

20
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:49,230
lot of money because of this, because every

21
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,574
company in the world was running a

22
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,142
digital transformation. And I

23
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:59,682
put some things here that I believe that are the most

24
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:03,314
important regarding some things that

25
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:07,570
happen in the world, some technology advances

26
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,142
and things like that. So I would like to start

27
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:15,894
talking about virtualization as

28
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:19,114
an old guy like me, at the beginning, every project we

29
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:22,634
had, we need a server to

30
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:26,314
work in the project. So we had to

31
00:02:26,352 --> 00:02:29,802
buy the server, install the server and

32
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:33,118
then start working. And these

33
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:37,102
during this period we have the virtualization that

34
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:40,894
is the mother of the cloud computing. That's a

35
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:45,458
huge event that we still see today that

36
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:48,020
changed everything around these world.

37
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,890
We have a completely move

38
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,894
in the way we did

39
00:02:56,012 --> 00:03:00,162
the project management. We moved from the waterfall

40
00:03:00,306 --> 00:03:05,014
to an agile methodology where

41
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,714
we are supposed to implement software as soon as

42
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:11,914
we can, every time as possible.

43
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:15,834
As soon as I sprint was done, we should

44
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:21,502
deploy software to our customers. So because

45
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:24,734
of that we have the rise of

46
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:28,190
DevOps. That was the end of that.

47
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,080
Silos inside the IT departments between

48
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,450
operations and development. So after

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,114
that and after the

50
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:45,446
launching of the iPhone, we saw a

51
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:48,390
huge adoption of mobile technologies.

52
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,726
And after that, a few years later,

53
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,710
we are coming closer to our current time.

54
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,490
We have the Covid-19 pandemics

55
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,682
which accelerated a lot

56
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:08,538
all of the digital transformation around the world.

57
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:12,334
At the beginning we have some companies firing people,

58
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:16,046
but sooner, just a few

59
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:19,790
months later, the market was really

60
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,438
hot. A lot of companies working to get digital

61
00:04:23,614 --> 00:04:27,460
in order to guarantee that everybody could still

62
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,714
work and consuming inside their

63
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:35,938
homes during the period of isolation

64
00:04:36,034 --> 00:04:40,178
and things like that. So we have a lot of opportunities

65
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:44,322
during these pandemics and during this period

66
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:47,586
we have something that's really strange that was called

67
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,380
quiet bursting where everybody was,

68
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,362
I'm not so happy were today and I will

69
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:57,978
just do what I need to do to keep my job.

70
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:01,694
And that was called quiet quitting. It was something

71
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:06,906
that was a lot of companies were concerned

72
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:10,414
about it. Another situation that we

73
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:14,162
had was regarding developers that

74
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:19,090
was having many simultaneous jobs,

75
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,402
developers working in two these four companies at the same

76
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:28,182
time because the market was so hot, there were

77
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:32,358
so many opportunities and everybody was trying to get their money

78
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:36,022
from that. So we have this situation with

79
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:39,846
overworking, as I like to say. And regarding

80
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:43,194
technology, in the end of the

81
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:46,666
last few years, everybody was talking about

82
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:50,462
Web 30, metaverse and

83
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,094
NFT. And now what we are

84
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:57,166
talking about, what changed a

85
00:05:57,188 --> 00:06:00,480
lot during these last few months.

86
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,674
We are leaving now what I like to call the age

87
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:09,118
of digital eficiency. We are not concerned

88
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:12,370
anymore on just being digital.

89
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,858
We are concerned about being eficiency efficient

90
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:21,958
in the digital way. Why is that happening?

91
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:26,610
After the pandemics, we saw a bubble

92
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,030
exploding around the world. In the economic scenario,

93
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,690
we have a word in a recession in

94
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,974
many countries, you have an inflation that

95
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:43,326
we didn't sre for many years. A lot

96
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:47,070
of companies are cutting their budget.

97
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,480
Everybody that was working to

98
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,130
manage their budgets for 2023,

99
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,420
they are reviewing these results, how much they will invest,

100
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,514
these would invest in this year and

101
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:09,554
then start the wave of layoffs

102
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:13,446
as I will explore a little more in the next few

103
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:18,070
slides. And we saw a new technology emerging

104
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,686
that it was not on our rear

105
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:27,562
view mirror. Nobody was expecting that we should

106
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:31,386
have this change around the technology.

107
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:35,406
But the Chat GPT is a

108
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:39,594
revolution that we are seeing in the last few months and that's changing

109
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:43,102
everything. Everybody's feeling pressured to be

110
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:46,802
more effective and chatt could be also

111
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:49,780
can opportunity moving forward.

112
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,010
We have here delay.

113
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,000
These is panic in the world.

114
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,214
Panic, panic, panic around the world.

115
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:06,134
Because what was a hot market is now

116
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,090
a market where we don't have a lot of opportunities.

117
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,010
So just a few examples.

118
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,294
Amazon during the last few months had

119
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:24,080
eliminated around 27,000

120
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,830
positions, right?

121
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,830
27,000 employees was fired from

122
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,180
Amazon. Another big tech here,

123
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,386
Microsoft laid off

124
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:40,450
10,000 employees.

125
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,090
Salesforce,

126
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,550
they reduced 10% of their workforce.

127
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,150
Meta Facebook,

128
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,994
they have eliminated around 13%

129
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:02,394
of their employees during these last year

130
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:06,010
and they expect to do more

131
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,650
during this one. Accenture,

132
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,680
a huge consulting company,

133
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,726
they laid off 19,000

134
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:19,294
people. So what does it

135
00:09:19,332 --> 00:09:22,846
bring to us? Everybody's losing their job,

136
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:26,386
many people, not everybody for sure, because we have

137
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:30,018
billion people in the world, but we have a lot of people

138
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:33,922
losing these jobs. And that's something that have

139
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:37,718
put a lot of pressure inside companies and

140
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:41,970
on thinking what should we do to guarantee

141
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,246
that we won't have to fire anyone? Nobody likes to fire

142
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:49,434
people. I'm an executive. I had to fire some

143
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:53,258
people in the past, but that's not a

144
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:56,602
pleasant situation. So nobody wants

145
00:09:56,656 --> 00:10:00,510
to be in that position. And the object

146
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,062
of my lecture were, is how we can use

147
00:10:04,116 --> 00:10:07,374
SRE to prevent these kind of situation.

148
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:10,190
So let's see in the next few slides.

149
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,114
As I told before, 2023 is the

150
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:17,810
year of efficiency. Everybody's trying to save

151
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,300
money, and I like to sre something with you guys.

152
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,574
I was working in a huge company a few

153
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:29,670
months ago, and I was responsible for

154
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,830
doing some savings strategy.

155
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,434
But what was the expectation of my company to

156
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,610
do to generate savings?

157
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,650
Adopting power platform and dashboards.

158
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,970
How would I was supposed to improve the

159
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,126
developers eficiency? Just doing that,

160
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:58,062
it's not possible. And that's the reason why

161
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,774
I'm not working there anymore, because that's something that

162
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:05,922
I strongly don't believe. I believe that you should do something

163
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:09,374
more structural. And one of my hypotheses

164
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:12,514
is investing in SRE to do so.

165
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:16,582
And let's see what I can bring to you in order to

166
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:17,480
do that.

167
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,382
But in the end, what all these

168
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,774
2003 crisis brings to us, what does

169
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,822
it mean in the end? Obviously investment,

170
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:34,554
but no investment. People and

171
00:11:34,592 --> 00:11:38,378
companies would only invest what they can.

172
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,240
And that's something that you should invest,

173
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,638
because nobody wants to get the risk of losing money

174
00:11:46,724 --> 00:11:50,160
and soon had to fire anyone.

175
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,158
Everybody's searching for saving on operations,

176
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:58,498
okay, I will not grow. And how can I save money

177
00:11:58,664 --> 00:12:02,018
inside my operations? How can I

178
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:05,418
automate my operations and generate some savings?

179
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:09,400
How can I better use my team

180
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,774
to work better, generate more,

181
00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:17,218
right? And as we

182
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,274
all know, some companies are staking this

183
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:24,614
moment to eliminate some people that was not performing

184
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:29,974
well, people that they knew that were working

185
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:34,270
in many companies at the same time, things like that,

186
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,720
companies are taking this moment,

187
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,734
I will do some kind of

188
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:44,210
diet, were with my employees. I have somebody that

189
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,082
is not performing well, or maybe they are working here

190
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:52,434
in two more consulting firms. That's not

191
00:12:52,632 --> 00:12:56,422
something that should be acceptable, but people were doing that.

192
00:12:56,556 --> 00:13:00,120
So companies are taking these opportunities too.

193
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,360
And what is on the table for us,

194
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:09,482
what we as technologists should

195
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:13,098
be thinking of? We should thinking

196
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:16,730
about eficiency and

197
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,022
adopting AI. Everybody's talking

198
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:23,998
about Chat GPT, but at this very moment,

199
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:27,662
I cannot say that very easy for us to

200
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:31,374
adopt Chat GPT in order to

201
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:34,514
change the game and save people.

202
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:37,954
But what I can say is that if we

203
00:13:37,992 --> 00:13:41,874
can invest our efforts on eficiency and

204
00:13:41,912 --> 00:13:45,746
adopting Sre the right way, I strongly believe

205
00:13:45,848 --> 00:13:49,622
that we can do a good job and some

206
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,494
positions right. And we will explore more.

207
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:57,590
And why should companies invest on SRE?

208
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,906
First of all, first of all,

209
00:14:01,088 --> 00:14:04,170
SRE will improve system reliability.

210
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,822
If your system is more reliable, probably you won't

211
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:12,798
have many incidents. And then we go to the second

212
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:15,710
point, faster incident resolution.

213
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,560
If you solve your incidents in a faster way,

214
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,570
your products will be available for your customers for more

215
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,050
time. You won't lose any

216
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,698
selling things like that. So one thing

217
00:14:33,864 --> 00:14:37,014
turns to the other. I have a

218
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:41,062
more reliable system, so I will resolve my

219
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:45,154
incidents faster. I will increase

220
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:49,146
my agility because as we

221
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:52,550
all know here, SRE and DevOps

222
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,922
are kind of brothers, twin brothers that

223
00:14:56,976 --> 00:15:01,354
share some similar missions. So our agility

224
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:04,346
will increase significantly.

225
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:08,320
So that would be something really important for companies.

226
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,350
SRE would increase the collaboration inside

227
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,510
the company. When operation

228
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,330
teams and development teams work together,

229
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,738
they seem to collaborate more, they create

230
00:15:22,824 --> 00:15:26,838
more confidence with each other and so they will be able

231
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:29,522
to deliver best software,

232
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:34,018
improve all these environment

233
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:37,286
inside the IT department. And I

234
00:15:37,308 --> 00:15:41,290
would believe that it would really diminish

235
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,686
these pressure under these teams.

236
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,954
Everybody in technology in

237
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:52,890
these last months are feeling very pressured,

238
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,670
afraid of losing their jobs. And when

239
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,170
we work in this collaboration environment,

240
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,130
it would bring some peace for these people and they will see

241
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,682
the results of their efforts, right? That would be

242
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:09,954
really great for your company.

243
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:14,210
And of course, if we have all of this,

244
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,830
all of our customers will be more satisfied.

245
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,742
The systems that we use will be available for more

246
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:25,910
time. We won't have incidents, things like that.

247
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,086
So customer satisfaction shouldn't increase.

248
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:34,022
And that would probably help us with our nps

249
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,674
and other indicators that we might have in our

250
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:39,180
company. Okay,

251
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,240
continuing. Why should companies invest?

252
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,910
Continuing. Reduce downtime costs.

253
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,506
Every time our application is down, we are

254
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:56,066
losing money with SRE. We won't do

255
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:59,282
that. We don't lose that money. We will increase our

256
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:03,394
efficiency. It's the theme of

257
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:06,962
our lecture. So when you implement

258
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,550
it, when you are in a mature way, working with

259
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,310
SRE, you will increase your whole

260
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,570
eficiency. All your team will work better. You will

261
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,730
deliver more software.

262
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,846
If you don't have to spend so many time fixing

263
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:30,274
bugs or working in incidents, there's a huge probability

264
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:34,602
that you can spend more time developing

265
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:38,110
new features and bring more business to

266
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,230
your company. You will have a better resource allocation

267
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,130
because people won't be investing time

268
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,718
fixing bugs, but developing new features

269
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:53,998
or improving your environment.

270
00:17:54,094 --> 00:17:58,070
Everything, it's a virtual

271
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,070
cycle. You will improve your scalability.

272
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,246
When you have a moment where you have a

273
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,730
lot of access in your platforms,

274
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,194
your scalability will be doing very well, because your

275
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:16,746
team will be not invest a

276
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:19,690
lot of time improving this scalability.

277
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,274
And for sure you will reduce

278
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:27,230
your maintenance cost, because you won't have some bugs, you won't have problems

279
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,074
in your infrastructure, you will scale faster,

280
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:35,730
and then all your maintenance costs should be

281
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,700
reduced. And following here,

282
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,178
this is really interesting, because we always

283
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:47,814
think about SRE, considering that we

284
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:51,586
would improve our internal environment

285
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:55,046
and the services that we would provide to

286
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:59,094
our customers. But what about consulting

287
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:02,170
firms? Why should they invest in SRE?

288
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,730
They are under a huge pressure,

289
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,214
I believe that higher pressure than the other companies,

290
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,542
because when we have any

291
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:18,462
cries, the first thing companies

292
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:21,614
cut is these investment on technology.

293
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:25,326
And that's

294
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:29,234
the main reason we have consulting firms. So a lot

295
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:33,358
of them sre under a huge pressure

296
00:19:33,454 --> 00:19:36,866
of customers, of clients canceling

297
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:41,398
their projects. And why should they invest

298
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:45,590
on SRE in their development teams and their practices.

299
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,174
They should adopt SRE because it will differentiate

300
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:55,578
them. And that's what will be on the table for the

301
00:19:55,744 --> 00:19:59,642
consulting firms. Because when we have

302
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:04,654
now chat, GPT and everybody under crises time,

303
00:20:04,692 --> 00:20:08,478
main factor to decide between

304
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:13,618
a company or other is paying

305
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:17,506
these same money, I would have more code,

306
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:20,994
more application. What will

307
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:25,086
be better for me investing in this company instead of

308
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:29,666
the other? And when a company consulting

309
00:20:29,698 --> 00:20:32,310
firm that adopt SRE,

310
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,480
in their practices, in their culture, probably will

311
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,562
deliver more software, not only

312
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:45,402
deliver more, but deliver in better way,

313
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,430
with better code, low bugs

314
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,430
and thinking about the scalability,

315
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,350
the software that you will deliver,

316
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,906
will reduce the meantime to repair, will improve

317
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:05,154
these security of the applications, and will

318
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:09,780
be more reliable on the perspective of

319
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:14,290
the application of the architecture, right? So we

320
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,698
should invest everyone in SRE.

321
00:21:17,874 --> 00:21:19,270
During this period.

322
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,320
When we talk about SRE, we always have a lot of

323
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,242
qualitative results. We called

324
00:21:31,296 --> 00:21:35,500
about many of them in the last few

325
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,490
slides, but I'd like to bring some quantitative

326
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,934
results for you. For example, Google is the

327
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:47,998
father, the creator of the SRE. And Google

328
00:21:48,084 --> 00:21:52,042
has reported that SRE has helped them reduce

329
00:21:52,106 --> 00:21:56,814
its incident rate by 50% it's

330
00:21:56,862 --> 00:22:00,306
too much. And improved these

331
00:22:00,408 --> 00:22:02,082
reliability in 99,

332
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:09,894
95% too

333
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:14,466
much LinkedIn, after adopting SRE,

334
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:19,740
they reduced its incident rate by 85%.

335
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,086
A lot of things. And these company also reported

336
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:27,530
that it was able to improve these MTTR

337
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,662
by 75% too

338
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:34,842
much. Netflix, everybody likes Netflix,

339
00:22:34,906 --> 00:22:38,990
right? Another company that's under a huge pressure,

340
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,882
not only because of everything that's going on the market,

341
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:46,670
but because of the signature crises

342
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,630
time, because everybody was sharing their signature,

343
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,790
but Netflix adopt SRE

344
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,280
since 2010 and they reported that it has helped them

345
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,800
achieve an availability of 99 99%

346
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,342
too much pain. It's too much. And Netflix

347
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:11,974
also reports that it has reduced heat downtime

348
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:15,930
by 9% 90% after

349
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,330
adopting SRE.

350
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,650
And last but not least, Dropbox.

351
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,702
They reduced these outage by

352
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:30,430
90% after adopting SRE

353
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,642
and they reduce the number of incidents by

354
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:36,900
75%.

355
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,666
When we are under attack in a

356
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:45,430
moment where everybody needs to

357
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,070
cut in the bone,

358
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,662
this kind of reducing would help

359
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:55,190
a company to save a lot of jobs,

360
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:01,290
right? So let's continue were and

361
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,100
here I would like to share some data from the market

362
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,690
related to state of SRE and

363
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,080
why we have a huge opportunity.

364
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,214
Take a look of how is the adoption of

365
00:24:17,252 --> 00:24:22,994
these SRE. We have 6%

366
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:26,994
of the market that's totally immature in these

367
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:27,810
practice,

368
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,330
32% that's emerging,

369
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,880
only emerging. We have 42.

370
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,680
That's maturing is too much.

371
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:49,690
If we sum all of these, we have 80%

372
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,306
of the market that's not

373
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,354
adopting completely the

374
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:58,090
SRE.

375
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,454
Can you see the amount of

376
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:06,926
this opportunity that we have here? 80% of the

377
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:10,974
market has the opportunity to save money

378
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,550
to improve their operations only by adopting SRE

379
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,890
practices combined to DevOps and Et cetera.

380
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,260
It's a lot of being. Let's see some

381
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,870
other important information regarding the sres,

382
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,000
what they are dedicating most of the time

383
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,010
doing and how this relates to

384
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,860
efficiency. Almost 70%

385
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,998
reducing the MTTR it's

386
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:53,146
a lot of things. It's a lot of things when you're spending

387
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:56,560
all this time and it will bring the result.

388
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,070
67 reducing MTTR 60

389
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,140
building and maintaining automation code

390
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,190
automation would generate a lot of savings

391
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,458
and eficiency and time

392
00:26:13,544 --> 00:26:17,046
free to spend and more important activities for

393
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:21,160
your team and your company. Ensuring security

394
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,800
vulnerabilities are detected and eliminated quickly.

395
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,346
Security is a huge problem for tech companies.

396
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:33,818
So you have this SRE team

397
00:26:33,904 --> 00:26:37,180
spending more than 50% of your time.

398
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:42,650
Design experiments, running tests to reduce risk of production

399
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,554
failure. Nobody wants to have failure

400
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:50,880
in production. And you can see here all of this information

401
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,538
about how you can use your team

402
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:59,586
in a better way. What are the

403
00:26:59,688 --> 00:27:03,054
expecting expectations and demands

404
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:06,582
on SRE, what these want

405
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:10,614
to achieve? And which

406
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:14,882
of the following tasks do SRE in your organizations dedicate

407
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:18,618
the largest amount of their time on an average week?

408
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:22,790
The same as we saw before. Reducing MTTR,

409
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,900
things like that. Building automating code.

410
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:31,230
It's really good, it's investment.

411
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,630
You're investing a lot of time were a lot of effort

412
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,350
for in the future you can save

413
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,082
a lot of time and your

414
00:27:44,136 --> 00:27:47,490
operation of incidents and outages.

415
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,642
How does your organization evaluate service level for its

416
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:56,950
applications and infrastructure?

417
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,446
That's something that I would like to indicate here.

418
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:05,026
A lot of companies works with okrs

419
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,774
and key performance indicators, but these

420
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,822
heart of SRE is the

421
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:17,210
slO. So 75% of the companies that

422
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,182
answer these state of SRE, they work

423
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:24,782
with slos. And why is that so

424
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:31,070
important? Because slos

425
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,962
would really, as we know everybody knows here

426
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:38,514
in this conference, SLO is

427
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:42,110
the key indicator for us to work with SRE.

428
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,102
And we have a lot of difficulties working with

429
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:50,354
this. So investing

430
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:53,910
a lot of time in SRE would request

431
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,198
invest a lot of time defining slos

432
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:01,830
the right way. We have a huge challenge

433
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,898
here in defining and to getting this

434
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:09,718
information, because we have too much information,

435
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:13,374
too much data inside our company and we have

436
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,760
to clean this data.

437
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:20,782
Like all data science that we know,

438
00:29:20,836 --> 00:29:24,370
we have to work a lot to get this

439
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,842
data really good in order to

440
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:31,422
be effective managing our SLOs

441
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:35,086
and the SLOs are the core of the

442
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:37,698
success of the SRE,

443
00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:41,734
because with the SLO we will

444
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:45,794
have our error budget and the error

445
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:50,682
budget is what will help

446
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:54,106
us provide a

447
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:57,498
safer environment where we can have some

448
00:29:57,584 --> 00:30:01,662
experiments and where we can even get

449
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,882
wrong sometimes. So the difficulties

450
00:30:05,946 --> 00:30:09,690
that we have creating and defining slos,

451
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,394
we have too much data, too much

452
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:16,690
data sources, too many metrics,

453
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,374
monitoring tools that don't allow to easily

454
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:24,786
get that slo. So you have to

455
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:28,662
invest a lot of time and effort defining and really

456
00:30:28,716 --> 00:30:30,870
getting your slos.

457
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,550
Continuing here. Some are really good slos

458
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,458
to implement in order to be

459
00:30:40,544 --> 00:30:43,754
successful in your SRE. And here we

460
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:47,770
have some slos for

461
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,234
the business point of view, even the mobile ones

462
00:30:52,432 --> 00:30:55,258
for the business and end user centric,

463
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,950
right? That's another buzzword,

464
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,202
always availability. We have to measure

465
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:06,162
the engagement, we have to measure the

466
00:31:06,216 --> 00:31:09,922
user satisfaction, the conversion of our platform,

467
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:14,398
how is that going? And of course we have our performance

468
00:31:14,494 --> 00:31:17,586
slos. How is our utilization,

469
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,310
response time, traffic,

470
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,640
saturation, success rate?

471
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,758
Every one of these slos are really important for us

472
00:31:28,924 --> 00:31:32,394
on the technical point of view and

473
00:31:32,512 --> 00:31:36,198
for mobile applications. Everyone is mobile

474
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,238
today, right? So, app adoption,

475
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:43,246
availability of the app, response time,

476
00:31:43,428 --> 00:31:47,102
you should provide a good experience and SRE will help

477
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:50,702
you a lot. Improving this response time,

478
00:31:50,836 --> 00:31:52,160
success rate,

479
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,750
crashes and of course app rating.

480
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,118
Everybody wants to know, how is your company evaluation

481
00:32:01,214 --> 00:32:05,350
on the App Store and how

482
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,966
would you identify how the companies identify the

483
00:32:08,988 --> 00:32:12,550
targets for each of your slos?

484
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,160
26% do that based on end user experience,

485
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,490
24 based on historical data and industry

486
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,986
standards and 20% on our system

487
00:32:27,168 --> 00:32:30,300
on however our system is doing today.

488
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,050
And who in the company helps

489
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,030
in defining these slos.

490
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:44,450
The SRE team is responsible for 80 80%

491
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,434
security, which is really important and

492
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:52,510
they really contribute a lot for these SRE

493
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,214
adoption and for our success. 49% from

494
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:58,600
the business 47,

495
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,520
infrastructure 45,

496
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,454
DevOps 41, operations platform

497
00:33:06,572 --> 00:33:10,330
36, development 33 and Application

498
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,106
32 were we

499
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:17,914
have some other opportunities here. That's not the

500
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:21,050
theme of this lecture,

501
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,874
but as soon as you evolve adopting

502
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,794
DevOps and SRE, you should consider evolving

503
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:33,394
to an AIOPs environment using

504
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:37,074
everything that you can to automate the response for

505
00:33:37,112 --> 00:33:41,140
everything that happens in your operation and

506
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,302
the platforms that you might use would help you provide

507
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,270
that. And I strongly believe that with

508
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:53,542
all the advances that we have with

509
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:57,378
chat DPT, that would be a reality

510
00:33:57,474 --> 00:34:01,546
even for I would believe that chatDPT and

511
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:04,890
all these new generative AI would

512
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,954
increase the adoption of AI ops and last but not

513
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:11,070
least, finops.

514
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,150
We have a lot of expenditure unnecessarily

515
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,762
expenditure with cloud costs.

516
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:23,018
So we should work in order to keep this

517
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:27,154
on the right way, deploying exactly what

518
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:31,922
needed for each application and for each environment. So we

519
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:35,478
should work to keep the Finops working

520
00:34:35,564 --> 00:34:39,602
really well and SRE and DevOps.

521
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:43,414
Right. We are coming to the end of this lecture and

522
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:47,174
I would like to share with you some key

523
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:51,594
takeaways of this lecture that I really like you guys to

524
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:55,098
save in our mind for this year and probably

525
00:34:55,184 --> 00:34:59,370
the next one. That should be harder years for us

526
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,340
working with technology. Right? We have

527
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,966
SRe increased the commitment and morale of the team.

528
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:12,198
We are in a moment where people SRE feeling

529
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:16,274
are afraid. They are not feeling confident, they are

530
00:35:16,312 --> 00:35:20,622
afraid of losing their jobs. SRe increase the commitment

531
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:23,886
of their working together and improve their morale.

532
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:27,958
That will be great for your company. Besides the obvious

533
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,760
qualitative benefits, as were seen,

534
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,950
SRE generates quantitative results.

535
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,770
We believe and we should insist inside

536
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,766
our companies that we have quantitative results

537
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:47,130
that are feasible and that they generate

538
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,374
economic and financial returns to our company.

539
00:35:51,572 --> 00:35:54,878
We will increase our agility as a company.

540
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:58,494
We will be faster and then we should invest

541
00:35:58,612 --> 00:36:02,726
in SRE. Even for consulting

542
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:06,078
firms, it will be a huge differentiation.

543
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:10,034
You can sell SRE projects and you

544
00:36:10,072 --> 00:36:13,598
