1
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,910
Are actually going to start off today with a little bit of a game.

2
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,654
I'm going to give you about 15 seconds to go around your house and

3
00:00:45,692 --> 00:00:49,154
find two major items. See, the first item

4
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:53,306
is going to be something in your household that begins

5
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:57,022
with the first letter of your first name. The second

6
00:00:57,076 --> 00:01:00,526
item that you're going to grab is going to be an item that begins with

7
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:03,794
the first letter of your last name. Ready?

8
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:07,234
Go. Okay, let me

9
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:11,010
share the items that I brought with me. See, my first name

10
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,626
is Amber, and so I brought an apple because both begin

11
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:19,154
with the letter a. My last name, amber Vanderburg,

12
00:01:19,282 --> 00:01:22,674
which is actually Dutch, and it means from the castle.

13
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:26,070
And V was a little bit tricky for me, but I found

14
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,182
a vinyl record. So I have an apple

15
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:33,434
for Ember and a vinyl record.

16
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:37,114
Amber Vanderburg. And this is

17
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:41,194
just a fun way to really

18
00:01:41,232 --> 00:01:44,974
get to know one another. See, I've worked with teams from

19
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:48,878
all over the world. I'm actually the owner of a company called the Pathwayz Group,

20
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:52,826
and we work with teams all over the world, helping in effective

21
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:56,814
leadership training and team building and strategic human resources.

22
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,386
And one thing that we found, especially in this remote time,

23
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:04,338
is that many are suffering from a little bit of

24
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:07,942
screen fatigue. And this is a

25
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:11,846
very practical and fun way that we can get

26
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:15,478
our team members up, moving around and also

27
00:02:15,644 --> 00:02:19,114
keeping them engaged, and then also being able to

28
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:23,530
bring back the personality and the relationship aspect

29
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,946
of youre meetings. See, it's so important

30
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:32,014
that we are so intentional about building those

31
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,914
relationships and having that personal communication

32
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:38,510
beyond professional gap.

33
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,926
And this is one game that I really encourage you

34
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:46,930
to use within your meetings to continue

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,754
to be intentional in building that relationship. Whether it be a fun

36
00:02:50,792 --> 00:02:54,126
game like this or a show and tell or telling

37
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,990
funny stories or dressing up, these are fun

38
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,960
and, dare I say, innovative ways to

39
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,502
bring back the personality and the relationship side

40
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:10,054
of our meetings. So I guess we've done innovative

41
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:16,554
problem solving in the first, oh, I guess, minute of

42
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:19,610
this presentation. But being innovative,

43
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,998
and you see, innovation really comes down to problem

44
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:28,058
solving. And it's so important in our innovation

45
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:31,950
methods to first identify what type

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,290
of problem that we're solving.

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,330
See, if youre looking for an answer,

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,570
you're probably going to find an answer. But if you're not asking the right

49
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,538
questions and clearly identifying what types of problems

50
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:49,314
that you're solving, then the answer that you seek

51
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:53,094
might not be the solution. The answer that you

52
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,514
get might not be the solution that you're seeking. So it's

53
00:03:56,562 --> 00:04:00,314
really important that we first get specific so

54
00:04:00,352 --> 00:04:04,118
that we can get strategic in our innovation methods.

55
00:04:04,214 --> 00:04:07,414
We don't want to be innovative just for innovation's sake,

56
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:10,974
we want to be innovative. That way we can

57
00:04:11,092 --> 00:04:15,306
be strategic and be creative in our problem solving.

58
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:19,294
What I founder with, working with teams all over the world, is that there

59
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:23,442
are three major types of problems that many

60
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:27,538
teams will solve. The first is to fix

61
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:31,426
or repair can existing system,

62
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:34,674
process or product. And it's in

63
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:38,626
these scenarios that we are fixing something that is existing

64
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:42,086
and that is the type of problem that we're solving that I

65
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:46,054
would really encourage your team to do a causal analysis and

66
00:04:46,092 --> 00:04:49,498
really get down to the root cause of what that

67
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:53,146
problem actually is that way. Again, youre can

68
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:57,114
be specific so that you can be strategic in

69
00:04:57,152 --> 00:05:00,750
your innovation efforts. So the first type of problem

70
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,014
is to fix an existing product,

71
00:05:04,132 --> 00:05:08,506
system or process. The next is to improve

72
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:12,800
or build upon an existing product,

73
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,422
system or service. And in these scenarios,

74
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,754
your innovation methods are going to be a little bit different

75
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:24,274
from fixing a problem. Here you're actually

76
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:27,926
improving upon a problem or

77
00:05:27,948 --> 00:05:31,698
you're improving upon a product. And so in these scenarios,

78
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:35,654
I highly suggest a bit of value engineering and

79
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:39,194
identifying what about your product is great

80
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:42,986
now that you can improve upon. And it's in

81
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:47,142
these scenarios that we oftentimes seek to be more innovative

82
00:05:47,206 --> 00:05:50,542
and improve upon our products so that we can stay

83
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:54,206
competitive, so that we can stay relevant and

84
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:58,090
we can stay engaged with our target audience.

85
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,090
It's for reasons like this that we have an iPhone 5678,

86
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,490
ninja ten. We have variations.

87
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,434
As our technology is improving, we are

88
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:16,150
seeking to be more innovative so that we can improve youre

89
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,070
products to, again, stay relevant and to stay engaged.

90
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,558
This method and this product and this process is going to

91
00:06:25,564 --> 00:06:28,620
be a little bit different than fixing an existing problem.

92
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,634
So the first is to fix an existing problem. The second is to

93
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:37,226
improve upon an existing product or service.

94
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,922
And then the third is to create something totally

95
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:44,558
new. And it's in these scenarios that I think of

96
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:48,954
great inventors like Edison and Tesla and Disney

97
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:53,634
that created something totally new and

98
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:56,530
that were very innovative within their own efforts.

99
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,166
And so again, it's very important that we identify

100
00:07:01,278 --> 00:07:04,814
the types of problems that we are solving and

101
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:08,050
really bring a purpose to our innovation.

102
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,814
That way we can be strategic in our

103
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:15,266
innovation efforts. And this really boils

104
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:18,460
down to asking the right questions

105
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,786
so that we can identify the problems that we

106
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:27,420
are solving. And this comes in a few different ways.

107
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,214
First, I'm very specific in the way that I am

108
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:34,894
asking my question. This isn't a dramatic shift. It's a

109
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,600
slight pivot. I'll give you an example.

110
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,902
What is five plus five? The answer

111
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:45,234
is ten. But what if I ask the question this

112
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:49,060
way? What two numbers equal ten?

113
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,446
By asking this question just slightly differently, I've opened

114
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:57,670
up the doors to more possible answers.

115
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,686
Yes, there is five plus five, but there's also six plus four.

116
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:05,762
Seven plus three. Ninja plus one. There's a variety

117
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:09,366
of different answers that

118
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,274
we can bring to the table, depending on the way that we ask the question.

119
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:17,530
And then also, I encourage your team to ask a series of

120
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,578
whys and whats, and asking it at least

121
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:25,342
three to five times to really get down to the root cause.

122
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:29,566
Again, it's so important that we have a purpose behind our

123
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:33,860
innovation. The more and more I work with teams, I find that the

124
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:37,906
biggest oversight to innovation efforts really

125
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:41,394
is in the beginning and identifying exactly

126
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:44,530
what problem you are solving.

127
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,582
So it's important to first identify the problem

128
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:50,150
that youre are solving,

129
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,714
and then after you have identified the problem that youre solving,

130
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:59,834
it is so important that we can create an environment where

131
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,410
people can truly thrive.

132
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,106
Now, this comes from building a

133
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:10,314
type of balance within your team, and balance is

134
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:13,614
going to come in a few different ways. First,

135
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:16,910
it's important that we try to create

136
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,462
an environment and take on a challenge that will allow us to enter

137
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:24,146
into our flow state. Now, flow is a

138
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:27,486
concept by a psychologist named Mihai

139
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:30,690
Shishek. Mihai. I think I said that right?

140
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,078
And he writes about this concept of flow,

141
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:37,638
meaning that it is important

142
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:41,542
that we try to find a level of challenge that

143
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:45,094
meets our current ability. So if I

144
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:49,226
have a current ability of running a

145
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:53,546
mile, then taking on a challenge of running 15

146
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:57,066
miles is probably going to be very

147
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:00,686
frustrating for me. It's going to be a little

148
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,254
bit disheartening, and I will more than likely not be

149
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:08,266
into my flow state. More than likely,

150
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:11,758
I'll probably give up at some point in that

151
00:10:11,924 --> 00:10:16,030
project because it is significantly above

152
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,882
my current level. In the same regard,

153
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:22,994
if I am used to running 10 miles and then I

154
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:26,854
run a half a mile, then more than likely I'll become

155
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:30,882
a little bit bored and disengaged and disinterested

156
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:34,920
and not really enter into that flow state either.

157
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,690
The key is to find something that

158
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,022
takes into consideration our current ability and then challenges

159
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:48,330
us just a little bit higher so that we are challenged

160
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,934
and we do feel that challenge, but it also is within our

161
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:54,942
ability. And so that is how we can enter in, really,

162
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:58,426
through our biggest flow state. So it's

163
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:02,094
important, whenever we are creating our environment, that we

164
00:11:02,132 --> 00:11:05,746
create an environment that will allow people to enter in through their

165
00:11:05,768 --> 00:11:09,214
flow state. The next balance

166
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:13,106
that we can seek within our teams is to create a

167
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:16,834
balance within our existing systems

168
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:20,086
and really creating an

169
00:11:20,108 --> 00:11:23,746
environment that has a balance within our framework.

170
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:27,198
And this just means having a balance within the constraints.

171
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:31,174
So we want to clearly identify

172
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:35,146
the goal, we want to clearly identify the problem, and then also

173
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:39,210
clearly identify the framework in which we are working.

174
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,578
It is very critical for our leaders to identify

175
00:11:43,674 --> 00:11:47,230
the what and the why, and then provide

176
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,814
opportunity for ownership within the how,

177
00:11:50,932 --> 00:11:55,134
within the processes and the methods and the projects and the roles

178
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:58,498
within that framework. So having an open

179
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,226
framework with no constraints at all

180
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:05,830
is actually limiting for creativity.

181
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,310
True creativity actually thrives with some constraints,

182
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,546
and so it's important that we take that time to identify the framework.

183
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:20,074
Of course, in the same regard, if we go on the other end and

184
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:24,358
provide so many constraints, that can be very frustrating

185
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,754
to our team members as well. And so what

186
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:31,690
I would recommend for your team is to clearly identify

187
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,402
that what and that why and then clearly

188
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:39,614
outline what the framework is and what those constraints are, and then

189
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:42,946
provide opportunity for ownership within the

190
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:47,022
how. So provide. Seek balance

191
00:12:47,086 --> 00:12:50,210
within flow. Also seek balance within your framework.

192
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:54,350
Finally, seek balance within your feedback loops.

193
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,402
Now, many of you are within our developers

194
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:02,246
and are within the development industry, and so you

195
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:06,534
know a lot about feedback loops, and especially in

196
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:10,230
youre ideation phase, it is very critical

197
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,954
that we are mindful of a balance within the

198
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:18,230
span of time within our feedback loops.

199
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,790
So if you are in a brainstorming session and

200
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,118
every idea is shut down before it is

201
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,462
even fully said, if everything is

202
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,902
being criticized directly

203
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:36,942
every single time, then that can actually create an environment

204
00:13:37,086 --> 00:13:41,186
where team members are less likely to

205
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:45,378
share their ideas and are less likely to enter into

206
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:49,222
that flow state and less likely to share their

207
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:52,806
most innovative ideas. And so it's important that we have a balance that

208
00:13:52,828 --> 00:13:55,894
we are taking in a lot of ideas, that we

209
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:58,902
are, especially in this ideation phase,

210
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:03,034
that we are listening to those ideas, and then having that

211
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:06,810
feedback loop of analyzing the idea after

212
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,570
it has been fully, after it's been formated,

213
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,446
after it's been vocalized to a certain degree. So it's important that we

214
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:17,738
have a balance within those feedback loops of providing feedback.

215
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:21,422
Yes, we don't want an idea, a single idea, to go

216
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,978
all the way through completion and then having a

217
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:28,882
feedback loop, but saying, oh, let's actually analyze this. No, let's still

218
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:32,820
analyze this in the ideation phase, but let's not

219
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,074
squash every idea as soon as it is being said. So seeking

220
00:14:37,122 --> 00:14:40,454
that balance between getting all the ideas out and then having

221
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:43,974
a balance within the feedback loop. So that's just

222
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:47,666
another area that it's really important to have a balance

223
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,414
in your feedback loops to create an environment where people can truly thrive,

224
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:54,810
especially specifically in that

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,234
ideation phase. So create that

226
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,390
environment where people can truly thrive.

227
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,342
Now, I began this session by talking

228
00:15:05,396 --> 00:15:09,422
about adding the personality and the relationship back

229
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:13,686
into our meetings, especially within our virtual

230
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:16,478
work right now and our remote work teams.

231
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:20,274
And it is so critical that we have a relationship

232
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:24,930
with our teams and that we can truly assess our team dynamics.

233
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:29,346
See, creativity and innovation actually goes through ebbs

234
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:32,902
and flows of individual thought and having time

235
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:36,294
for self reflection and to spend time by yourself. But it

236
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:39,366
also requires time for us to collaborate

237
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:42,300
with other individuals and to work within a team.

238
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,580
It is not a one or the other. It is actually both

239
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,310
working together. And so it's important that we

240
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,846
take the time to assess our different team

241
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:00,730
dynamics, especially within those innovation teams.

242
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,040
And you can assess your team dynamics in a few different ways.

243
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,882
So I'm going to give you a couple of different activities that we use within

244
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:12,846
our remote teams that youre can actually pause

245
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:16,094
the video right now and you can do, or you can save till later

246
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:19,542
and you can actually do within your team. Now,

247
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:23,238
whenever I am working within a team that is within a brick and

248
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:27,202
mortar institution, everyone is together and physically

249
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:31,034
close. Then I'll have people stand on different sides of the room. We'll stand up,

250
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:35,686
we'll sit down, but we can do something very similar within remote

251
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:39,334
teams. And we can do this through conference calling and through Zoom calls.

252
00:16:39,462 --> 00:16:42,766
And the first activity that I do is very simple.

253
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:46,366
See, I'll ask my team members while everyone is in

254
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:49,082
a gallery setting on zoom.

255
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:53,358
If they are youre comfortable. If they're very comfortable with

256
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:57,522
confrontation, to lean towards the right side of the screen. If they

257
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:01,186
are not comfortable at all with confrontation, lean more towards the

258
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,478
left side of the screen. And then in a snapshot,

259
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:08,150
I can get a clear idea of my team dynamics,

260
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,130
of a very specific aspect of my team dynamics.

261
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,306
Other questions I'll ask is, if you prefer phone calls

262
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:20,386
and zoom meetings, go to the right side of your screen. If you prefer teams

263
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:23,706
and emails, go to the left side of your screen. If you

264
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:27,082
are more of a morning person, go to the right

265
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:30,826
side. If you're more of an evening person, go to the left side.

266
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,270
If you prefer public praise, go to the right side.

267
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,270
If you prefer personal praise, go to the left side. Right. And so

268
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,560
I'll go through a series of these questions,

269
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,234
naturally very specific towards the actual project

270
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:49,058
that you are working on. But as a leader, this is

271
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:53,074
really powerful. And as a team member, this is really important to

272
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:57,002
know. If most of my team prefers

273
00:17:57,086 --> 00:18:00,566
emails and I'm calling on the phone every time,

274
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:04,690
then that might be a source of maybe some frustration

275
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,186
or some tension. Or if I'm scheduling all of my meetings in the morning

276
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:11,820
and everyone is more evening people or late afternoon people,

277
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,154
then this is a quick snapshot that I can use

278
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:19,702
to help be very intentional in my leadership

279
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,374
and time as a team member within my

280
00:18:23,412 --> 00:18:27,680
team. And so this can be a really great, very simple,

281
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,490
less than a minute to get can idea of the team dynamics

282
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,170
within your innovation team and within your organization.

283
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,326
That's a really quick way that youre can get those ideas.

284
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:48,002
A second activity that I use within my team requires

285
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:51,414
a little bit more than leaning left and right.

286
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:54,902
See, in this activity, I am going to ask

287
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:58,362
that everybody grab a piece of paper and

288
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:02,394
a writing utensil and

289
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,106
I'm going to leave it up to youre to be a good steward of

290
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:10,350
your time. But in this activity, I ask

291
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,906
team members to draw as many circle

292
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:18,350
item objects as they can in

293
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,406
90 seconds. So it's very quick.

294
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:25,070
You have a minute and a half to draw as many circle

295
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,660
item objects as you can. Ready?

296
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,860
Go.

297
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,210
All right. If you pause the video and did it right, then well done.

298
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,006
If you save this until later, then yeah, I really do encourage you

299
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:43,510
to do that activity. It can be very exhilarating.

300
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,254
And one thing that I do within teams is I then ask

301
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:50,634
the team members to, if they would

302
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:54,266
like they can share their results, whether that

303
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:58,246
be on slack, they can share them on Microsoft Teams,

304
00:19:58,278 --> 00:20:01,834
Google teams, they can share their results.

305
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:05,182
There are some teams that feel more comfortable just sharing the number of

306
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:09,422
I drew eleven objects. Most people will

307
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:13,086
share what they drew and my bold team

308
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:15,630
members will actually share the pictures.

309
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,620
So definitely look at the comfort level of your team members

310
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,314
generally there's actually a little bit of all three of

311
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:26,870
sharing the number, sharing what you actually drew and then sharing the pictures.

312
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,222
There's a couple of different insights that you can get about youre team

313
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:34,774
dynamics in this activity. See, more than

314
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:38,330
likely you'll have some members of your team that actually

315
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,378
drew a

316
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:48,346
lot of different circle objects and they

317
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:52,190
may have drawn 1520 different

318
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,222
objects. And more than likely those

319
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:59,934
objects that were drawn are going to be very simple,

320
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:04,334
very quick and not have a lot of detail to them. And in

321
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:07,762
the same regard, there are some people on your team that might

322
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:11,698
have only drawn six, seven, eight different

323
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:16,110
objects, but more than likely, they will be a little bit more detail oriented.

324
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,654
And so it's in this dynamic, again, in less

325
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:23,526
than two minutes, more than likely, you can get a snapshot on the

326
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:27,174
ideation process of your different teams, members of

327
00:21:27,212 --> 00:21:30,354
those that can think of a lot of different ideas,

328
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:33,786
but maybe not all of the details, all in that moment. And then

329
00:21:33,808 --> 00:21:36,810
there are some people that will think more of the details first,

330
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,034
including those details even within a time constraint, and there

331
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:44,702
isn't one that is better than the other. It's actually really

332
00:21:44,756 --> 00:21:47,662
important that you have both within the team.

333
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:51,406
And so that's a really powerful activity. Again, less than

334
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:55,234
two minutes that I do within teams to get a really

335
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:59,602
clear insight about the type of ideation that my

336
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:03,234
teams members will more than likely bring to the table as

337
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:06,902
we are doing a little bit more in depth ideation for

338
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:10,722
the actual problem that we are solving. This is just a fun activity

339
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:13,400
that we can do within our teams today.

340
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,514
The third major activity that I do within

341
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:22,266
teams to really get an assessment of team dynamics is

342
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:25,866
to have my team members pull out an index card or a

343
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,626
note card, and on one side write the

344
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:33,066
strengths or the areas of strength that they

345
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:36,702
believe that they can bring to the team. So these are

346
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:40,862
specific to the project, and these are areas that they believe

347
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:44,526
that they will be an asset to the team. And so they write that on

348
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,954
one side of the card, and then on the opposite side of the card,

349
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:52,162
I ask team members to write a strength that they really

350
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:55,090
hope that somebody else in the team has.

351
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,350
Right. So what's a strength that you really hope there's somebody else on my team

352
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,582
that can bring to this table? I'll give you an example

353
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:06,770
using myself. See, my ideation

354
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,806
is drawing 20 different circle item objects,

355
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:14,860
but none of them have much detail at all.

356
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,146
See, I am more of a visionary type person.

357
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:22,446
I can see the forest, but I don't always see the

358
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,742
trees. And so I long for

359
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:29,390
somebody on my teams to help provide that balance of someone

360
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,074
that is more detail oriented, that is really good at the follow through,

361
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:36,402
and asking those questions to get really down to

362
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,554
those details. And so I always

363
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:43,330
write on the backside that I really long

364
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,150
for someone that is detail oriented.

365
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,582
And it's in these note cards that you can

366
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:54,280
get a good idea of ways that team members will

367
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,586
more than likely complement each other in the

368
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:02,074
same regard areas in which there might be

369
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:06,314
tension and there might be conflict. And it's from

370
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:09,826
these types of team dynamic assessments

371
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,870
that I then move in to proactive conversations.

372
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,934
Now, proactive conversations is just

373
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:21,534
a very simple conversation in which I go into any

374
00:24:21,572 --> 00:24:25,074
teams at the beginning of a project, at the beginning of a new

375
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:28,366
team, or whenever I'm taking on a new client

376
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:31,060
and the conversation goes like this,

377
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:35,880
at some point in this project I'm going to fail you.

378
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,330
At some point in this relationship, there's going to be tension,

379
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:45,030
there's going to be heat. And so

380
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,246
while the emotions are low now,

381
00:24:48,428 --> 00:24:52,338
if you've done, say, the note card, if you've

382
00:24:52,354 --> 00:24:55,686
done the note card where you have the strengths and weaknesses on both sides,

383
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,758
or the strengths and the strengths you hope someone else has on both sides,

384
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:02,814
then you can even be specific and say, our emotions are low now.

385
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:06,350
But I know at some point my

386
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,886
lack of attention to some details is probably going

387
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,586
to frustrate you and

388
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:18,146
you not always seeing the big picture and the big vision is maybe going to

389
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:22,066
frustrate me, but the emotions are low now. So let

390
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,894
us proactively discuss how we're going to handle that

391
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:29,862
situation whenever it arises. Let us

392
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:33,862
set up a script of how we are going to handle that

393
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:37,834
situation. And this is a really powerful conversation because

394
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:41,702
it does a couple of things. First, it normalizes

395
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:44,380
conflict, which is so important,

396
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,714
oftentimes conflict in teams is avoided because we don't want

397
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:52,574
to admit that there was a problem. But by having

398
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:55,726
a proactive conversation, we have already

399
00:25:55,828 --> 00:26:00,090
said not only is this normal, it's actually expected

400
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,098
within our team. And the second thing is that

401
00:26:04,184 --> 00:26:08,146
it is expected and we already have a game plan.

402
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:12,146
We know how we are going to handle conflict whenever it

403
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:15,526
arises. See if you are

404
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:19,000
providing opportunities for ownership within your team.

405
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,974
With these opportunities for ownership within your team, there's also

406
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:26,466
greater opportunity for conflict.

407
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:29,990
See, innovation and healthy teams engage

408
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,654
in healthy conflict. And with a greater

409
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:37,226
opportunity for conflict comes a greater opportunity

410
00:26:37,408 --> 00:26:40,730
for conversations over complacency.

411
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,942
Say that again. With an opportunity for ownership comes

412
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:48,766
a greater opportunity for conflict. With an opportunity

413
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:52,998
for conflict comes a greater opportunity for conversations

414
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,706
over complacency. And so

415
00:26:56,808 --> 00:27:00,130
it's so critical in these times

416
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,602
that we equip and prepare our teams to be

417
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:07,990
successful to engage in that healthy conflict.

418
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,386
A few years ago, I was actually an academy football coach

419
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:15,986
or soccer coach for the Adidas game day academies and Paris

420
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:19,474
Saint Germain academies in Bengalur, India. To coach

421
00:27:19,522 --> 00:27:23,414
widely the first generation of athletes on both an elite and a grassroots

422
00:27:23,462 --> 00:27:26,858
level. I coached about a dozen teams, mostly boys with a

423
00:27:26,864 --> 00:27:30,842
few girls. And as I joined the team, I noticed that many

424
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:34,798
of our players would come and they would stand on a line, kick a

425
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:37,886
ball, wait for instruction, and they

426
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,746
would come to our sessions. They would stand on a line, kick a ball,

427
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:44,238
wait for direction. They would stand on the line, kick a

428
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:47,746
ball, wait for feedback. And while this may have been the

429
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:50,850
most efficient way to teach a skill in a game

430
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,118
scenario, it was a disaster.

431
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:56,722
Oftentimes our players would come to sessions and they would stand

432
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:00,150
in a line, they would come to games and they would

433
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,278
kick the ball perfectly, exactly the way that we taught them.

434
00:28:04,364 --> 00:28:08,114
And then before the play was even over, they would turn to the sideline,

435
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:12,074
to the coach for further direction and feedback. See, they had

436
00:28:12,112 --> 00:28:15,994
mastered the task, but they didn't quite understand how it applied to the

437
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:20,074
overall game scenario. And so we were

438
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:23,802
able to transform the way that we were training our players.

439
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:27,786
And so, rather than stand on the line, kick a ball, wait for instruction,

440
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:31,262
we provided challenges. So from here,

441
00:28:31,396 --> 00:28:34,834
kick the ball to knock down those three cones, because in order

442
00:28:34,872 --> 00:28:38,690
to do that, you're going to have to kick with power and precision.

443
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,634
So how are you going to kick the ball with

444
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:47,398
power and precision? Because in a game scenario, whenever you pass, whenever you

445
00:28:47,404 --> 00:28:50,822
kick, whenever you shoot, you're also going to have to kick the ball with power

446
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:55,266
and precision. And so youre players

447
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:58,886
tried to find the best way to kick the ball. And from this I saw

448
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:02,346
some of the most heated debates I'd ever seen amongst seven year

449
00:29:02,368 --> 00:29:05,510
olds trying to decide if the best way to kick the ball

450
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,730
was with the in foot or with the laces.

451
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,366
In reality, both ways were right. And so our

452
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:16,238
players were able to expand the

453
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:20,346
tools in their toolbox to be successful footballers.

454
00:29:20,538 --> 00:29:23,858
And it was so important for our players to then

455
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:27,954
have proactive conversations because they knew that

456
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:32,286
now they were no longer just standing in line, kicking a ball, waiting for instruction.

457
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,578
They were engaging in conversations

458
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,634
rather than complacency, and they were having healthy

459
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:43,734
conflict because they were given more opportunities for

460
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:47,394
ownership within their methods and their processes

461
00:29:47,442 --> 00:29:50,826
and their projects and their roles. We did

462
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:54,294
that by identifying the what and the why and giving opportunities

463
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:58,058
for ownership within the how. And it's so important that

464
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:01,518
we do that within our teams today. Going to

465
00:30:01,524 --> 00:30:05,950
give you one more activity that I use within teams and organizations.

466
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,302
See, I challenge teams to get a

467
00:30:10,356 --> 00:30:13,826
piece of paper and draw eight boxes. So draw one

468
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:17,650
line horizontally and then three lines vertically.

469
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,962
I'm going to give you a challenge. See, again,

470
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:26,610
you can pause the video now, or you can do this with your team

471
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,694
after this session, but I challenge you to set

472
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:34,422
your phone, set your watch to beep every 15 or

473
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:38,220
20 seconds, depending on what level of challenge youre want to take on.

474
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,930
So you have your eight boxes,

475
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,386
and I challenge you to draw a different picture of

476
00:30:47,408 --> 00:30:50,874
a dog. All right, draw a different

477
00:30:50,912 --> 00:30:54,154
picture of a dog. See, I was working for a veterinarian

478
00:30:54,202 --> 00:30:58,394
clinic, and they had a dog as a mascot,

479
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:02,526
except the dog was not smiling. It actually looked like it

480
00:31:02,548 --> 00:31:05,554
was frowning a little bit. But the customers,

481
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:09,246
they did not like the frowning dog, but they loved

482
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,930
the fact that it was a dog, and they loved the fact that the dog

483
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,298
had floppy teams. And so I'm

484
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:19,080
going to give you two minutes,

485
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:25,458
15 seconds per box to draw a picture

486
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:28,966
of a dog on each box.

487
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:32,774
As the timer beeps after 15 seconds,

488
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:36,522
you immediately move to the next box and you draw another

489
00:31:36,576 --> 00:31:39,514
dog for 15 seconds. As soon as it beeps again, you go to the next

490
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:41,886
box, and we do this over and over and over again till we have eight

491
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:44,400
boxes ready. Go.

492
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,582
Okay, either you pause the video or you so welcome

493
00:31:49,636 --> 00:31:52,446
back. If you pause the video or youre doing this at the end of the

494
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:56,594
session. See, in this situation, we now have eight

495
00:31:56,712 --> 00:32:00,866
different pictures of dogs. I will use different

496
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:04,850
scenarios depending on the problem that we're solving here. We are fixing a problem

497
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,406
so we know exactly the purpose behind our innovation. But you can use

498
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:11,906
this for design. You can use this especially on front end development

499
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:15,394
of designing new products, coming up with effective

500
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:18,130
ways to solve different problems.

501
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,962
You can use the a box challenge, usually within

502
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,170
my teams. I will then challenge team members to place

503
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,234
their pictures or their a box within a slack channel or

504
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:34,618
within a collaborative channel, so that you can then start threads

505
00:32:34,714 --> 00:32:38,506
to make comments on what you liked about certain aspects

506
00:32:38,538 --> 00:32:41,946
of different boxes. And you can pick out the best parts

507
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:45,778
of different ideation phases and come up with a better product

508
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:49,298
altogether. And again, it's a very simple way

509
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:53,218
to come up with a lot of different ideas. Depending on

510
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,642
the dynamic of the team. I will sometimes

511
00:32:56,776 --> 00:33:00,086
give this challenge, give my

512
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:03,702
teams members what we are going to be brainstorming about a couple of days

513
00:33:03,756 --> 00:33:07,346
before, because there are some people in teams that like to mole

514
00:33:07,378 --> 00:33:10,898
on the ideas a little bit longer. That way they can come to the table

515
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:14,746
with those well thought out ideas while there are other people that come to

516
00:33:14,768 --> 00:33:18,502
the table, and they are better at coming up with a lot of ideas

517
00:33:18,566 --> 00:33:21,920
very quickly on their feet. And so I will sometimes

518
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,286
send that email out early for

519
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:29,920
team members that want to spend a little bit more time thinking about

520
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,840
those different challenges that they want to take on, and then

521
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,746
we'll take all of the ideas, put them in a collaborative channel, whether that

522
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:42,370
be Slack or Microsoft Teams or whatever collaboration

523
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:46,534
software that you use or method that you use to share all those

524
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:48,360
ideas all at once.

525
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,694
And that's a really simple way that

526
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:56,294
you can again, first identify the problem, be very

527
00:33:56,332 --> 00:34:00,090
clear in identifying the problem, and then being

528
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,514
strategic in creating an environment where people can be their

529
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:06,714
most innovative self and then also take into

530
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:11,038
account the relationship side of innovation within

531
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:15,050
teams. See, relationships are so critical

532
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,098
within those team dynamics, because if you can achieve youre dreams

533
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:22,874
all on your own, then youre probably not dreaming

534
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:26,254
big enough. It all comes back to relationships.

535
00:34:26,302 --> 00:34:30,546
If you want to do something bigger than yourself, then you

536
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:34,482
have to include more than yourself. And we are in a

537
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:37,910
very unique and exciting time right now.

538
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,960
You see, in decades past, in recent decades past,

539
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,200
our creativity was really born out of opportunity.

540
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:50,646
But in this season, our creativity will be born out of

541
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:54,402
necessity. We have a new season of innovation

542
00:34:54,466 --> 00:34:57,030
and creativity within our teams.

543
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:01,054
Albert Einstein wrote that you can't solve a problem

544
00:35:01,172 --> 00:35:04,942
on the same level that it was created. You have

545
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:08,240
to rise up above it to the next level.

546
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,500
So come on, let's rise up.
