00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,234
Hi, I'm Scott Grapheus and this is what successful

2
00:00:24,282 --> 00:00:26,040
AI teams have in common.

3
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,822
From improved medical diagnosis and self

4
00:00:30,876 --> 00:00:34,322
driving cars to real time translation

5
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:38,230
of language and virtual assistants becoming genius,

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,046
artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force,

7
00:00:43,238 --> 00:00:46,666
advancing innovation and revolutionizing how we

8
00:00:46,688 --> 00:00:50,986
live, work, and interact. Those talk is about the skills

9
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:54,282
that fuel the delivery of successful AI

10
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,918
solutions. Take a quick break and mention

11
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:01,754
that for content accessibility purposes,

12
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:06,334
I'm deliberately using relatively large size fonts, whoever practical

13
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:10,242
and high contrast elements such as dark text

14
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:14,322
on the white background or those reverse and as you saw,

15
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:18,418
I'll be describing the onscreen content. There are a few slides

16
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:22,242
that may be read word for word. Most slides

17
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:25,958
I'll be either summarizing or elaborating on the

18
00:01:25,964 --> 00:01:29,846
on screen content. And we're

19
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:33,606
back. Informed by work with AI teams

20
00:01:33,638 --> 00:01:37,254
and confirmed by research from leading organizations including

21
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:40,826
Google, IEEE, MIT, Software Engineering

22
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:42,960
Institute, and many, many others.

23
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,374
Those behind the development and delivery of

24
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:51,150
life changing AI solutions, or AI teams

25
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,310
with a fusion or combination of technical

26
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:59,134
expertise, also known as hard skills, and critical

27
00:01:59,182 --> 00:02:02,926
soft skills, also known as people skills or interpersonal

28
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:05,990
skills, amongst other labels.

29
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,022
This is to give you a sense of

30
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:15,266
the different types of skills

31
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:18,950
in terms of the quantity

32
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,598
and the range against skills

33
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:25,974
for AI teams. And there are 111

34
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:30,494
here in total. And this is not intended to be an exhaustive list.

35
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:35,326
No two teams are identical with regards to the

36
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:38,746
skills that I'm showing here on this particular slide.

37
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:42,662
However, of the 111 skills,

38
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:46,306
one is paramount and one is common

39
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:49,410
amongst successful AI teams.

40
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,774
At the category level, it's soft skills.

41
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:57,638
And here's what computer world says soft skills are becoming a

42
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:01,366
key focus. This is reinforced by

43
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,870
the artificial intelligence and its impact on business

44
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,918
publication, which reports in the AI era,

45
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:13,034
soft skills are the new hard skills and rounding out

46
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:16,650
the category of soft skills. This example

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,822
here is from the United States Artificial Intelligence Institute,

48
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:24,726
and they list the different most wanted AI skills

49
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:27,760
that include soft skills at the top of the list.

50
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,706
So that's the category. The category is soft skills.

51
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:37,182
What exactly within soft skills do successful

52
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:40,754
AI teams have in common? Well, it's the

53
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:44,794
team. And that term teams can imply

54
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:48,258
and involve team dynamics, team leadership,

55
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:52,086
team development, and similar terms that are used

56
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:55,830
in the literature. IBM says the team

57
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,820
is a key driver of a successful AI project.

58
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,026
Microsoft says, don't underestimate the power of

59
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:07,642
a team dynamic. Your product becomes a result of it.

60
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:11,658
And then I have another example, and this one here is from MIT.

61
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,280
And with regards to AI, MIT says

62
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,510
competencies like teamwork are crucial.

63
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,250
So this talk will dive into team

64
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,262
development. It's the skill that's common amongst successful

65
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:31,634
AI teams and I'm going to be delivering information

66
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:35,026
that you can use based on the science of

67
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,614
high performing teams. So here are the objectives for this

68
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:42,994
talk. There are three. The first is to understand that a confluence

69
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:47,294
or a combination or a mix of skills, including and notably

70
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:49,770
team development, are essential.

71
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,954
Talk about the team development phases. Those are five,

72
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:58,874
and specifically the characteristics of each of those five

73
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:01,994
phases. And lastly,

74
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:06,366
and most importantly, usable strategies that

75
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:10,298
you can apply to navigate each those

76
00:05:10,474 --> 00:05:13,818
to improve the team's effectiveness,

77
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:17,582
which perhaps no surprise, is correlated

78
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:20,180
with happiness and success.

79
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,810
Frankly the opposite of burnout.

80
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,418
Here's the agenda, how this talk is structured.

81
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:32,274
First is the introduction, objectives and agenda,

82
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:36,360
and we're almost done with that. Next is about information,

83
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,980
a little bit about me as it relates to this talk,

84
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,962
the five phases of team development, and then

85
00:05:44,016 --> 00:05:47,674
we'll have a wrap up with a conclusion takeaway and an opportunity

86
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:51,838
for feedback. So here's some information about me

87
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:56,234
I'm Scott Rafis. I'm an agile project management practitioner,

88
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:59,786
consultant, author and speaker, and I'm the founder

89
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,950
of exceptional Agility, which is part of exceptional PPM

90
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,950
and PMO solutions. I have nine credentials

91
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,358
and my background spans diverse industries,

92
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:14,706
everything from advanced tech, entertainment to government,

93
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,774
r, D and more. And as far as those product is

94
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,958
concerned, AI would sit nicely within

95
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:25,160
advanced Tech or R and D or both of those.

96
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,862
And my work has taken me to 25 countries and

97
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:33,526
counted content for my books,

98
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:36,326
which are two. Talks,

99
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:40,254
workshops and more have been featured and used by a variety of

100
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:44,334
organizations. Here are a few and of

101
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:46,190
these I'll mention a handful,

102
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,400
Microsoft, United States Department of Energy,

103
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,730
the English Institute of Sport,

104
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,370
Yale University, Virginia Tech and

105
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,890
many others. And now we're on to

106
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,900
the phases of team development, which are five.

107
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,622
Dr. Bruce Wayne Tuckman, who got his

108
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:13,234
doctorate in psychology from Princeton University,

109
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:16,866
did extensive research on what was initially referred

110
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:20,426
to as group dynamics, and then subsequently the

111
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:24,490
terms team dynamics, group performance, team performance,

112
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,114
team development, group development. Those terms are used interchangeably in

113
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:32,190
the context of the basis of team development,

114
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,360
and he did publish his model in 1965.

115
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,738
That model is still highly relevant,

116
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:45,262
relevant and beneficial today. That's why it's central

117
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:48,530
to the discussion of team development,

118
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,994
and my talk will draw on my own firsthand experience

119
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:57,670
using this information, and it is supported by extensive

120
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,906
research and recommendations from a variety of organizations.

121
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:06,262
Earlier in this talk I showed a few examples, such as Google. You'll see

122
00:08:06,316 --> 00:08:09,914
Google here again. The point here is to

123
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:13,594
show you a sampling of

124
00:08:13,632 --> 00:08:17,846
the grand total of 117 sources

125
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,242
that were referenced and incorporated into this

126
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:25,338
talk and discussion. And I do make all those references

127
00:08:25,434 --> 00:08:28,574
available to you. I'll show you at the end of this talk,

128
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:31,200
if you're interested, how you can access that information.

129
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,770
So here I'll mention a handful.

130
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,722
I already mentioned Google, so if I mentioned them again,

131
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:42,690
but IBM, Microsoft, MIT, Imperial College

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,342
London, DevOps Institute, many,

133
00:08:46,396 --> 00:08:48,406
many others. Again, a grand total of 117.

134
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:52,438
And to underscore, because the

135
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,134
model came out in 1865, to underscore the

136
00:08:56,172 --> 00:09:00,006
continuing relevance and value of the model, this talk

137
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:03,260
is based on those 117 sources, as I mentioned,

138
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,714
most of which were published in the last ten years,

139
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:10,650
and of those, many of them in the last year alone.

140
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,642
So to introduce and navigate models

141
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:19,166
like those one on team development, I have found in

142
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:23,102
my experience that interesting visuals and practical

143
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:27,950
examples can be extremely helpful. So of the 117

144
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,558
sources, I extracted the usable practical

145
00:09:32,734 --> 00:09:35,630
information, put it into plain language,

146
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,894
and carefully and diligently incorporated it into this

147
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:43,606
presentation. So that's what I've done. But visuals are

148
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:47,590
very important. So I have found

149
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,806
that at least as it relates to this presentation,

150
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:54,730
clip art just does not work. No, clip art does not work.

151
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,810
There's no stock photos and there's absolutely no generic content.

152
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,400
It's all from me, custom, all of it.

153
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,486
So here's those phases of team development, which is

154
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:10,938
again a custom visual which gives the big picture.

155
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:15,294
As mentioned earlier, I endeavor to use wire size font

156
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:19,186
for content accessibility purposes. Here you're just getting sort

157
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:22,820
of the thumbnail view. In a moment,

158
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,934
I'll be zooming in on the content and it'll be

159
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:30,822
more readily readable at that point.

160
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:34,326
So this is just the thumbnail. But while we're here at

161
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:37,694
the top, you'll mention that across the five phases

162
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,982
of teams development, development forming, storming, norming,

163
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:44,566
performing and adjourning, there's a graph and what it depicts

164
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,214
is the general level of performance or productivity

165
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:52,218
across the five phases. Two things I want to point out here with regards

166
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,646
to the graph. One is that storming is at

167
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:59,902
the lowest and the highest is performing. And then

168
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:03,758
below the markers for the five phases, there's a row

169
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:07,246
for the characteristics. These are the behaviors

170
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,118
or what's typically seen in most teams in the respective those.

171
00:11:11,214 --> 00:11:14,734
And then below that the next row are strategies.

172
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:18,822
These are the proven strategies according to the literature and

173
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:22,434
my own experience, that can be applied to the respective

174
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,830
phase to help advance the team forward,

175
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,490
which means move on to the next phase.

176
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,102
So while talking about the phases,

177
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:37,482
I wanted a visual also to represent a team

178
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,020
because this is about people.

179
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,786
And for inspiration,

180
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:46,574
I looked to when this model came out,

181
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:50,906
1965, I didn't find anything that resonated

182
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:55,058
or was usable. However, a few years later,

183
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:59,150
1969, these characters were introduced.

184
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:03,390
So this is obviously the more modern Lego

185
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,774
incarnation of these characters. But this is a

186
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:11,490
custom photograph of relatively expensive

187
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,362
collectible figures. And I'll be using versions

188
00:12:15,426 --> 00:12:18,986
of this image in configurations as we navigate the

189
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:21,610
five phases of team development.

190
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,490
And here we are. First up is forming.

191
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,230
So this is when an example

192
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,846
of forming would be an AI team coming together for the

193
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:39,738
first time, or somebody new joining

194
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:43,498
AI team. Somebody left, somebody joined, or somebody just joined.

195
00:12:43,674 --> 00:12:47,140
So this can be a group of people who have never worked together before,

196
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,614
who have all worked together before, or some combination. This model applies

197
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:55,446
to all those scenarios. These are the characteristics, those are the

198
00:12:55,468 --> 00:12:59,126
behaviors that are typically seen during

199
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,742
the forming phase. So if you're unsure where the team

200
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:06,614
is, you can almost use the characteristics as sort of the

201
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,834
diagnostic criteria for exactly where the teams is.

202
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,420
So during forming, people are

203
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,126
displaying eagerness and socializing, and they're generally

204
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:20,714
pretty polite, sticking to safe topics. But even if

205
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:25,038
information is shared up front, even if people have worked together before,

206
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,574
even if there's a general sense there is some newness, right.

207
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:32,710
Because those is forming. And with that, it's perfectly normal,

208
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,982
according to Dr. Tuckman and countless studies

209
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:39,278
since, to have a level of anxiety and questioning

210
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:43,198
during forming, very normal. All those behaviors

211
00:13:43,214 --> 00:13:46,434
are normal and typical of forming.

212
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:50,214
So what can you do as a leader? So as

213
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:53,938
a leader, perhaps you're a sponsor, perhaps you're

214
00:13:53,954 --> 00:13:57,394
an executive, perhaps you're actually embedded, you're a member

215
00:13:57,522 --> 00:14:01,478
of the AI team regardless of your exact title,

216
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,242
right? You could be an engineer, you could be a

217
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:08,730
scrum master, or a project manager, or you could be the business

218
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,494
analyst, right? Somebody, though, can take this

219
00:14:12,532 --> 00:14:16,554
information and apply it for everyone's mutual benefit.

220
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:20,074
These are the strategies to help the team grow and advance,

221
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:22,926
and that means move on. So somebody,

222
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,370
again, doesn't matter who or what their exact title is,

223
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,650
is taking the lead and making themselves very visible and

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,198
facilitating interactions. If there's even one person who hasn't

225
00:14:33,214 --> 00:14:37,142
worked together before. And speaking of which, even if the team has worked

226
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:41,154
together before, perhaps a two minute icebreaker,

227
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:45,254
right? Icebreakers aren't just for people who have never

228
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:49,034
worked together before. They can be very helpful for teams that have worked

229
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:52,774
together before and just kind of want to have a fresh

230
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:56,826
start or a fresh perspective and learn more about each other before

231
00:14:56,928 --> 00:15:01,486
delving into the work at hand. So the

232
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:05,390
leader can facilitate those reductions provide

233
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,606
as much information as possible. At this point.

234
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,640
So many it have,

235
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,650
particularly ones that have worked together before, have a very strong

236
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,978
sense of sort of the values and the principles and

237
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:22,802
the ethics and exactly what sort of the steps are

238
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:26,754
involved and others are kind of reinventing themselves. And this applies

239
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:30,226
to all scenarios. But whatever it is that's known

240
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:34,738
to be shared upfront as quickly as possible during the forming phase,

241
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:38,486
establishing clear expectations if

242
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:42,266
there is any success criteria, such as we

243
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:45,718
need to have an iteration or whatever it's called, your organization.

244
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:49,526
Sometimes they're called R and D cycles, sometimes they're called sprints

245
00:15:49,558 --> 00:15:52,986
or iteration, sometimes they're just called a project.

246
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:56,334
It doesn't really matter what the label is, but if there is

247
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,918
some sort of this is going to be wrapping in two weeks or at

248
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:04,942
the end of the month or whatever information is applicable

249
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,186
for this team should be communicated sooner rather than

250
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:12,574
later. During the forming phase is those beginning,

251
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:16,710
so that's the best time. And whenever there's a question or concern,

252
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,390
quick response times are particularly helpful. By the way,

253
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,906
some of these strategies might seem

254
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:27,746
like they're good common sense, and I would agree if that's

255
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,878
what you're thinking. The literature says that these are the strategies

256
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:35,782
that are particularly powerful at the respective phase.

257
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:38,858
That's why they listed here, even though some of this information,

258
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:42,986
like quick response times, is just probably a good practice regardless

259
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:46,894
of what phase you're in, right? So next up

260
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:50,666
is storming and what happens during storming.

261
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:54,674
These are the characteristics of the team

262
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:59,042
typically. And by the way, there's no fixed duration for

263
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:03,346
these phases, right? A team that generally speaking

264
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:06,726
has never worked together before might be informing and

265
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:10,246
storming a little longer than a team that has worked together before.

266
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,706
But there's no fixed duration.

267
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,870
Storming can be a business

268
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,840
day or less, or it can be the entire length of the project

269
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,310
has happened. So here's the description

270
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,258
of what occurs during the storming phase.

271
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:34,442
There can be resistance and that couldn't translate potentially

272
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:39,034
to a lack of participation. There can be conflict

273
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:42,994
based on differences of opinions. And regardless of those formality with

274
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:46,466
regards to structure in the organization, there can be sort

275
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:50,274
of competition, jockeying for position. Emotions can

276
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:54,082
be, relative to other phases, relatively high. These are

277
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:58,866
normal characteristics, according to Dr. Tuckman in countless

278
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:02,534
objective studies over the decades since. What can

279
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:06,642
you do about the storming phase? Here are the strategies

280
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,182
to help those team grow in advance, which means

281
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:13,750
move out of it into those next phase,

282
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,882
requesting and encouraging feedback.

283
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:20,574
Here's what is meant by that. An example would be something

284
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:24,174
that worked out quite well with several EI things I was involved in.

285
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:28,400
And that is somebody saying something along the lines of

286
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,290
if you ever have a question, concern, issue,

287
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,418
impediment, whatever the label is, big or small, at any time,

288
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:42,286
please let me know and then give examples.

289
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:45,950
You can come into my office, you can hop on a zoom,

290
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,650
you can email me or text me,

291
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,334
right? And so you're soliciting and

292
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:56,902
inviting and encouraging feedback that will

293
00:18:56,956 --> 00:19:00,954
result in feedback. And then once you receive it, whoever that person is,

294
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:03,850
they need to acknowledge it and handle it.

295
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,482
Otherwise that person will come back with more feedback. The point

296
00:19:07,536 --> 00:19:10,662
here is that many teams,

297
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:14,206
including successful teams, for some issues

298
00:19:14,308 --> 00:19:17,806
or impediments or problems or concerns, will kind of

299
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:21,578
wait till the end when we'll cover that, but wait till

300
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,894
the end for a retrospective or a post project review

301
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:28,638
or whatever the label is at your organization to provide that feedback.

302
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,354
But you know, that could be two weeks away, it could be a month

303
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:36,054
away, it can be days away. Why not get it resolved sooner rather

304
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,870
than later? And by repeatedly,

305
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,210
sincerely and professionally,

306
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,178
politely inviting and requesting and encouraging feedback

307
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:49,414
and responding appropriately goes a real long

308
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:52,634
ways to brainstorming in those case in particular,

309
00:19:52,752 --> 00:19:55,580
and for the life of those project as well.

310
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,318
So I'm going to jump

311
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:02,794
down to the last bullet point here, building trust by honoring commitments.

312
00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:07,626
Now, not every organization uses

313
00:20:07,818 --> 00:20:11,646
agile, let's say scrum or strength. Some do,

314
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:15,154
though, so I'll just use this as an example and it would still apply

315
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:18,926
to other situations. Here would be a situation where there's

316
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,194
going to be a daily stand up, it's going to be

317
00:20:22,232 --> 00:20:25,860
from ten to 1015 local time,

318
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,874
it's going to be in person, and for people who are remote, they'll join

319
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:33,400
remotely, and it's where each person will share.

320
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,806
Typically, the points are you can do whatever you like, but they're typically

321
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:41,210
what did you do since the last meeting? What are you going to do

322
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,766
today? And any issues or impediments. Another invitation

323
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:49,986
for feedback. And it's called a daily

324
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:53,600
stand up or daily scrum because it happens

325
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,490
daily, that is, every business day. So it's inevitable

326
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,914
that for whatever reason, a meeting or two might

327
00:21:02,952 --> 00:21:06,418
get canceled over the lifespan of the

328
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:10,606
sprint iteration project program, whatever it's called. So that's

329
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:15,220
not really a problem. But what if it's a new team and

330
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,186
you have a daily scrum and the first five are canceled in a row

331
00:21:19,218 --> 00:21:23,206
are canceled. So what I'm getting at is this, and it

332
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:26,306
might seem quite obvious, but I think it really teams,

333
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:29,658
articulating and that is trust is a

334
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:33,174
very complicated thing in the context

335
00:21:33,222 --> 00:21:36,346
of team development. The most powerful thing you

336
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:40,050
can do to build an advanced trust is to honor

337
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,582
commitments. That doesn't mean you can't ever change your mind

338
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:47,534
or cancel a meeting. But honoring your commitments goes a real

339
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,680
long ways to building trust.

340
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,046
So next up is the norming

341
00:21:54,158 --> 00:21:57,538
phase. It is the second highest level from a

342
00:21:57,624 --> 00:22:01,710
performance or productivity standpoint. You can see the graph above.

343
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,366
And here is a very different visual of the team kind

344
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:08,902
of starting to kind of form some connections here.

345
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,770
That first bullet point talks about developing cohesion.

346
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,434
Here relative to earlier phases, purpose and goals

347
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:19,514
are more well understood, which can translate to higher

348
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:23,158
levels of confidence and commitment. People are engaged

349
00:22:23,174 --> 00:22:26,886
and supported, and if there was any anxiety

350
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:31,158
earlier during forming or storming, particularly storming,

351
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:35,034
which is normal, it is either lowered or eliminated

352
00:22:35,162 --> 00:22:38,766
during the normal phase. So here's what you can do

353
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:42,950
to help the team grow in advance, which means move on to the next phase.

354
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,466
That is not waiting necessarily to the end.

355
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:50,194
Doing it now would be recognizing individual and

356
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:54,110
team efforts, providing learning opportunities,

357
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,214
if appropriate, at your organization and feedback during while

358
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,526
this project or program or sprint is live.

359
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,586
And here those last point of monitoring

360
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:09,314
the energy of the team. The team is at its second

361
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:12,922
highest level of productivity. They're doing quite well. They're almost

362
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:16,780
at the highest level of productivity. If things are going well,

363
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,718
whoever that person is, they're taking a step back, right?

364
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:25,386
They're not being in the front driver's seat. They're kind of stepping back and monitoring

365
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:27,440
the energy of the team.

366
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,690
And then that brings us to forming.

367
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,410
Sorry. From norming to performing rather.

368
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,054
And this is those highest level of productivity

369
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:43,230
and performance, which according to the literature is correlated

370
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,860
with happiness and success.

371
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,746
Perhaps no surprise there very different visual showing

372
00:23:49,778 --> 00:23:53,426
a different kind of level of connections amongst

373
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:56,294
the team members. And that first bullet point speaking to it.

374
00:23:56,412 --> 00:23:59,634
Demonstrations of interdependence and self management,

375
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:03,142
sometimes called self organization. Those is

376
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:06,506
compared to the earlier phases, high motivation, trust and

377
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,894
empathy. People will typically refer to those

378
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:13,486
larger team needs versus their own personal needs

379
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:17,454
or individual needs. And just to make it clear,

380
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:21,258
the team is consistent and effectively producing

381
00:24:21,434 --> 00:24:25,262
deliverables during those phase. So here's the

382
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:29,006
strategies to help the team grow in advance. So if they're in the highest

383
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,446
level of performance, the reason, if you're

384
00:24:32,478 --> 00:24:36,322
wondering why I bring this up is because this is an open active those

385
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:39,686
until it's done, this is ongoing. So this is

386
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:42,790
to keep the momentum going, diving from the side,

387
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,194
similar to what I mentioned earlier for minimal intervention.

388
00:24:46,322 --> 00:24:49,898
Celebrating successes has different meanings of

389
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:53,786
different organizations. So you do whatever you can at your company for

390
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:57,798
the team to celebrate its successes and not necessarily waiting

391
00:24:57,894 --> 00:25:01,898
just for the end of the project program, sprint iteration

392
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:06,154
to do so, if you can, and encouraging

393
00:25:06,202 --> 00:25:09,598
collective decision making and problem solving. Having said that,

394
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:14,154
if the team is in the performing phase, they're very likely already practicing

395
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:18,162
that third ballpoint already. And then

396
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,290
that brings us to a journey,

397
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,810
the fifth and final phase of the phases of tomb development.

398
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,494
And here, even if this group

399
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:32,360
of people will continue working together,

400
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,358
this is really marking the end of a sprint iteration project,

401
00:25:36,444 --> 00:25:40,666
program, or whatever the label R D cycle at

402
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:44,442
the organization. And I'll talk more about that. Well,

403
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:48,298
right now, first of all, before doing that,

404
00:25:48,384 --> 00:25:51,694
I wanted to mention that if you come

405
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:56,474
across any sort of literature articles

406
00:25:56,522 --> 00:26:00,142
or the like talking about four phases, well, they're talking

407
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:04,498
about the 1965 model. When this model

408
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:07,566
first came out, it involved forming, storming,

409
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:10,340
norming and performing. However,

410
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,114
Dr. Tuckman and his colleague Mary Ann C.

411
00:26:14,152 --> 00:26:17,542
Jensen found a journey to be so

412
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:21,030
important that he, along with Jensen,

413
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,382
modified his own model in 1977. So since

414
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:28,790
Dr. Tuckman changed his model from four phases,

415
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,630
five phases, the model has five phases,

416
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,186
not four phases. It's important. And I

417
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:40,258
also wanted to mention here, while it's formally

418
00:26:40,454 --> 00:26:43,914
called and properly called the adjourning phase,

419
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:47,870
because that's what Dr. Tuckman called it, some people refer

420
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,922
to it as adjourning, routineing,

421
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:54,506
mourning, and have other labels

422
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:58,318
for it, but it is adjourning. I include

423
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:01,714
that just in case you come across that. So here,

424
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:06,126
in terms of the characteristics here, it varies by organization

425
00:27:06,318 --> 00:27:09,878
and the type of project or teams you have.

426
00:27:10,044 --> 00:27:13,478
But there is the potential for sadness. That's probably

427
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:17,154
why some people call it the morning those. So here's the scenario.

428
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,890
Let's picture it's more of a classic.

429
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,766
It's not typically done this way, but for illustration purposes, let's picture

430
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,686
it as a classic project that runs several months, usually shorter

431
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:33,646
cycles. And these are people who have largely not

432
00:27:33,668 --> 00:27:36,640
worked together before, and they're working very closely together,

433
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,760
and they've achieved great results. And it's the end

434
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,934
and it's time to kind of disband and go back to their regular roles

435
00:27:45,982 --> 00:27:49,374
and departments. And for people who are not accustomed

436
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:52,626
to joining teams and

437
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:56,466
the nature of teamwork, there can be sadness. And so I

438
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:59,862
just wanted to mention that the literature is quite clear that this can

439
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:04,134
happen. But there's things that you can do about this for

440
00:28:04,172 --> 00:28:07,650
everyone's benefit, for the individual, the team and the company's benefit,

441
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:11,242
which I'll be covering. Recognizing team and individual

442
00:28:11,376 --> 00:28:15,226
efforts are things that the team might do on its own.

443
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:18,970
And then if the team is temporary, it can disband.

444
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,326
And again, for even teams that

445
00:28:23,508 --> 00:28:27,386
people are going to continue working together, this phase still applies.

446
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:31,118
Here. I'll talk about strategies to help the team grow,

447
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:34,946
really those strategies to help the individuals, the team and the

448
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:39,460
company grow. So here's what can be done. Recognizing change,

449
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,350
having what is referred to as a retrospective or lessons learned,

450
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,666
or a post project review, where you can really take stock

451
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:51,320
of things and incorporating those learnings into future

452
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,146
endeavors, thereby continuously

453
00:28:56,178 --> 00:29:00,134
improving matters at the organization, which can give you a competitive advantage,

454
00:29:00,182 --> 00:29:03,606
by the way, and acknowledging

455
00:29:03,638 --> 00:29:07,718
the individuals and having some sort of this really will vary by organization

456
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:11,214
tremendously, but some sort of a party or

457
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:15,166
after party or acknowledgment by somebody in

458
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:19,486
a position of leadership or somebody on the team, and some companies

459
00:29:19,588 --> 00:29:22,414
will at least in the well,

460
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:25,778
now we're post Covid, I suppose, but pre Covid. Post Covid would

461
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,754
go out to a restaurant on the company, right?

462
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:32,254
And have a celebration or during a company meeting,

463
00:29:32,302 --> 00:29:35,486
we'll dedicate 510 15 minutes

464
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:39,430
to talk about those success of this

465
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,286
group of people, this teams, and what it means to the company.

466
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:47,382
This is also very important, as I mentioned, not just

467
00:29:47,436 --> 00:29:51,274
individuals and the people on the team, but for the those company,

468
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:56,074
for somebody, picture somebody who's not on the team and

469
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:59,034
there is a company event of some sort,

470
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:03,350
virtual or in person, and a

471
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,034
person of leadership gets up and talks about how much they appreciate

472
00:30:07,082 --> 00:30:10,350
the hard work, diligence, and what it really means to the company,

473
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,334
whether it is disrupting the marketplace or including

474
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:18,446
sales or whatever the goals were of the AI

475
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:22,414
endeavor during the respective

476
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:25,954
cycle. And people who are

477
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:29,554
obviously on the team will hear that and appreciate

478
00:30:29,602 --> 00:30:33,190
that. But it also sends a message, a very strong message,

479
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,110
to people who, to everybody, including people who were not on the team,

480
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,698
about how much the company appreciates this sort of

481
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:44,486
effort. And so celebrating the team's

482
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:48,166
accomplishments. The importance and value of that cannot

483
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:51,470
be overstated. It is extremely powerful.

484
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,014
So those are the key highlights from the five phases of team

485
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:01,440
development, and we're now transitioning to the wrap up.

486
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,614
This presentation advanced that confluence

487
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:09,522
or a mix of skills, including and notably team

488
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,866
development, are crucial to the delivery of

489
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:16,870
successful AI solutions. It is just that it's team

490
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,566
development that successful AI teams have

491
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:24,306
in common. And then the session dived

492
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:28,354
into the five phases of team development, talked about the characteristics

493
00:31:28,402 --> 00:31:32,234
of each one, and provided usable strategies for

494
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:35,482
navigating the phases from beginning to end which

495
00:31:35,536 --> 00:31:39,802
improves when applied it teams effectiveness which also

496
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:44,014
can be correlated with happiness and success which

497
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:48,190
if you apply it can give you, your teams and your organization

498
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,766
a competitive advantage. So if

499
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:55,840
you'd like to connect, I'd love to connect with you.

500
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:00,082
A lot of my information rather than listing all of my social

501
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:04,546
media accounts on the screen here I just have my website@scottgraphis.com

502
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:08,446
on my front main page are links to my different social accounts.

503
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:12,038
So I'd love to connect with you if you would. And then

504
00:32:12,124 --> 00:32:15,430
as promised, I have a takeaway. It is the main

505
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,930
visual of the phases of team development and the 117

506
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,674
sources. The references that went into this talk are

507
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:27,574
all listed in the bibliography. This is a PDf

508
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:31,210
file, so if you have to scan the code or

509
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,810
in lowercase bit Lya,

510
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,606
it may take a moment or two or three to load on

511
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:47,586
your screen and then you can save the PDF to

512
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:50,530
your hard drive. And then lastly,

513
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,686
feedback really lets me know what's working and what's

514
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:58,194
not, what you liked and what you wish I had spent

515
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:02,342
more or less time on. And so I have created a very

516
00:33:02,396 --> 00:33:06,230
simple Google feedback form with your name, your email

517
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,422
and what did you think? I think it's just three questions very

518
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:14,166
quick. So if you are interested in providing

You can scan the code or you could enter in in

521
00:33:21,472 --> 00:33:28,220
lowercase bit ly s

522
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,782
seven and then that will bring up the Google

523
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:37,662

00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:41,246
I talked about how you go to my website, but if you would like

525
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:44,686
to provide feedback after you hit those send button on

526
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:48,534
the Google form, a new page appears where

527
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:52,198
I thank you for providing feedback and I give you a link

528
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:55,958

530
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:01,570
