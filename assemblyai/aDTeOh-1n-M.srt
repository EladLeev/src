1
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,230
Today I would like to discuss with you current status and problems

2
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,322
which I see in the industrial equipment simulation software

3
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:35,622
area. First of all, I will

4
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:39,586
briefly describe the problem as I see it. To highlight

5
00:00:39,618 --> 00:00:43,302
the details, I will tell you how engineers deal

6
00:00:43,356 --> 00:00:47,480
with the equipment simulations, what they call process,

7
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,234
how different related to difficulty technological processes

8
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:56,334
can be. We will take a look what

9
00:00:56,372 --> 00:00:59,802
currently happens with typical simulation software

10
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:03,666
and its main restrictions. Also, I will describe a

11
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,926
real example of gas compressed simulation software,

12
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,626
which was implemented by me and show

13
00:01:10,728 --> 00:01:14,210
out of boundary way how it integrated

14
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,270
into existing modeling structure.

15
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,606
Last but not least, I will tell you why all

16
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:25,414
of this is important and what possibilities I see

17
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,830
in area of equipment simulation.

18
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:32,074
So let's start with problem itself. There are

19
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:36,090
a lot of industrial companies in various sectors of industry.

20
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,942
Some sectors are more advanced, some of them

21
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,998
are conservative and dogmatic, but all of them

22
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:47,726
want to be effective and successful. To do

23
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:50,000
so, they want to plan better.

24
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,170
Better company plan better. It spends its resources,

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,330
saves where it can save and spends only

26
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,154
where it is necessary to spend. Any company want

27
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:07,266
to understand its technology. Often industrial

28
00:02:07,298 --> 00:02:10,486
companies are big and complex with a

29
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,458
lot of different people involved in operation,

30
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,070
such as engineers and managers.

31
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,634
Bigger companies have very complex and often

32
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:24,458
interconnected technologies in operation, and clear

33
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,962
understanding of the underlying technology is a

34
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:30,990
key to companies successful operation.

35
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,674
During last years, there was a clear trend in industrial

36
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,710
companies to be more digital.

37
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,766
Even companies from conservative areas such as oil

38
00:02:42,798 --> 00:02:46,562
and gas, for example, cannot ignore benefits which

39
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,740
modern software can give to them.

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,850
And often when such companies faces their challenges,

41
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,760
sometimes which nobody encountered before,

42
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,346
they find that they don't have proper instrument

43
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:06,440
which can help them to solve their problems.

44
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,460
And software tools, which they have,

45
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,774
doesn't have enough features or such features

46
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:18,010
cannot be directly used in their cases.

47
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,794
In other words, industrial companies missing software

48
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:26,718
tools. But let's go a little bit deeper to understand

49
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:30,410
a problem. To get better understanding,

50
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,874
first I have to explain based terms which

51
00:03:33,912 --> 00:03:36,370
used in engineering across industries.

52
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,610
And I would like to speak about a thing we call

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,700
process or sometimes technological process.

54
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,022
In engineering. Process is a series of

55
00:03:48,076 --> 00:03:51,686
interrelated tasks, which takes something

56
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:56,198
on its input, do some transformations and

57
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:59,290
provides a desired output.

58
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,322
Processes can be very different, but all of them

59
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,586
follow this paradigm. For example,

60
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:10,690
converter on car plant takes parts

61
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,440
and assemble them into the car,

62
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,630
breweries convert hop into the beer,

63
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,510
chemical plants mix chemicals into medicines,

64
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,850
and oil plants distillate oil into petrol.

65
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,630
And all of these processes can be described and represented

66
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:35,922
as mathematical models, which later can be implemented

67
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:39,798
in related modeling software. But let's look

68
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:43,014
what we can do right now. So in

69
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:46,550
general, we are very good in mathematical modeling.

70
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,182
We have a strong knowledge of mathematics,

71
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:53,690
physics, chemistry and other sciences.

72
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,246
It is not a problem for us to do any calculations

73
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:02,506
with base physical parameters such as temperature,

74
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:06,430
pressure, flow rates, energy, et cetera.

75
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,006
We can do such calculation fast and without anything

76
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:15,006
special required, for example, using software tools

77
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,350
like Excel, especially if correlations

78
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,570
between parameters are simple and linear.

79
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,586
But also we are quite good in more complex mathematical

80
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:29,494
models, especially in well described areas such

81
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:33,634
as thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, or chemical

82
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:37,254
reactions. We start to

83
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:40,742
see some difficulties here, mainly with calculation

84
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:44,042
complexity, when our process includes many

85
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:47,514
interconnected parameters, or we have

86
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:51,214
several interconnected processes which need to

87
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:53,870
be simulated simultaneously,

88
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,062
which actually leads us to things we model not

89
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,726
so well. One of

90
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:04,690
such example is industry rotary equipment.

91
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,134
In my case, I would like to focus on a modeling

92
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:12,190
process of such equipment as a compressor.

93
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,790
If we speak about gases or pump in case of liquids,

94
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,710
compressors and pumps are quite similar machines with

95
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,886
common principles, but everything I say also

96
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:28,262
applies to any other complex industrial

97
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:29,690
rotary equipment.

98
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,650
For better understanding why compressors are so difficult

99
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,374
to simulate, I shortly will tell you about its structure

100
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:42,110
and application. So the main

101
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,694
purpose of pumps and compressors is

102
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:49,374
to increase pressure of medium. Process of

103
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:52,534
increasing the pressure is used in various applications,

104
00:06:52,682 --> 00:06:56,366
starting from quite simple air conditioning,

105
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:59,700
where relatively small machines are used,

106
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,700
and goes up to natural gas transportation processes,

107
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,442
where series of huge machines which has physical

108
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:11,062
size of typical country house do

109
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:14,598
a lot of compression work. Such machines differ

110
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,966
in structure and in size, which is measured

111
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:21,530
in maximum consuming power, in watts.

112
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,310
And since this is an active equipment

113
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,958
which consume power to do work, it is

114
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:33,360
always accompanied with some kind of engine,

115
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,040
electric motor or gas turbine, for example.

116
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,594
But if the main process of such machine is just an increasing

117
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:45,330
of pressure, which is one simple physical parameter,

118
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,490
why is it so difficult to simulate it in software?

119
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,570
The answer here is variation.

120
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,058
So due to nature of such equipment,

121
00:07:57,234 --> 00:08:00,534
the process cannot be stable every moment of

122
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:04,374
time. There are a lot of parameters change

123
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:08,122
every moment of time, and pressure is only

124
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:12,362
one of them. Each model of such machine has

125
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:16,838
its own unique fingerprint, a chart

126
00:08:16,934 --> 00:08:20,746
called performance curves. This is a chart

127
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:24,654
which includes ranges of various parameters such

128
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:28,446
as pressure ratio, flow rates and power

129
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:32,062
calculated for specific impeller and for

130
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:35,234
specific rotation speed. Change of

131
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:38,466
rotation speed parameter leads to change of the wall

132
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,922
map and all interconnection of

133
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:44,180
parameters will also change,

134
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,882
all of this multiplied by all possible variations

135
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,054
in hardware designs. And do not

136
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:55,686
forget that machines can run in parallel or in

137
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,620
series influencing each other.

138
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,762
So literally it is almost impossible to do

139
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:06,314
universal software solution. But is

140
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,100
it really that nobody tried to do so?

141
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,080
Actually, not really.

142
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,094
There are process simulation software exists and

143
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:21,390
some of tools are actually very powerful,

144
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,822
but usually not with rotary. They help engineers

145
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:29,842
to do quite complex calculations. But I see one big

146
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:32,210
issue here, flexibility.

147
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,930
First of all, almost all such software

148
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,150
are proprietary with closed sources.

149
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:45,074
If you want change something in the way how it simulates

150
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:47,990
your equipment, no, you cannot.

151
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,650
Often such software do a lot of simplifications and

152
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,294
also do not pay any attention to rotary equipment

153
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:59,580
complexity. What companies can do,

154
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,042
they can write messages to support with request to implement

155
00:10:04,106 --> 00:10:07,978
required changes and wait for next visionis version,

156
00:10:08,154 --> 00:10:12,160
sometimes for years. Or there is another option.

157
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,990
Try to implement its own model and software

158
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,898
and sometimes find very unintuitive ways

159
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:24,530
how to embed it into existing modeling infrastructure.

160
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,454
Here I want to show one example. I worked

161
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:32,150
in company which had a complex simulation model of

162
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,350
all assets in the one of its projects.

163
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,814
There was no problem with simulation of any equipment

164
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:43,782
except rotary. To do precise calculation

165
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:47,850
we had to implement our own Python software

166
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,202
which made a precise modeling of particular installed

167
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:55,850
compressor type. I had to investigate

168
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,054
what can be simulated in each part of

169
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,554
the machine. Since it was a series of

170
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:06,558
huge 16 mw machines driven by gas turbines

171
00:11:06,654 --> 00:11:11,010
with various impellers installed. I had to find proper

172
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,754
mathematical models for each part as well

173
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:18,534
as find their correlations. All this work

174
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:22,182
was implemented in separate Python models which

175
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:25,702
later was combined. At the end,

176
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:29,654
my software were able to calculate precise fuel

177
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:32,810
gas consumption per machine in all

178
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,078
apparition range by approximation of performance curves,

179
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:41,082
converting apparition parameters to required calorific

180
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:45,150
value through mechanical and heat power and fuel gas consumption.

181
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,962
The funny thing was that it was also possible to interconnect

182
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:54,318
it with petroleum expert software through interface

183
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,902
called Openserver from their site, which originally

184
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,650
was used only to extract some reports.

185
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,186
Our software led us to do precise prediction

186
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:11,494
of compressor power consumption, which is actually a

187
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:15,670
company loss on fuel gas. And actually

188
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,140
this leads us to the question,

189
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,890
why is it important? Actually the

190
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,650
demand of such precision is questionable until

191
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,250
you don't try to look for long term planning.

192
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,382
There can be situations, especially on very big

193
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:37,690
and long processes, when cumulative

194
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,470
effect of nonoptimal operation can

195
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,580
lead to significant losses of money later.

196
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,530
For example, here is a chaos of

197
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,570
typical oil and gas production profile.

198
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:56,550
It shows how much product will company get during

199
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,066
its operation time. On this chart,

200
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:03,638
company plans to operate for 20 years,

201
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:07,160
which is quite normal for typical oil and gas project.

202
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:11,654
Blue line here shows overall production figures

203
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:15,670
without any losses in real operation.

204
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,046
Some of product is used for own consumption,

205
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:22,986
for example for energy generation or as a fuel

206
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:24,350
for compressors.

207
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,838
Currently companies just take some fixed percent value

208
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:33,522
and deduct it from overall production to get final

209
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:37,060
figures. It is shown by orange line.

210
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,994
The issue here is that condition of

211
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:45,258
operation will definitely change a lot. And without precise

212
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:48,870
modeling there definitely will be an error.

213
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,554
The green line here represents simulated results

214
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:57,614
and all the difference between green and orange lines

215
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:01,446
on chart is actually potential money losses

216
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:04,842
due to incorrect planning, which actually can

217
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:07,818
be avoided. For the first view,

218
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:10,970
the gap between lines is not so dramatic.

219
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,446
But don't forget about cumulative effect and the

220
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:18,062
scale. Often we are speaking about

221
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:21,200
up to hundreds of millions dollars per year.

222
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,358
What is important here? This effect can be seen

223
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:29,202
already on the middle of the project life. And you can

224
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:32,914
see this time point as blue vertical line on

225
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,406
chart. Also there are another important

226
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,640
time point exists in any such project.

227
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,022
The moment when you have to stop your production so

228
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:47,854
called abandonment phase. Any production

229
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:51,802
in this phase cannot be profitable in any

230
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:55,482
way. So you are interested to start

231
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,940
the construction works as soon as you get to this point.

232
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,720
Otherwise you just will lose money.

233
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,710
Without precise simulation, you can miss this time point easily.

234
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,142
It is clearly seen on the chart as it's shown by two red

235
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:15,902
vertical lines. For almost a year,

236
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:19,730
company's cost will be higher than profits

237
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,140
in total. It's not only lost money,

238
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,270
but also additional and avoidable spends.

239
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,680
So in a nutshell, there are options.

240
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,750
Companies can do simple use,

241
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,390
conservative approach and mostly likely

242
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,674
lose some millions in future. Or if

243
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:45,654
they want to be safe, they can do investment in modeling

244
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:49,258
software development now and save a lot money

245
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:52,782
later. As a conclusion, I can say that

246
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:56,670
I see a great potential in modeling software development.

247
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,766
There are a lot of blank spots on this market

248
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:04,670
and definitely more discussions are required.

249
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,470
I personally would like to see more movement from industrial companies

250
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,070
to open source world and vice versa.

251
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,206
I hope this presentation as well as described experience

252
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:21,334
can be as such step. So thank

253
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:21,780
you very much.
