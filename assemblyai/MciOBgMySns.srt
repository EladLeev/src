1
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,570
Okay, welcome again to my talk on Nebulous. I'm at operating system for broken

2
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,110
hyperdistributed applications on cloud computing continuums.

3
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:40,214
The talk that I wish to deliver to you today is

4
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,538
titled have your head in the clouds while keeping your feet firmly

5
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:47,026
on the ground. And I'm Rodosov Pirisic from seven bullscom

6
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:50,622
and this is my email address at the bottom. The project

7
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,670
that I'm about to describe is funded by the European Union and

8
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,886
the title. While the only connection between the title and the

9
00:00:57,908 --> 00:01:01,806
project is the word cloud, you will see from the

10
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,634
presentation that this title is actually pretty relevant to the

11
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:09,794
concepts that I will be showing you as both having

12
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:13,650
your head in the clouds and keeping your feet firmly on the ground

13
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,414
makes sense in the various contexts that

14
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,760
will be discussed quite soon.

15
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,170
Okay, so without further ado, let me show you the agenda.

16
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,254
So this is the agenda of today's presentation. First we'll

17
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:33,254
discuss the concepts, the concept of the cloud continuum.

18
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:36,794
Why do we need cloud continuum? How does it

19
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:40,746
relate to other concepts that are found, commonly found in

20
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:44,682
discussions like that? Then we'll discuss what a meta operating

21
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:48,126
system is. I will introducing the nebulous project and give

22
00:01:48,148 --> 00:01:51,358
you various details on this project. We'll also have a

23
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:54,286
sneak peek into the nebulous architecture that we are planning.

24
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:57,758
And finally we will have a summary

25
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:00,420
of the contents of this talk.

26
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,674
So, regarding the cloud continuum per

27
00:02:04,712 --> 00:02:08,066
se, this is very important. This is actually fundamental

28
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,518
to this project. This actually

29
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:16,230
has been defined now. So the cloud continuum,

30
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,740
this term has been used in various ways,

31
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,902
obviously for the purpose of a common ground.

32
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:28,470
I'm introducing it now in this form following

33
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,758
the paper with Moroskini from 2022 actually Morriskini

34
00:02:32,774 --> 00:02:36,206
atal. It was published in IEEE access and the

35
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:39,450
authors provide the following definition of cloud continuum

36
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,514
that this is an extension of the traditional cloud towards multiple

37
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:47,258
entities, and the examples given on Edgefork IoT

38
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:50,286
and this dimensions provides analyzes, processing,

39
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,926
storage and data generation capabilities.

40
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:54,500
So basically,

41
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,640
if we actually translate it, transform it into other form,

42
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,974
the continuum of something is an extension of something, right?

43
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:07,366
And these case this is a cloud continuum. It's an extension of the

44
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,386
cloud and towards some other entities that are

45
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:15,174
relevant in this context. So like in this context of having computation

46
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:18,682
somewhere else, these is Edgefalk Iot, and we'll also

47
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:22,218
see it more detailed on some other slide.

48
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:25,886
What I wanted to underline actually did on the slide is the

49
00:03:25,908 --> 00:03:28,718
data, and this is actually very important.

50
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:32,090
That data is what is describing the computation.

51
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,602
Actually all the kinds of efforts that

52
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:38,930
are being made in that it's actually

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,354
no computation without the data. All right, so we'll see

54
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:45,926
that in a moment as well. But first of all,

55
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:49,638
why cloud? Continue? Why do we even study such a

56
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,960
thing? Why is cloud not enough?

57
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,400
So if you are practicing cloud,

58
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:03,354
you probably already know that cloud is not

59
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:06,714
a solution that will cater to all and every need

60
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:11,566
that your application, that your infrastructure, that your solution service

61
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,934
might have, right? First of all, we know that these

62
00:04:15,972 --> 00:04:21,018
applications themselves, these know no boundaries. Like they don't

63
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:24,802
actually care unless they were written in such a way

64
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:29,026
that they have to run in the cloud. Like for

65
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:32,590
example, we see this lift and shift approached,

66
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,966
that people are just moving applications naively, let's say,

67
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,582
into the cloud, and probably also taking

68
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:44,470
the cost of doing that this way. But nonetheless,

69
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,746
applications, no boundaries, they don't care.

70
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:51,290
These prefer that they have scalability.

71
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,118
It's good for the operations to have the using capabilities.

72
00:04:56,214 --> 00:05:00,338
So cloud is actually good for that. So considering

73
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:04,554
the continuum from the perspective of having some other resources

74
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:09,198
and joining those to the cloud, you enable yourself to

75
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:13,094
utilize the semifinals,

76
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:16,798
let's say almost finite, less resources

77
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:20,382
of the clouds, public clouds.

78
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:24,306
So usually when I just say cloud, I will mean the

79
00:05:24,328 --> 00:05:30,674
public cloud, as we see that offers us the infinite

80
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:34,342
amounts of

81
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:38,406
processing power. So the

82
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:41,882
cloud might not cater to all the requirements that apps may have.

83
00:05:41,936 --> 00:05:45,686
So you might have some technical constraints and non technical constraints

84
00:05:45,718 --> 00:05:49,862
that are either hard to achieve with a cloud solution. With a cloud

85
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:53,886
only solution, for example, remaining the

86
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:58,270
technical constraints, your latency and bandwidth requirements might

87
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,806
be such that the various ways that you need

88
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,906
to transfer your data, it might not

89
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:09,198
be sufficient to have all your computing

90
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:12,914
put into the cloud. You might also be using some

91
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:16,790
specialized hardware, I don't know, maybe FPGA. You are doing

92
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,854
some scary new algorithms that are optimized for some

93
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:24,726
FPGA, and you actually need to

94
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:28,150
utilize that software to stay competitive

95
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,814
with other competitors. And similarly,

96
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:37,130
you have the IoT.

97
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,006
Generally you cannot directly connect the IoT to

98
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:47,886
the cloud. You do it via some other means, via some other

99
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:51,374
intermediate provider. Of course you can connect

100
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:55,380
it directly to the Internet and then reach out

101
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,666
almost directly to the cloud, but this is usually not the case

102
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:03,458
because of the various ways that you would like to process

103
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:06,920
your data. And this is actually very

104
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,002
relevant to the latency and bandwidth that I discussed

105
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:15,638
a moment ago. Similarly, on the side of

106
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,222
the non technical constraints, when you are considering compliance

107
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:24,410
with the various policies like the european GDPR,

108
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,246
the California CCPA, and the other global

109
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:31,550
ones like PCI, DSS and HIPAA, that is,

110
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,614
I think, mostly United States. And you might also

111
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:39,694
have some internal business compliance. And in

112
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:43,554
cases like this, cloud providers usually provide

113
00:07:43,752 --> 00:07:47,838
some way to help you with ensuring

114
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,362
the compliance with the policies that

115
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:55,910
they are at least aware of. But in some cases,

116
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,102
it might actually be the case that you need to keep your

117
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:06,054
data off the cloud, like it shouldn't be conducting the cloud

118
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,930
in the first these, at least not in some anonymized,

119
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,900
cleaned up form. Right?

120
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,030
And in these cases, the cloud only solution

121
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,280
might not be the best one.

122
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,914
And considering the actual current landscape

123
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:30,030
of how companies are behaving towards the clouds,

124
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,142
we know there are companies that have still not migrated to the cloud,

125
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:37,806
that they

126
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:42,530
run off their data centers, they use collocation services, or otherwise

127
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,860
avoid the cloud at the moment still.

128
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,522
But some of them are looking for a solution

129
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:53,234
that will help them to utilize the cloud and do it properly,

130
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,646
not just going with the lift and shift approach, which most companies

131
00:08:56,748 --> 00:09:00,922
have already learned the hard way that this is going

132
00:09:00,976 --> 00:09:04,154
to introducing a lot of cost for not

133
00:09:04,192 --> 00:09:06,540
that much gain out of the cloud.

134
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,042
And they would also like to keep their current investments.

135
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:15,966
So they already put some money in

136
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,534
the existing infrastructure, and it doesn't make sense to say

137
00:09:19,572 --> 00:09:23,006
that, well, this is all obsolete now, let's throw it away.

138
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:26,100
Well, using backs is no good for a company.

139
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,970
And some other companies that, like I mentioned already,

140
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,554
that have learned these hard way that the cloud is

141
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:37,474
costly, they are actually looking for an optimized way to utilize

142
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:40,982
the resources in the clouds, as well as looking

143
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:45,046
for some insights, whether some

144
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:49,898
of the workflows that they have would better be made

145
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:53,302
running on some other kind of infrastructure,

146
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:56,598
rather than using the clouds,

147
00:09:56,614 --> 00:10:00,714
the public clouds. And the

148
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:04,198
underlining aspect to all of that is

149
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:07,520
we could answer the y cloud continuum, because data,

150
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,158
now we hear the terms the

151
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:16,106
big data, the Internet of Things, the IoT, the industrial

152
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:19,490
Internet of things, et cetera, that produce

153
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,220
a lot of data.

154
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,374
And considering these computation in general, when you

155
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:29,560
think about that, even if you consider a game,

156
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,782
it's always processing some data. So in case of a game,

157
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:37,282
of course, this is like processing the interactions,

158
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:41,258
the human interactions, against some

159
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:44,986
world state. And basically, this is your data. So the

160
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:49,078
world state and the interactions that happen to it, consider a constant streams

161
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:52,762
of changes to that world, being it

162
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:56,414
a multiplayer game or a single player game. Of course, for a single player game,

163
00:10:56,452 --> 00:11:00,000
it would be on a local machine only because it doesn't make sense

164
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,280
in general to centralize it.

165
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,554
But also in all other cases, you can

166
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:11,106
actually define what data is like. For example, if the user has

167
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,660
a form, then the user is inputting some data into the application,

168
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,854
into the services, and you can also get

169
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:22,706
the data from other sources, like the devices, the sensors.

170
00:11:22,738 --> 00:11:26,994
So you either have a human or you have a non human source

171
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:30,374
of your data, which creates some data provenance,

172
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:34,774
of course. And further,

173
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:38,294
this data that you gather, that you generate, that you obtain,

174
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:42,170
needs to be stored somewhere. It's either stored transiently

175
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,046
while it's being worked on. So this is in the

176
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:49,486
working memory usually, and it can also be

177
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,330
stored persistently. So this is most often these

178
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,042
storage that we think about, that persistent storage that

179
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,526
doesn't get cleaned

180
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:03,854
up after some thing fail or distributed,

181
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:07,062
et cetera. Then we have the state of the data

182
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:11,222
that had been transferred. So it's being in transit between two

183
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:15,106
computing nodes that they need to communicate this data to carry

184
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:18,410
out comparison. Or maybe the other node is going to actually

185
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,538
store the data in some persistent way. And finally,

186
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:26,380
of course, the thing that

187
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,354
takes the most of the computing power is the actual comparison.

188
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:34,350
So we know that of course the various chips

189
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,146
need to be working for the generation,

190
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,186
for the storage, for the transfer, of course. But the

191
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:47,330
actual processing is the thing that is

192
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,702
consuming the computing power. And similarly

193
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:54,274
to the generation and obtainment of data.

194
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:57,574
In this case of processing and analyzing data, it can be either

195
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:01,014
human driven or automation driven. So either

196
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:04,642
it's human doing some computations like running the comments,

197
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:08,838
various comments and describing some results

198
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:12,554
in excel, for example, in excel like

199
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:16,060
software. So the spreadsheets or

200
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,086
automation driven, like it's a workload, it's a service that has been

201
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:24,910
programmed to do something this way. And this is the computation.

202
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,658
And by adapting cloud continuum,

203
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:35,730
what we are allowed to do is we can optimize

204
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,482
these flow, the data flow, the way that we act

205
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:43,778
upon the data. And two

206
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,306
these we can achieve the best utilization of available resources.

207
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:52,418
Like the slide says, in that if we disregard

208
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:55,622
the fact that we might have some better

209
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:59,450
environments, some better place to carry out these operations,

210
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,010
we are actually disregarding some optimal solution

211
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,442
that is impossible when using just

212
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:12,526
the cloud. Like I mentioned already with the IoT case,

213
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:16,110
it might make sense for various reasons to process

214
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,662
the data closer to the IoT device, rather than

215
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:23,600
trying to stream all the data directly to the cloud.

216
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,706
And where might this continue live? So like mentioned before,

217
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:34,194
we have these public clouds. And these

218
00:14:34,232 --> 00:14:37,746
is fundamental for the cloud continuum,

219
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:40,934
because in the name you have the cloud. And basically this is

220
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:44,294
usually consider a public cloud. Of course there are

221
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:47,882
private clouds, but they're comparison to data

222
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:51,466
centers like these really differs in the

223
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:58,362
way that you manage your resources. But this

224
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:02,206
doesn't usually meet the definition of the cloud, as it's for

225
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:06,414
the public cloud, with the resources being almost

226
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:09,470
finite, less, and so on and so forth.

227
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,046
In these case, this is often called the fog.

228
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:17,250
So the layer between the edge,

229
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,246
the IoT devices and the public cloud is the fog.

230
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:25,466
So whatever we put there, our data centers either managed

231
00:15:25,598 --> 00:15:29,302
in a more traditional way or a private cloud way, like with

232
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:33,462
Openstack or some other cloud solution from another

233
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,886
provider. And then

234
00:15:36,908 --> 00:15:40,234
we have, apart from the cloud, from the fog, we have

235
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,450
the edge. And in case of edge

236
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,834
also, there are multiple ways to look at it. Either you

237
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:51,654
consider the edge sites, which look like these data centers,

238
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,214
but they are actually smaller usually than

239
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:58,686
the fog like data centers. So this is also

240
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:02,734
often called the micro data centers. We have

241
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:06,590
also a similar concept with the multi access edge computing,

242
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,160
which is what these telco providers provide,

243
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,490
offer to the users,

244
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,942
in that it's similar to the

245
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:21,158
public cloud, but running on the telco devices. So usually

246
00:16:21,244 --> 00:16:25,314
the public cloud providers don't run the telco,

247
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:29,018
so they don't operate at the level of the

248
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:32,102
end user network, but in the case of telcos,

249
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,194
they can do that. They actually do that.

250
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:39,002
And this offering of multi access edge computing is

251
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:41,040
also what is happening now.

252
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,714
And similarly closer with each step, it's closer

253
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:49,280
to the potential resources of your data,

254
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,570
with the final destination,

255
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,330
with the actual source of the current big

256
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,182
data, let's say, is the IoT devices. So the devices

257
00:17:01,246 --> 00:17:04,850
that are usually not equipped with so much computing power,

258
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,374
maybe they have some computing power, but generally not as much

259
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:12,182
as a typical server that is being deployed in data

260
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:16,294
center, but nonetheless, they are there and they're important

261
00:17:16,412 --> 00:17:17,960
sources of the data.

262
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,746
And regarding the other concepts I

263
00:17:22,768 --> 00:17:26,694
mentioned in the agenda that are often discussed

264
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:30,798
together with cloud continuum, and that they have been mentioned

265
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:35,086
much, many more times than cloud continuum so

266
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:38,606
far, because they are older terms, they are

267
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:41,854
also often mentioned now by these

268
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:45,554
public cloud providers, and as they offer the solutions to

269
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:49,694
the multicloud and hybrid cloud approaches

270
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:53,698
to cloud. So in case of multicloud, what they usually

271
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:57,074
mean is that you will have two or more public clouds,

272
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:01,142
right? So pick two major cloud

273
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:04,966
providers and they will probably have a service to make it easier for you

274
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:08,950
to use their services to connect their networks, et cetera, et cetera.

275
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,514
Regarding the hybrid cloud, it's similar, but it says that

276
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,746
you would have this public cloud and not a public cloud. So this is

277
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:20,554
what makes it hybrid, because it's not really one type

278
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:24,222
of the cloud. Like in the case of multicloud. So we have all of them

279
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:27,614
public. In this case you have one public, the other one is not

280
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:30,974
public. And like I mentioned previously, it could be the case

281
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:34,418
that the other hybrid part is not actually

282
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,570
a typical cloud. It's not even managed like a cloud.

283
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,538
It's just your data center. It can act in a

284
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:44,180
similar law, it usually falls in this.

285
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,726
And finally, this is like a generalization of this

286
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:52,182
concept. So you have the cloud continuum when you just go

287
00:18:52,236 --> 00:18:56,054
mix and match as you wish, as it suits your solution, as it

288
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:59,382
suits your product that you're trying to deliver.

289
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:03,226
All right, so finishing with

290
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:07,322
the cloud continuum now, a little slide of the meta operating system.

291
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:10,974
So since you are here, you probably know

292
00:19:11,092 --> 00:19:15,200
the operating system definition, at least at these very,

293
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,190
let's say shallow even level, but generally know what an operating system

294
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,780
is. And these Wikipedia gives

295
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,610
these definition that matches it very well what the operating system

296
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,694
does. It manages the computer hardware,

297
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:35,402
software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

298
00:19:35,566 --> 00:19:39,522
And if you go and try to recreate the meta operating

299
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:43,560
system by studying what the meta means, in this case

300
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,034
the meta from the greek meta, so meaning

301
00:19:48,082 --> 00:19:52,570
after or beyond is a prefix remaining more comprehensive or transcending.

302
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,970
And these, if you build these definition of a meta operating system,

303
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,226
which is at the moment not that well defined in general in

304
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:04,374
the literature, you get this definition

305
00:20:04,422 --> 00:20:07,470
of a meta operating system. This is system software also,

306
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,458
but this manages sets of computer resources.

307
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:14,786
So you have more than one computer,

308
00:20:14,888 --> 00:20:18,254
more than one source of computer resources,

309
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:22,222
let's say. And still this system software

310
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:26,086
provides common services for computer programs running on them.

311
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:29,654
So you pluralize this, you layer it on

312
00:20:29,692 --> 00:20:33,430
top of the existing operating systems and this gives it

313
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,280
the meta flavor of an operating system.

314
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,610
And this is basically the goal with the project that I'm about to describe.

315
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,450
And here it is. Here is the intro to the nebulous,

316
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,254
nebulous as it has been shown on the very first slide on the title

317
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:50,998
slide is actually a name for a meta operating system for

318
00:20:51,024 --> 00:20:54,426
brokering hyperdistributed applications on cloud computing

319
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,774
continuums. So we have discussed the meta operating system, we have discussed the cloud

320
00:20:57,812 --> 00:21:01,466
computing continuums and what we haven't discussed is brokering

321
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:05,182
hyperdistributed applications. But of course it's been

322
00:21:05,236 --> 00:21:08,994
all the time in the background when we discuss that we have the

323
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:12,606
data. The data is being operated on by the services, by the applications,

324
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,210
in other words by the programs that are running there.

325
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,606
They're distributed because they can run on more than one computer.

326
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,094
These is where it comes so we have actually already mentioned that and

327
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:26,774
they're hyper distributed just means that well this is going the

328
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:29,914
hyperscale, right? So like not the two

329
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:35,738
computers in one room, but going over distances over many

330
00:21:35,824 --> 00:21:39,270
components in that and brokering. So suggesting

331
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,166
the optimal solution, finding the

332
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:47,038
proper way, the optimal way to actually utilize those

333
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:52,254
various resources. So we have also mentioned that and

334
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:55,646
nebulous is a consortium project, so it's

335
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:59,422
funded by the European Union and its consortium. Actually consider

336
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:02,740
of 16 organizations, we have both academia and business,

337
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:06,994
we have both tool providers and consumers which provide these use cases.

338
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:10,806
The schedule is as follows. We have three years for these project

339
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:14,774
and it's quite new. The link

340
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:18,466
is nebulouscloud EU. I invite you to visit

341
00:22:18,498 --> 00:22:22,074
this site for more details, but I'll try to provide some more

342
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:25,830
for you already. So these are the logos of the various

343
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,830
partners in the consortium. You might recognize

344
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,706
some of them, you might not, but for the details on them please visit

345
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:38,686
these site. And this

346
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:42,470
is one of the slides that tries to describe how nebulous

347
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,186
is being imagined. So what

348
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,414
we already discussed is cloud continuum.

349
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:54,206
So you have resources that are in various

350
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:58,274
places, you have the public clouds, your private clouds or otherwise

351
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:01,970
your major data centers, let's say you have your edge devices

352
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,510
that are those micro data centers, at least you consider

353
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,010
them to be on the edge of your solution.

354
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,506
So closer to the actual sources of the data you have at the

355
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:15,674
bottom, your IoT devices, so they can

356
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,782
also count as edge devices, but they don't have that much computing power.

357
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:23,898
And what you want to do is that for your particular solution,

358
00:23:23,994 --> 00:23:28,814
you want to have an ad

359
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:32,362
hoc infrastructure solution, right? So for your software solution,

360
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:36,302
for your product solution, you want an ad hoc infrastructure

361
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:39,742
solution. Your ad hoc cloud computing continuum

362
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:43,666
designed specifically brokerage specifically for your

363
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:46,120
use case for your application.

364
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,966
So mix and match whatever you want. And also, as I

365
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:55,074
mentioned previously, that telcom providers with their multiple

366
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:58,170
access edge,

367
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,826
these own private data centers that are very close to

368
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:06,140
the end user connections are also

369
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,054
to be selected by such a project,

370
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:15,034
right? Okay, so regarding

371
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,734
the various details on the nebulous project, regarding development at

372
00:24:18,772 --> 00:24:22,270
resources, the nebulous will be developed in open

373
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,906
and it will be offered as open source software and the license will be

374
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:30,290
Mozilla public licence version two. So this is a very liable

375
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:34,322
license, you might know it already.

376
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:38,646
It's similar to the approached license, but it differs in

377
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:42,006
a few bits. So for those interested, you might look it up on

378
00:24:42,028 --> 00:24:45,382
the Wikipedia. The development platform is

379
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:47,800
yet to be discussed again because,

380
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:53,194
well, this is, sorry. So it's yet

381
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:56,540
to be discussed because you are previewing this

382
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,794
from the recording. I will probably know by the time

383
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:04,254
you are watching this. So you can reach me on the discord or

384
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:07,678
via my mail or otherwise via the project website.

385
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:10,414
But at the time as I am recording this,

386
00:25:10,532 --> 00:25:14,190
this is not yet fully established,

387
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,180
so bear with me for that.

388
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:22,354
But also I would like to mention that nebulousness is not only about

389
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:26,034
the software that we are producing. So there will be software deliverable,

390
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:30,098
these will be something to plug and play, to configure,

391
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:34,600
run your software, et cetera. But we are also producing other

392
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,014
resources, other deliverables, as we say,

393
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:42,140
what we do. We have the open access research,

394
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,506
we have the cloud continuum culture, dissemination, this being a part of

395
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:49,834
it. We have training that we offer, and we

396
00:25:49,872 --> 00:25:53,294
also have a relevant open call that I will

397
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:54,800
describe in a moment.

398
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:01,114
And regarding the directions of work that we take in nebulous,

399
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:06,706
these are the directions of work. These were also included in

400
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:10,018
the description of

401
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:13,714
the talk that I'm giving now. So first

402
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:17,894
of all, this way to model the

403
00:26:17,932 --> 00:26:22,150
actual applications that consider the full cloud continuum,

404
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,434
cloud computing continuum, including the folk and edge

405
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:29,946
aspects as I described these before. This will

406
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:33,542
be research and solution to do that properly

407
00:26:33,606 --> 00:26:37,654
will be described. Again. This will consider both the infrastructure

408
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:42,186
that you can offer, that you

409
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:46,026
have, that you offer to your application by means that you have it,

410
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:50,334
that those that you would like to use from the public cloud providers and

411
00:26:50,372 --> 00:26:54,242
telco providers, but also apart from the infrastructure, you give

412
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:58,126
also the application requirements and the details

413
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:02,180
on the data streams that you will be using

414
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,920
with your application. So the data will be driving that.

415
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,934
And similarly you

416
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:20,346
define this. We give you a way to define that so

417
00:27:20,368 --> 00:27:24,054
that the platform can assure the quality of service that you desire

418
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:27,674
and also optimize it. So the next

419
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:31,226
bullet point regarding the optimization, so that it actually selects

420
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:34,734
the resources that work best for your

421
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:38,960
particular use case. Third bullet point

422
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,474
considers that

423
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:47,166
it's important to not forget the security aspects

424
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,702
of doing that. So whatever you encode

425
00:27:50,766 --> 00:27:54,942
in the application specification should

426
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:59,106
be transferred, should be materialized

427
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:01,750
in this cloud computing environment,

428
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,654
in this cloud continuum environment, in such a way that it

429
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:11,434
still considers the security aspects, that the final solution is

430
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:15,098
actually secure by all means. And final

431
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:18,426
bullet point this is something novel that we are

432
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,966
also trying out. This is

433
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,360
not per se,

434
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:30,426
let's say, specific to cloud continuums, but generally

435
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:35,394
for the services that are being offered is

436
00:28:35,592 --> 00:28:39,410
the monitoring and conducting those smart contracts

437
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,906
based service level agreements. So the

438
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:47,894
service level is not only realized by its

439
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:51,538
textual form that is being analyzed interpreted

440
00:28:51,554 --> 00:28:55,154
by humans, but it's also automatically monitored,

441
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:59,306
recorded, and its violations are detected in

442
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:02,890
a smart contract way. Right. So this is also

443
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,362
some relevant aspect that we are pursuing in this

444
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:10,880
project. And the open call that I mentioned

445
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:16,494
earlier is that we have this

446
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:19,822
amount of euro in the fund for nine

447
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:22,910
grants and this open call will open in 2024,

448
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,354
actually. And what the

449
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:29,746
open call gives you if you decide to join it and if

450
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,074
you actually win this call is that you will

451
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:36,574
be given the opportunity to discover these software, to roll

452
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:40,114
out your software, your solution on the nebulous

453
00:29:40,162 --> 00:29:43,480
platform that we'll be delivering, and you will help us.

454
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:47,826
So you will join this in the middle of the project and by joining

455
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:51,258
it you will also help us build a better product

456
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:54,314
by the end of the nebulous project.

457
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:59,894
Right. This is one of the newest additions,

458
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:04,720
let's say, to the european project and

459
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,390
finally going something a little more

460
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,990
into the architecture, into the technical

461
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,886
side of the nebulous platform regarding

462
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:21,570
the architecture assumptions. So what the nebulous tries to do

463
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,850
is obviously tries to support the scope of the project.

464
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,066
This is like paramount that we support what the

465
00:30:28,088 --> 00:30:31,506
scope of the project is in

466
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:34,822
a very coarse grained way at the very high level.

467
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:38,780
Let's say I have already given you a description of the scope of the project

468
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,490
by all the slides, by all the previous slides,

469
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,986
and this is generated direction so that it's going

470
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:50,302
to cope the various ways to cater for

471
00:30:50,356 --> 00:30:53,630
those requirements in the scope.

472
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,854
Then the other assumption is that

473
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:01,550
we support the use cases of nebulous. I'm not introducing those

474
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,886
because I don't realms have time in these relatively

475
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,620
short talk, let's say.

476
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,882
Well, maybe not relatively short, but not long enough

477
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:16,406
to really discuss every little detail that is relevant to

478
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:19,718
the project that I'm describing. So for details on

479
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:23,538
the use cases, and there are various, please visit

480
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:25,910
the website that I mentioned previously.

481
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,442
And the other bullet points speak

482
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:34,326
about the technical, actual selection of the components

483
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:37,866
that would be used in these open source software on

484
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:41,322
nebulous. So we are reusing the open resources software

485
00:31:41,386 --> 00:31:46,746
as much as possible that we have already been contributing

486
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:50,314
to in various ways or using in various

487
00:31:50,362 --> 00:31:53,722
ways. So first of all, these open resources components of multi cloud

488
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:57,550
platforms that exist already from the other european projects,

489
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,586
for example, these melodic functionizer who have already been completed as

490
00:32:01,608 --> 00:32:05,474
well as the morphemic that is nearing its completion

491
00:32:05,522 --> 00:32:10,726
now, but it's still work in progress and

492
00:32:10,908 --> 00:32:14,738
on the side of orchestration like the consider

493
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:18,486
whatever orchestration that you can do with Kubernetes. And I said on

494
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:22,074
the slide and more, because with Kubernetes you can actually do more than

495
00:32:22,112 --> 00:32:26,154
just orchestrate. And the last bullet point is actually all about

496
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:30,570
that. What we want to offer to the end users

497
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,186
is that they have this user friendly, declarative,

498
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:38,314
reproducible and GitHub friendly as well, app modeling

499
00:32:38,362 --> 00:32:41,902
in Yaml so that it's not

500
00:32:41,956 --> 00:32:45,650
scary, it's something that the entire

501
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,362
industry is adopting at the moment, right? So having

502
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,610
it GitHub's way, having it reproducible,

503
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,690
having declarative,

504
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,862
basically making manageable realms

505
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:02,470
manageable for the end user.

506
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,326
And our approach is very much inspired and based on

507
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:10,170
Kubernetes custom resource definitions with custom controllers.

508
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:14,054
So we have been inspired by the existing crds

509
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:17,674
and we are basing our solution on crds and

510
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:20,974
the custom controllers that we will provide, that we will

511
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:26,926
develop in these very project and

512
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:30,606
these sneak peek into the nebulous architecture. So like I mentioned,

513
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:34,546
this is still early and we don't have

514
00:33:34,648 --> 00:33:38,034
many details to show you. Sorry for

515
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:42,066
that, but I'm really open to discussing that with you

516
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:46,726
via mail or via discord while I'm there by

517
00:33:46,748 --> 00:33:50,454
the way, I will try to be there, but my

518
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:54,200
time zone might actually prevent me to be active at all times

519
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:59,226
during these actual event. But feel welcome to leave

520
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:03,500
me a message or just leave me a mail and

521
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,914
I can certainly talk about it

522
00:34:07,952 --> 00:34:12,894
a bit more. And regarding the

523
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:16,926
sneak peek into the architecture in

524
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:20,830
the center, we have this cope that is Kubernetes driven

525
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,590
that provides the various services for the

526
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:28,910
actual implement, for the actual realization

527
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,178
of an application on this meta operating system.

528
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:35,750
At the top we have the users who provide, as I mentioned already,

529
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,366
the available infrastructure description, the application

530
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:43,154
description, the data streams description, and the goal

531
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:47,206
of the meta operating system is to realize the application in

532
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:51,398
the MOS optimal way using the resources that are available and considering

533
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:54,810
these various constraints that have been given in the various descriptions

534
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,180
from the user. All right,

535
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,222
so without really going into the details of the various points,

536
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:05,774
you can see that on all

537
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,766
the sites of the site of the public cloud, the private cloud,

538
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:13,134
otherwise some data center and also the edge fog nodes,

539
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:14,500
wherever these are,

540
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,622
we consider that there will be another local Kubernetes

541
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:25,414
cluster that will be somehow federated with

542
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:29,670
the main cluster and via this federation

543
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,190
as we call it now, we will opensource that the workloads

544
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,430
that are meant to be running in the target environment

545
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,990
actually running there. So it's like a two layer orchestration

546
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,382
for the nebulous meta mos where the core layer

547
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:51,194
decides on the first level of the orchestration and

548
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,240
then the second layer decides on the others.

549
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:59,626
Furthermore, we are discussing considering various elements

550
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:03,474
of fault tolerance, like if one of the

551
00:36:03,592 --> 00:36:06,610
sites is actually disconnected from the core,

552
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:12,706
how should it be final that the site should still

553
00:36:12,808 --> 00:36:17,366
keep on using and optimized locally for

554
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:20,854
the resources that are available for the site, for the resources that

555
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:24,486
can still run to some extent, like degraded more or

556
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:28,138
otherwise for this local

557
00:36:28,224 --> 00:36:31,420
site, whatever that use case is. All right,

558
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,674
so things like that is what is the scope of this

559
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,938
particular project? First step is of course,

560
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:43,246
given definition of that, what are the

561
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,686
exact details, how we want to approach that? And this is still in

562
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:52,686
the talks, so that's what we are doing very

563
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:56,260
much at the moment, that we are actually spending lots of time on that.

564
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,746
Well, that's basically it. What I had to

565
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:05,300
tell you about the nebulous project and its state at the moment.

566
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:10,950
And this is what I have a summary for you from this presentation.

567
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,166
So I won't be reading it for you because

568
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:19,414
you can pause the video, it's pre recorded if you want the

569
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:20,840
summary. Actually,

570
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:28,054
the summary is bulletization of all

571
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:31,802
the most important points from the entire presentation

572
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:36,478
that I would like you to somehow remember and keep

573
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:40,814
from this particular talk. And with

574
00:37:40,852 --> 00:37:44,094
that said, thank you very much for

575
00:37:44,132 --> 00:37:47,022
having me and for hearing me out to the end.

576
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:50,410
