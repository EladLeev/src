1
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,372
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. Whatever time of day it happens

2
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:22,640
to be for you when you are watching this video from comp 42 SRE,

3
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,208
this is my talk on implementing a learning team, and it's

4
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,428
a case study of a situation that occurred a number of

5
00:02:29,434 --> 00:02:33,236
teams ago when I was working at LinkedIn that I

6
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:36,476
think you can identify with. And I hope that you'll be able to benefit from

7
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:40,348
the approach that we took, even if the specific principles are a

8
00:02:40,354 --> 00:02:43,992
bit different. First off, I'd like you to imagine

9
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:47,836
that it is 05:00 a.m. 06:00 a.m. Your time

10
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:51,312
locally, wherever you are, and you get

11
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:54,640
an important email from the CEO that says,

12
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,210
hey, some numbers don't quite look right.

13
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,332
We have at LinkedIn this lovely report,

14
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,340
which yes, I realize is a bit of an eye chart.

15
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,804
We called it those key business metrics, and this

16
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:15,272
would come out every hour. It lagged real time by two

17
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:19,444
to 4 hours by the time different cleanup processes

18
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:23,412
had been run on it. And our CEO

19
00:03:23,476 --> 00:03:27,560
was unique in his capability for pattern detection.

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,496
He would look at this and let me zoom

21
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:34,828
in on those a little bit for you. It's an hourly report

22
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:38,476
covering the last 24 hours for a

23
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:42,210
handful of crucial activities that would occur on the site.

24
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,072
Page views is one of them. And then I've just labeled the others as

25
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,976
activities one through eight. And you can see that when

26
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:54,916
you compare week over week that a number of these are

27
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:58,660
down, a number of them are up, the patterns don't quite match,

28
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,150
but that's where the red and the green came in.

29
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,080
And this contrasted to the

30
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,504
metrics that engineering would typically look at.

31
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:14,840
Engineering would look at these metrics that are on 1 minute intervals.

32
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,764
They would lag real time by about five minutes compared to the key

33
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:22,750
business metrics that would lag by two to 3 hours.

34
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,548
And this example from the ingraphs shows,

35
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:32,144
obviously a place in time where

36
00:04:32,342 --> 00:04:35,536
we had less activity than the

37
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:38,976
previous week, comparatively. And so this would be

38
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:42,672
the kind of thing that would often get flagged in the key

39
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:46,052
business metrics. The question that would come up,

40
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,444
and this occurred, of course, right as the shift would

41
00:04:49,482 --> 00:04:52,884
change. We has teams that were geographically spread on

42
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:56,170
both sides of the world about by 12 hours.

43
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,456
And the question would come in just as one team was

44
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,610
about to go away and the next team was coming on.

45
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,596
The incoming team, of course, had very little context at

46
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:10,750
the time. The outgoing team wanted to head home.

47
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,268
And the question of, hey, what's going on?

48
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:18,348
Would come up. And being, as it was,

49
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:22,560
important and of course related to, as I say, key business metrics.

50
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,330
People would want to jump on this and understand what's going on.

51
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,740
So the teams would scramble around trying to answer the question

52
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,476
right at the top of the shift change. And it

53
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:39,190
was not an easy thing to do. We were

54
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,508
figuring out what was going on, and every time

55
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:48,100
we would come in and look at it, we'd have to potentially

56
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,360
consider a plethora of different systems that were affected.

57
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,628
So what to do about those well

58
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:01,224
being engineers and from an engineering

59
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:04,830
culture? Our first idea was, hey,

60
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,336
let's get more data and let's analyze

61
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:13,036
the heck out of it. So we came up with an approach,

62
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:18,108
an idea of going with a Holt winters seasonality.

63
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:21,916
Because the idea with Holt winters is that it can identify

64
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:25,316
multiple periodicities in the data. If we

65
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:29,044
can predict, trend wise at greater detail,

66
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:33,172
what should be happening, then that should give us a better insight as to what

67
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:37,128
might be going wrong. As you can see here

68
00:06:37,294 --> 00:06:41,160
with an overlay from a sample chart,

69
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,860
it's not so easy effectively,

70
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,820
and the variations are still pretty extreme

71
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,496
and don't lend themselves to answering

72
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:57,870
the question of what's gone wrong.

73
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,696
Those problem in this scenario is that we have a

74
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:07,360
lot of different systems that go into these key activities.

75
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,376
They could have been emails that were being sent out,

76
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:15,760
and maybe something went wrong with the send, maybe it went out late,

77
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,612
maybe it went to the wrong people, maybe something

78
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:24,420
was wrong with the site and people couldn't get in and perform the key activities.

79
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,228
Or maybe the page latencies had changed due

80
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:31,144
to some change that had been shipped out.

81
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:35,064
It's really difficult to answer these questions off

82
00:07:35,102 --> 00:07:39,080
the top of your head because there were so many factors

83
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,750
that could have gone into it. So,

84
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,750
needless to say, our idea of getting more data,

85
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,588
diving into the data with more detail and attempting

86
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:54,240
to predict just wasn't breathing fruit.

87
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,416
So we took a step back and we got the

88
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:02,508
teams together and we said, okay, let's see if we can equip

89
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:05,910
the teams, both the outgoing team and the incoming team,

90
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,956
to be able to answer these questions. Let's start by answering the

91
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:13,030
questions. We'll figure out how to automate things down the road.

92
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,156
So we started off with what I call calibrating

93
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:21,096
the intuition of the teams. We got the

94
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:24,484
teams from the two different geographies, plus kind of an overseeing

95
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:28,812
team together, actually keep practitioners from these

96
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:32,750
and said, let's all get on the same page as to what

97
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,004
could be happening, what is happening, and how

98
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:40,300
can we tune our intuition to match our CEO's

99
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,384
intuition so that we can be ahead of the game and

100
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:48,304
say, hey, we saw this and here's the reason,

101
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:51,856
and you don't need to worry. That was ultimately what

102
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:55,276
we wanted to be able to answer. Or, of course, if there was a real

103
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:58,176
problem, then we wanted to be able to send that off to the correct teams

104
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:02,544
to address. So we started with a regular weekly meeting,

105
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:05,530
of course, with teams that are split by 12 hours.

106
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,400
This wasn't an easy thing, necessarily to do,

107
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,996
but we got together, we went and combed

108
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:16,776
through last week's data. Each week we would get together, we would

109
00:09:16,798 --> 00:09:20,124
look at the past week's data, and we would bring the

110
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:23,852
insights from everybody on the project team together to

111
00:09:23,906 --> 00:09:26,830
say, what did we see? What did we miss?

112
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,992
And then look at why did we miss it?

113
00:09:31,126 --> 00:09:34,896
What did we not know that would have allowed us

114
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:38,432
to answer the questions in the moment

115
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:41,924
if we had known it? So those is really in a

116
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:45,652
joint cognitive system. This is improving the common

117
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,884
ground amongst the practitioners, making sure

118
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,164
that the people who are involved are talking,

119
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:56,344
starting from a common place that we know both

120
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,896
the performance of the system as

121
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:03,448
well as the first and second order contributors to

122
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:07,224
how the system is performing and what could be impacting

123
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:10,844
these results. We also found a very

124
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:14,940
important thing that needed to be considered were environmental aspects,

125
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,136
being a global service. And of

126
00:10:19,158 --> 00:10:22,816
course, people interact with a service when

127
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:26,576
they're awake, not generally, unless they're a bot or a

128
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:30,272
scraper, are they operating outside of their

129
00:10:30,326 --> 00:10:32,230
normal daytime hours?

130
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,432
Also being work oriented,

131
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,950
a professional network, as LinkedIn is,

132
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,376
people would tend to interact with the service quite differently

133
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:47,080
if it was a holiday from work, if it was,

134
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,800
for instance, the recent Memorial Day holiday.

135
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,250
The performance and the activity from those United States

136
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,980
on Monday, when it was a national holiday in the United States,

137
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,544
would be very different than the performance, for instance,

138
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:05,148
from Canada or for Europe, where there is no holiday and

139
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:09,292
normal behaviors persist. The United

140
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:12,684
States would be quite different on a holiday

141
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:16,124
that's just for the United States. So we had to become aware of those holidays

142
00:11:16,252 --> 00:11:19,756
and whether or not they were going to be impacting people's

143
00:11:19,868 --> 00:11:23,636
use of those site on a

144
00:11:23,658 --> 00:11:25,220
global basis.

145
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,940
Interestingly, we even found such

146
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,444
anomalies as the

147
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:38,084
performance of sporting events would cause anomalies

148
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:41,960
in the system. This is a graph from a talk that was given

149
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,016
a couple of years ago from one of my colleagues, where he looked

150
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:51,164
at the performance of the site in the context of

151
00:11:51,282 --> 00:11:54,696
the United States Super bowl. It turned out that the Sharks were also playing,

152
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:57,100
which is a local sports team from San Jose.

153
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,224
But you can see significant anomalies at key points

154
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,952
in the game as it

155
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:09,516
applied. This was on a Sunday. Super Bowls

156
00:12:09,548 --> 00:12:13,268
were always on Sunday in the United States. But we would also find similar

157
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:17,350
things for the World cup, whether that was in

158
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,004
football or cricket. Of course, those things

159
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:26,232
affect different geographies and have differential impact by different

160
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:29,736
countries. So it was an interesting

161
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:33,160
challenge, to say the least, to understand how these

162
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,730
different aspects play out against each other.

163
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,352
So, having calibrated the intuition

164
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:45,148
of the folks on the team, we started

165
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:48,568
off to take dual control

166
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,484
in a sense, such as this airplane.

167
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:55,420
We wanted ultimately to get everybody flight qualified.

168
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,424
We wanted every individual engineer that was doing

169
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:02,704
the on call response to be able to successfully

170
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:06,164
fly the plane and answer the CEO directly without having

171
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,460
to escalate or cross check their answers.

172
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,052
But we started off with an experienced engineer leading and

173
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:18,052
taking points, so to speak, and responding to the CEO,

174
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,948
but at the same time having other learners,

175
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:24,650
not just on a weekly basis, but in real time.

176
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,740
Okay, what do we think? Okay, here's the answer.

177
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,030
Let's formulate it and send it off.

178
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,744
After a bit of time and people feeling greater

179
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:38,030
comfort in taking the lead on these things,

180
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,050
we would have the initial response written by

181
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,540
one of the first line engineers,

182
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,704
but then reviewed by the experienced engineer before sending it off.

183
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:54,484
That worked. We continued this for a couple

184
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:58,192
of more weeks, a number of more incidents effectively

185
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:01,776
coming along. And then we went moved

186
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:05,720
to learners. The initial learners were leading.

187
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,736
Their responses would be monitored by the experienced engineer who would

188
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:12,936
provide offline feedback to the

189
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,650
learner saying, hey, you could have tightened this up here.

190
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,620
Did you consider this? And essentially doing

191
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,430
has close to a real time feedback has possible.

192
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,836
Ultimately, we got to the point where our first line engineers were fully

193
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:33,296
flight certified. They were able to

194
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:36,524
take control, to jump

195
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:40,464
in, make their responses. And what

196
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:43,956
was really the best over

197
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:47,764
a little additional time is that they got to the point where they were able

198
00:14:47,802 --> 00:14:51,460
to anticipate most of

199
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,500
the questions that were coming from the CEO.

200
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,776
They would be able to say, hey, there's a holiday in

201
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,504
India today. And as a result, the traffic from

202
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,880
India is going to be significantly anomalous,

203
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,112
or there's a significant holiday across Europe,

204
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:13,260
continental Europe, for example. And so during

205
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:16,236
the hours of X, Y and Z,

206
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:21,360
traffic is not going to match last week's traffic.

207
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,412
With this success, we were able to back off on the calibration meetings.

208
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:30,364
We were able to drop it down from meeting weekly to meeting

209
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:34,004
every other week, and then once a month. And then

210
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:38,032
ultimately we were able to discontinue the calibration meetings

211
00:15:38,096 --> 00:15:41,908
because with the full flight certification, so to speak of the team,

212
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,840
they were able to do this,

213
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,632
and anticipating these problems made

214
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:52,312
everybody much happier because there wasn't a huge scramble to deal

215
00:15:52,366 --> 00:15:54,170
with problems at the end.

216
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,430
Now, over time,

217
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,484
automation was built in order to help.

218
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:07,390
So we started off with

219
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,880
understanding what was going on in the environment

220
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,784
thanks to time and date. I have a link to this at the end

221
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:20,480
of those slide, we were able to get a picture of

222
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,164
holidays around the world. Now, what this

223
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:28,384
doesn't tell you is whether or not the holiday matters to people's

224
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:31,190
behavior on a professional networking site.

225
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,056
That's something that we had to learn, what the key holidays were

226
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:39,896
and whether or not it was significant enough to have a

227
00:16:39,918 --> 00:16:43,480
measurable impact on these key business metrics.

228
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,308
The other automation that was developed over time was

229
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:52,764
involved, called Third Eye, and third eye has

230
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:56,728
been open sourced by LinkedIn. I also have a link to some blog

231
00:16:56,824 --> 00:17:00,192
posts which link to the GitHub repositories at the end of those

232
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:03,596
talk. And this is an example screenshot

233
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:07,010
from one of the blog posts which shows that

234
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,000
based on a number of different dimensions

235
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,180
in the data, we see in this example here

236
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,720
that the iOS presence is dramatically

237
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,680
negatively affected and maybe something

238
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,344
was broken, maybe direct links for iOS were

239
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:32,440
broken. This is all hypothetical, but the result on

240
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,608
key business metrics is notable and negative.

241
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:40,812
And so with the third eye tooling, those team

242
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:44,492
was much able to drill in much more quickly and

243
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:48,204
understand the dimensions that mattered, whether it be by

244
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:51,664
country, whether it be by platform, or a number

245
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:55,280
of other factors that affected how

246
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,450
the performance of the system came out.

247
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,100
I wanted to recap this

248
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,604
a bit. It did take some

249
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:13,124
time for this automation to come along,

250
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:17,208
and with time the team was able to

251
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:21,608
successfully continue their tradition of working

252
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:26,292
effectively and answering these questions largely before the

253
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:30,012
CEO was asking them, which I consider that a huge

254
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,740
success. Now, how does this

255
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,324
whole system work from

256
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,680
a learning team perspective? Because those

257
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,560
learning team is a group of directly involved engineers,

258
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,040
participants, operators. Whoever is involved, it might be

259
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,024
product managers for that matter, or business analysts

260
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:57,172
who get together and encounter the same

261
00:18:57,226 --> 00:19:01,092
problem from diverse perspectives and figure,

262
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:05,784
but through that diversity, how to

263
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:09,480
address it. So this fits perfectly with

264
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,840
a group learning model called as Reds.

265
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,360
We came together as a group with joint purpose.

266
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,670
We sensed gathering insights from everybody in the group,

267
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,488
what was going on and how we could potentially respond.

268
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,636
We developed these plans, those response plans for the next time, and it

269
00:19:28,658 --> 00:19:32,528
never took more than a couple of days before we would have an opportunity

270
00:19:32,694 --> 00:19:36,396
to experiment with one of these response plans.

271
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:39,904
With some other anomaly in the data, we were able

272
00:19:39,942 --> 00:19:44,260
to observe the effect of the responses and meet

273
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,036
in our continued calibration meetings to understand how

274
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:52,212
to fix and respond to make better our

275
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:55,716
responses, we were able to refine these plans

276
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:59,304
and collaborate on a continuing basis. At the same

277
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:02,856
time has tooling was being developed now? The tooling did take

278
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:06,792
three or four years to come into play.

279
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:10,584
If we has had to continue to scramble several

280
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:14,252
times a week for three or four years without having a good

281
00:20:14,306 --> 00:20:18,700
answer for the CEO, that would have been a terrible experience for everybody involved.

282
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,292
Ultimately, we were able to share outside of the non

283
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:27,292
project team to the wider group of on call engineers

284
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:31,104
who were fielding these things and dealing with the key

285
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:35,184
business metrics data. And the larger

286
00:20:35,232 --> 00:20:38,496
team was up leveled because of the work of this core

287
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:42,324
project learning team. I want to

288
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,840
point out in summary,

289
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,170
that resilience is already amongst you.

290
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,808
Even if your technology is not doing

291
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:56,216
what you need it to do. If it can't answer the question because of too

292
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:59,310
much ambiguity, trust in your people.

293
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,420
They have encountered it, they have dealt with it.

294
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,004
While they may not know all of the pieces, if you get

295
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:11,616
people together and they work on it together, then they

296
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:14,960
can figure it out. So learning teams

297
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,388
bring you several steps closer to the characteristics

298
00:21:19,484 --> 00:21:23,600
of the operating patterns of what are called high reliability organizations.

299
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,716
There are five main characteristics that I won't go into right now,

300
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:31,376
but four of the five are covered by a learning team. They increase

301
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,920
the awareness of the imminence of failure so that you become

302
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,520
aware and attuned to failure and you can capture

303
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,772
the instance early and not get caught

304
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,840
afterwards having to respond.

305
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,630
They recognize the practical expertise of the people at the front line

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,236
and this is really important because the people who have their hands in

307
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:58,030
the game are the ones who are best equipped to answer problems.

308
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,004
It builds in a commitment to resilience amongst

309
00:22:03,052 --> 00:22:05,330
those team that was working together,

310
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,628
different people from different organizations

311
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:13,412
and different geographies, all working together to solve this one

312
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:16,816
joint problem. This brings resilience.

313
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:20,448
It enhances people's

314
00:22:20,624 --> 00:22:24,136
self awareness of their own resilience and the resilience of

315
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:28,424
their teammates and brings this way of working to

316
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:33,080
a higher level and actively seeking diverse opinions

317
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:37,628
in dealing with these problems and how to respond to them is a

318
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:41,180
great way to make people feel included.

319
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,260
Frankly, learning teams exemplify

320
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,584
at LinkedIn, our priority for having

321
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:53,824
those talent is our most important priority and

322
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:58,140
technology is second. And when you're doing reliability

323
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,984
engineering or resilience engineering, don't forget

324
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:06,388
the people. Don't forget that your talent is your number one value

325
00:23:06,554 --> 00:23:10,036
and the technology is in service of

326
00:23:10,218 --> 00:23:14,372
the teams that bring the value. I have

327
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,716
some resources and links here. I think the slides will be

328
00:23:17,738 --> 00:23:21,668
available afterwards if you want to know more about any

329
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:24,836
of the content that I mentioned. Thank you

330
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:28,600
for joining me here at comp 42 SRE

331
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,280
and enjoy the rest of the conference.
