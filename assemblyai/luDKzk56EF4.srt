00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,946
Hi, everybody. I'm Alex. I lead the data science

2
00:00:26,978 --> 00:00:30,982
and analytics team here at Kando, and I'm very happy to be

3
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:34,114
with you today at this year's edition of Python

4
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:38,982
Web conference, presenting what we do

5
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:42,230
today with data, science and algorithms,

6
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,482
kando machine learning, in order to generate intelligence

7
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,966
in the wastewater. So I want to begin

8
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:53,466
in by breaking these words down a little bit. So what's

9
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:56,638
wastewater intelligence? Right. So,

10
00:00:56,804 --> 00:01:00,042
wastewater, I think most of us know, right? We use the restroom,

11
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:03,854
we use the sink, we use a shower. Water goes down the drain. Boom,

12
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:07,602
success. Wastewater created. That's one part of it. The other

13
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:12,878
part is maybe less familiar to some of us is what's

14
00:01:12,894 --> 00:01:16,610
called industrial wastewater. Industries everywhere

15
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,802
use water just like we do, and some of them use water in their processes.

16
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:25,106
And after these processes are complete, water finds

17
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:28,314
its way into the wastewater collection system,

18
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:32,010
where it needs to get treated. Now, these processes

19
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,642
can be such that they

20
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:39,446
introduce various pollutants into the wastewater,

21
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:43,342
which is typically okay. The wastewater facilities know and are able to

22
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:46,174
deal with those pollutants, but every now and then,

23
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:50,170
pollutants exceed either types or various

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,542
limits, and then they are potentially very detrimental

25
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:58,482
to processes. We'll talk about that also in a few words soon

26
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:02,258
enough so we understand wastewater a

27
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:05,794
little better. Now, what's intelligence? What information

28
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:09,574
are we looking to get from our wastewater? So one

29
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:12,886
piece of information is to understand what's going on,

30
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:16,518
right? The whole system is underground. Right. We're mostly oblivious to it.

31
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:19,526
We have no idea what's going on there. So initially, we want to be able

32
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:23,018
to understand what's taking place. Then we want to be able to understand

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,634
whether or not something out of the ordinary is taking place.

34
00:02:26,832 --> 00:02:29,754
And once we understand points one and two,

35
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:33,514
we would very much like to be able. By we, I mean wastewater

36
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:36,686
treatment facilities that need to do something with

37
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:39,966
whatever it is that's coming their way, they need

38
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:43,506
to be able to understand what steps they can Kando should take in

39
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:47,298
order to mitigate whatever potential damage is coming right now or

40
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,940
that has happened sometime in the past.

41
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,234
Okay, so why is the whole thing interesting? Right?

42
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:58,774
You might ask legitimately, do we really need to know this?

43
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:02,262
So, first of all, I think that specifically now,

44
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:06,086
with global warming, climate change, et cetera, I don't really need to

45
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:09,206
convince anyone that water is important. So we are all aware

46
00:03:09,238 --> 00:03:12,966
that water is a very finite resource. And specifically,

47
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:17,050
drinking water or water that we, as humans can use is

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,410
rare throughout the world. Kando. It's relatively scarce,

49
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,662
and at least I've learned over

50
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:28,874
my relatively short, safer now at can that treating

51
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,486
wastewater is a very complicated process. It's typically combined

52
00:03:32,538 --> 00:03:36,462
of multiple steps. Each one is responsible

53
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:40,420
of addressing one type or another of

54
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,082
either pollution or contaminant that is taking place

55
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:47,654
in the wastewater. So getting water from

56
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:51,574
being a waste to actually being usable again, either for

57
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:55,090
irrigation or just for reintroduction into the water cycle,

58
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,454
is a very, very delicate and nontrivial

59
00:03:58,502 --> 00:04:02,378
process. So a

60
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:05,846
lot of the events that can be introduced into the wastewater,

61
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:09,930
as I mentioned previously, by various industrial facilities,

62
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,398
are able to damage this delicate process and either render the

63
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:17,870
wastewater treatment facilities themselves, in extreme cases,

64
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,234
in operational, or just cause degradation

65
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:25,922
in the effluent water quality. So the water that is

66
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:29,394
later used to irrigate our crops or

67
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:32,494
that is introduced into reservoirs,

68
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,730
rivers, oceans, et cetera, is polluted,

69
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,910
basically hurting all of us, Kando, our lives

70
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,018
in day to day. So what do our users

71
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:47,958
need to know when Kando is providing this platform? What is this platform

72
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,498
telling the wastewater treatment facility? So, first of all,

73
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:55,274
we're informing, or we're ideally informing them

74
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:58,538
that something is happening, right? So be aware that there is

75
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:01,806
an event taking place or there is a disturbance in

76
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:05,866
the force somewhere throughout the collection system, either somewhere

77
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:10,190
close to the producer facilities or somewhere further downstream.

78
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,606
Then we need to be able to tell them what it is that's

79
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:18,350
happening, right? So the event is of such and such category

80
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,410
type intensity, what the pollution is, ideally,

81
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,154
what is the potential damage of this pollution. And then

82
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:30,726
just as importantly, if we're able to, we need to tell

83
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:34,274
them where the pollution is coming from. And this is important for two reasons.

84
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:39,146
First of all, they need to be able to kind

85
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:43,526
of verify that this pollution makes sense in terms of the pollution

86
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,722
source. Kando. The other, much clearer, is that this is their

87
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:51,454
way to prevent this from happening in the future, right?

88
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:55,582
So once they know which facility is causing such

89
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:58,798
or other pollution event, they're able to contact the

90
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:02,254
facility, make sure that the processes that take place

91
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:06,226
in that facility are correct and that the treatment or pretreatment that

92
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:10,562
needs to happen to whatever water is being discharged into

93
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:14,034
the waste is taking place.

94
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:17,494
And lastly, if there is something illicit going on or

95
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:21,510
some malfunction or something that needs to be addressed

96
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,826
more severely, then there are, of course, legal kando regulatory

97
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:29,794
approaches that can be taken. But in order for them to be applied,

98
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:33,260
we need to know, or they need to know who to apply them to.

99
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,514
Okay? So fine. I gave a very nice

100
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:40,506
elevator pitch of what can do is and what it does, and it took me

101
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:43,190
a good several minutes, and now you all know, and now you all want to

102
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,126
buy one of our systems and install them in your homes and be happy with

103
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:50,106
them, of course. But this is a machine

104
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:53,570
learning kando data science trap. So what are our machines learning?

105
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,540
What is the data science here?

106
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:02,846
So let's

107
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:05,780
start with addressing our data sources, right?

108
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,014
The first and kind of probably easiest to understand is just open

109
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:15,234
source data, right? So when we deploy our system at a specific location,

110
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:18,906
we need to be aware of where it is, where deployed, what is

111
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:22,730
the combination of sanitary to

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,610
industrial facilities,

113
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,146
how many people live, wherever it is they live,

114
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:32,574
what the topology of the ground or the surface is,

115
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:36,720
so that we are able to understand how the sewage network is built.

116
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,846
Once we understand where it is we're located, Kando, we start

117
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:44,178
collecting information. I'll go into the deployment process also in

118
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:48,290
a few steps, a little bit further.

119
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,386
Then we start gathering our own information,

120
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:56,242
right? We have a bunch of sensors, some of them customary,

121
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:59,586
off the shelf. Others are designed

122
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:03,346
and built specifically to our specifications. Those sensors

123
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:07,422
generate a lot of signals. These signals need to be processed

124
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:11,926
and understood over time. And then lastly,

125
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,722
the very nontrivial bit of information that is partially our

126
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:19,658
proprietary and partially open source is data

127
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:23,386
about lab samples. Right? So we've

128
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:27,034
built our own database, as well as access externally

129
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:31,150
available data sources that tell us that when

130
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,754
a sampling process, which basically constitutes taking a little bit

131
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,386
of wastewater and sending it to an analysis in a lab, you can

132
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:41,940
see a sample of such analysis on the right here.

133
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,694
We are able to collect a lot of information about what

134
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:51,366
pollutants are found, where and when.

135
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:55,302
Okay, so these are kind of the main data sources that

136
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:58,838
we're working with day to day. Okay, great.

137
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:02,986
So now we understand what data goes into

138
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:06,922
our bellies, but what do we do with that information? So the first question

139
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:10,426
we need to answer is how our system needs to be deployed.

140
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,062
Right? So we need to understand, going into a new region, a new area,

141
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:16,970
a new wastewater treatment facility,

142
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,270
which locations need to be monitored, and how.

143
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,754
Right. The second question we need to understand

144
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:28,466
is what constitutes an event, right? So we have

145
00:09:28,488 --> 00:09:32,338
a lot of signals. What of these signals are interesting

146
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:36,322
and to which extent? Next,

147
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:39,606
once we found something that is interesting, we need to be able

148
00:09:39,628 --> 00:09:43,634
to understand what that is, whether or not it's something that requires direct action,

149
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:46,920
or is something that we just need to pass on as information.

150
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,410
And lastly, as I mentioned, having found something,

151
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,554
Kando understood what that something is, we would very

152
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:58,474
much like to be able to pinpoint specifically what that information source is.

153
00:09:58,512 --> 00:10:02,990
Right. Where this pollution is coming from Kando, understand who its

154
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,346
creator is. Okay, so let's

155
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:10,286
dive in into a little bit of the nuts and bolts. One question

156
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:14,418
is the deployment information, right. And for that,

157
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:18,610
we need to combine information about the

158
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,306
wastewater network, which is something that we typically get from our

159
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:25,714
customers, and a lot of open

160
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:29,078
source data. Right. Who are the people? Where do they live?

161
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:32,626
What information do we have about industrial

162
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:36,374
facilities to what sensors they belong, what these sectors do, how they

163
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,734
do it. Once we understand all that, we're able to generate

164
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:43,434
a map that says, well, this location is

165
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:47,260
very important. This location is not as important here. We need to have

166
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,642
finer resolution. And over there, we can just kind of get a typical

167
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:55,534
overall glance, and that will be enough for us. So we understand

168
00:10:55,652 --> 00:11:00,014
what facilities are located, where what

169
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:03,698
their potential pollution may be,

170
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:07,266
and where those potential pollutants are

171
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:11,010
gathered, such that we can focus on relevant areas.

172
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,410
Once we figure out where we need to be and we trade it off,

173
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,434
the resolution versus the cost of deployment,

174
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:22,550
et cetera, we actually start monitoring. Right. And monitoring basically

175
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,182
means generating a lot of time series through different

176
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:29,800
sensors. And as you can see, a tiny example over here,

177
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,562
it's not that easy to know when something is taking

178
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:36,986
place that is out of the ordinary versus kind of just the

179
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:40,860
regular bits and pieces of what happens throughout the day.

180
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,022
So in order to facilitate this

181
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:48,206
understanding of what an event is, we basically

182
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:52,986
have a three step process. One step generates candidates

183
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:56,910
using metrics for outlier detection that kind of identify

184
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:00,606
interesting bits of our signals. And we put those interesting bits

185
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:04,862
of our signals to the side, then the top candidates using,

186
00:12:04,936 --> 00:12:07,800
again, some scoring process that we have.

187
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,022
These signals are sent internally to

188
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:15,958
expert labelers who tell us what the relevant signals are.

189
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:19,558
In cases that they know. They don't always know, but a

190
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:22,506
lot of times they do. So they're able to tell us, well, this is one

191
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,898
type of an event, this is something or other. This is a

192
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:29,290
pollution of this type and so on. Kando, so forth.

193
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,422
Taking all this information, we are now able

194
00:12:33,476 --> 00:12:36,862
to proceed to the third step in which

195
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:40,526
we enrich our data set by matching the

196
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:44,174
known patterns to a lot of unknown data, where we can

197
00:12:44,212 --> 00:12:47,618
tell externally what needs to be relatively similar.

198
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:50,786
And once we know where to look, we know exactly what to look for.

199
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:54,466
We're able to get a lot more information relating to

200
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:58,386
a specific label. Of course, again with internal kind of validation.

201
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,190
Kando corrections.

202
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,086
All right, so we know where to look. We know kind

203
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:10,010
of what we're looking for. Now that we found samples of

204
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,134
interesting data, we need to be able to classify them. In order to classify

205
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:17,482
our samples, we typically, pardon me, go to two different

206
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:21,274
directions. One direction in completely classical

207
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:24,814
machine learning, is regression. And in regression, what we do

208
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:28,874
is we train an easily obtainable

209
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:32,754
source of information to match a very difficult to

210
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:36,674
obtain source of information, such that in

211
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:40,834
having trained a specific subset of locations and

212
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:44,718
events to that system,

213
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:48,514
we can now deploy the relatively easily

214
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:52,870
obtainable sensors that generate a lot of data instead

215
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,374
of the very difficult and cumbersome sensors that are very

216
00:13:56,412 --> 00:14:00,122
accurate but very hard to maintain. And this allows us

217
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:03,542
to be able to analyze signals that otherwise

218
00:14:03,606 --> 00:14:08,090
would be either very expensive or in

219
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,830
yet other cases, almost impossible to obtain.

220
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,526
That's the regression direction. And then the classification is,

221
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:17,694
as I mentioned previously, when we have

222
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:22,330
built a large enough data set of labeled or semilabeled information,

223
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,882
we're now able to, in real time, classify events to

224
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:30,370
belong to different sources of

225
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,610
pollution. Sorry, different types of pollution.

226
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,140
Okay, great.

227
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,754
The next point I'd like to get to, of course, is localization.

228
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,854
So we know where we're looking at. But at those

229
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:50,314
locations, we typically have distribution of our

230
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:53,834
sensors such that we have very

231
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:57,334
broad coverage closer to the wastewater treatment facility.

232
00:14:57,462 --> 00:15:01,242
And as we go closer to the industrial facilities

233
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:04,350
themselves, the coverage is obviously lower.

234
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,266
And we may be focused on specific regions or in specific producers,

235
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:12,030
but typically, we won't have coverage

236
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,594
that would be enough to identify every source on

237
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:21,026
its own. So typically, or a lot of the times, the information of

238
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:24,802
an event taking place comes from somewhere downstream, and then

239
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:28,210
we need to start building our

240
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,494
ladder in order to climb further and further upstream in

241
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:35,286
order to do that. So once we identify an event and we're able to

242
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:37,640
classify it to belong to a specific type,

243
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,586
we, from our open source data, can relate which are

244
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,594
the most probable pollutants to generate this information.

245
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:49,034
And having that information, we can now use our

246
00:15:49,152 --> 00:15:53,226
signals in order to climb upstream, match patterns

247
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:57,390
through various metrics. Kando, get to the point where we're able

248
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,162
to point the specific or most likely source

249
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,970
of our pollution to our user.

250
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,106
Okay, so we've gone through the

251
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:15,874
entire process of what

252
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:19,222
it is we need to see, where we need to see it when we find

253
00:16:19,276 --> 00:16:22,118
something, what it is we find, and finally,

254
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:25,720
where the information is coming from. This is basically

255
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,454
the entire pipe that we have, at least from data science

256
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:33,210
and machine learning perspective.

257
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,466
I didn't go a lot into the kind of the code behind it because

258
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:41,054
some of the information is, or some of the algorithms we use

259
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:44,990
are typical scikitlearn network x, et cetera

260
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,874
algorithms, and others are proprietary

261
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:52,314
that we kind of built either based on various

262
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:56,130
time series tools or something that we built completely from scratch.

263
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,114
But this is more or less the end to end of this

264
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,590
process and in the end of it, the main takeaway

265
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,006
here that I would like for you to go away with, or at least to

266
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:12,486
continue to the next session with, is that the

267
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:16,706
essence of what we do is to combine relatively

268
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:20,310
easily obtainable data, whether through proprietary

269
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,974
or available sensors, with intelligent

270
00:17:24,022 --> 00:17:27,994
processing techniques that allow us to focus on where to look, what to

271
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:31,086
look for, and to identify what it is we see,

272
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:35,002
in order to be able to give clear and understandable

273
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:38,814
information to our users that are then able to

274
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,686
drive change with the industries around them.

275
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:46,574
And basically the bottom line is that based on this, we're able

276
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:49,774
to give everyone where we're deployed, of course,

277
00:17:49,892 --> 00:17:53,806
cleaner, better water quality, which is one of

278
00:17:53,828 --> 00:17:57,494
the reasons that going to work

279
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:00,614
at can do, is a lot of fun. Thank you very

280
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:04,694
much. It was a pleasure for me to speak with you and please

281
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:08,630
feel free to reach out and I'll be happy to try. Kando, answer whatever

282
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,100
questions you might have. Thank you.
