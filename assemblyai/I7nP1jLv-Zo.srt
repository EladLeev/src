application is essential.

64
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,238
Sectors must develop a foundational

65
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:38,978
understanding of quantum computing concepts

66
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:43,270
and their potential applications. This knowledge

67
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,966
enables sectors to make informed

68
00:04:48,018 --> 00:04:51,782
decisions and identify areas where quantum

69
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:55,820
solution can have the greatest impact in their

70
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,506
industry. So what are the benefits of

71
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:04,394
quantum computing readiness? Quantum computing

72
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:08,058
readiness offer numerous advantages

73
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:11,354
that can greatly benefit

74
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,760
sectors in various ways.

75
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,086
First, enhance competitiveness by enabling

76
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:21,410
informed decisions,

77
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,786
cost reductions and the exploration

78
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:33,506
of innovation applications. This empower

79
00:05:33,618 --> 00:05:37,618
sectors to gain a

80
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:41,100
competitive edge in the market.

81
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,214
Second, quantum readiness ensure improved

82
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:51,678
sectors through these implementations of

83
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:56,558
robust framework, risks assessments and

84
00:05:56,724 --> 00:06:00,154
governance solutions. These measures

85
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:04,510
protect data from potential

86
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,302
risk posed by quantum computing

87
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:13,060
and ensure complaints with security

88
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,298
regulations. Last reason

89
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:21,238
quantum readiness facilities structures data

90
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:25,282
by computing it for quantum

91
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:29,222
algorithms. This enable accelerate

92
00:06:29,366 --> 00:06:32,730
processing, empowering hidden

93
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,450
insights and enhance efficiency

94
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,800
in handling big data.

95
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,342
It open up new

96
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:52,390
possibilities for sectors to drive meaningful

97
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,060
value for their data.

98
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,438
Now that we understand these benefit, let's explore

99
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:03,170
how sectors can achieve quantum readiness.

100
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,750
The first method is to establish

101
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,206
dedicated quantum computing office within

102
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,142
the sectors. This in house team will

103
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:20,998
be responsible for developing tailored

104
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:25,290
strategies, ensuring confidentially

105
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,546
and fostering

106
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:34,686
collaboration within the sectors. So it's the

107
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,558
team inside these

108
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:42,410
sectors. The other method is sectors can

109
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,274
partner with establishing quantum computing or

110
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:50,766
existing quantum computing companies through contractual

111
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:54,450
agreements. These allows them

112
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,970
to access improved technologies

113
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,706
and proven solutions that existing,

114
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:06,854
accelerating their progress and

115
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:11,310
assess their specific requirements.

116
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,194
The last available method is engaging with

117
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:19,610
quantum computing organizations, both national and international,

118
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,526
so the engagement is crucial. These organizations offer

119
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:29,322
valuable services and insights.

120
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:32,998
Examples for that the National Quantum

121
00:08:33,194 --> 00:08:36,690
Coordination Office, the MQCO

122
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,742
in the United States. The other example is the European

123
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:45,954
Quantum flagship and there are several

124
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:50,306
organizations in many countries focused

125
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:54,114
on the advanced quantum technologies

126
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,390
worldwide. These organizations provide guidance

127
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,090
and support sectors to prepare for

128
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,530
quantum risks and opportunities.

129
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,590
Collaborating with them ensure these sectors

130
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,930
stay up to date with the latest advancement

131
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,802
in the field. To further

132
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:21,438
accelerate quantum computing readiness, I would like to

133
00:09:21,524 --> 00:09:26,850
propose two recommendations that's not available today

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,462
for sectors to achieve readiness,

135
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:33,794
but is available to do for

136
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:37,350
sectors and governments.

137
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,446
And it's still a recommendation. First,

138
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:45,746
the establishment of governmental standardization

139
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,502
for quantum computing fields.

140
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:53,034
This will create a

141
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:56,422
good ecosystem by provide

142
00:09:56,486 --> 00:10:00,590
guidance, mitigate risks,

143
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,950
fostering collaboration and facilitate knowledge

144
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,398
exchange. We don't want two

145
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,750
companies work to solve the same solution.

146
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:20,642
So the governmental standards will let

147
00:10:20,696 --> 00:10:24,260
the organizations or the sectors or the companies

148
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,318
exchange their knowledge to solve different

149
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:33,142
problems. It ensure that everyone

150
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:37,990
is working towards the same goals and maximize

151
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,474
gains. The second one I

152
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:46,780
recommend the creation of an

153
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,420
international organization called,

154
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,786
I name it the Quantum Computing Standards organizations

155
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:58,506
QCS similar to ISO BCARB

156
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:02,270
SDG from the United nations.

157
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,382
The QCs would publish standards,

158
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:10,418
then provide guidance and then

159
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:16,070
offer certificate to sectors who meet

160
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,874
the requirement of these standards. By aligning

161
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:23,682
with the responsible research and innovation

162
00:11:23,746 --> 00:11:27,218
the RRI principles,

163
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:29,290
it can address challenges,

164
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,542
anticipate potential conference

165
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:40,102
and encourage sectors to develop quantum services.

166
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:45,610
This will build trust, stimulate computations

167
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:49,674
and drive the overall development

168
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:53,330
of quantum computing. Despite the challenges

169
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,502
improved despite the challenges

170
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:01,010
involved, establishing the

171
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,070
QCs is significant step

172
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,978
toward effective and safe implementation

173
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:14,390
of quantum computing across sectors and countries.

174
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,518
We have reached the final slide of our presentation,

175
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:22,106
let's recap the key point we have

176
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,638
discussed today. We discussed the importance of quantum

177
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:29,980
computing readiness for sectors. It gave them

178
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,026
competitive edge and open new opportunities.

179
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:37,642
Quantum computing readiness brings several

180
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:42,298
benefits. It increased competitiveness by enabling

181
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,590
informed decision, cost reduction and innovative

182
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,502
applications. It improves security through

183
00:12:51,636 --> 00:12:54,978
robust frameworks and risk assessment.

184
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:58,646
It also helps structure data

185
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:02,774
for efficient processing and handling big

186
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:05,906
data. To achieve quantum computing

187
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,318
readiness, sectors should establish

188
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,414
quantum computing office, contract with quantum

189
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:17,286
computing companies or engage with quantum

190
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:21,338
computing organization in their countries. Our recommendation

191
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:25,582
