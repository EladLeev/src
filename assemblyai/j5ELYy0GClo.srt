1
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,530
Engineer oncall is a common practice.

2
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,514
Each company takes it to a different direction, but the idea is

3
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:20,874
similar across all time and space. We want

4
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:24,186
to empower engineers to become fearless guardians of

5
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,930
their domain, and with great power comes

6
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,242
great responsibility. And we do want

7
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,330
them to be accountable and take full responsibility.

8
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,326
The oncall period might be daunting for many, but today we'll

9
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:42,910
unravel how a blend of strategies, onco practices,

10
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,414

32
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,070
into the lives of onco engineers.

33
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,418
Lastly, we'll delve into leadership's role

34
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:19,422
and the nurturing of an effective culture,

35
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:23,598
uncovering how these elements fortify

36
00:04:23,694 --> 00:04:27,460
an efficient oncall environments. Let's go.

37
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,182
In the challenging journey of oncall duty,

38
00:04:31,326 --> 00:04:34,566
sidekicks are indispensable in

39
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:37,590
navigating through the technological chaos.

40
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,734
Key players like incident management systems,

42
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:49,034
insightful dashboards and APM tools such as

43
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:51,770
Datadog and Neuralik,

44
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,966
become our vigilant allies, creating us

45
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:58,590
at the slightest murmur of trouble.

46
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,106
But throughout the battles, our most valuable sidekicks

47
00:05:04,218 --> 00:05:08,286
are our teammates, always standing besides

48
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:11,694
us, ensuring that no challenge is faced

49
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:15,358
alone. The cornerstones of oncology routine,

50
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,620
usually tailored by team,

51
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,274
whether on a sprint, weekly, or other basis,

52
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,862
with orchestrations often led by a team leader or

53
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,590
designated individual. Tools range from

54
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,022
simple documents to sophisticated systems like services,

55
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:36,860
pager duty, zen duty, or others,

56
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,390
ensuring smooth sailing and enabling meticulous tracking,

57
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,994
all aimed at fostering more serene on

58
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:49,534
call shifts. The oncall motor is clear

59
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:52,990
guard the system's health. Being oncall means

60
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,938
standing vigilant ready to respond to the summons.

61
00:05:57,114 --> 00:06:00,366
Whether from a teammate or an automated alert,

62
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,714
you should respond and acknowledge. I want

63
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:07,266
to state the office. If it's a person calling you in the middle of

64
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:10,902
the night, be nice. Trust that he's not doing

65
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:14,578
that for fun. Embarking on the pivotal

66
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,794
oncall odyssey, our hero seamlessly

67
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:21,354
transitions between proactive vigilance and

68
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:25,334
reactive action. The cycle commences with deliberate production,

69
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:28,954
where our engineer monitors dashboard and alerts while

70
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:33,282
examining recent deployment to detect potential incidents.

71
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:37,210
When an issue does emerge, she springs into action,

72
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,522
responding promptly. During the resolution phase,

73
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:44,302
our oncall hero navigates through triage, mitigation and

74
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:47,646
resolution, enlisting the aid of necessary teams

75
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:50,210
to reestablish system stability.

76
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,414
Even when the immediate crisis is mitigated,

77
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:58,442
she rallies the troops to permanently resolve lingering

78
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:01,538
issues in the aftermath.

79
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:05,250
Reflection and learning are crucial. Our hero

80
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,026
spearheads discussions and learning moments that shape

81
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,774
enhance future incident management and proactive

82
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:16,426
prevention. This helps make the system

83
00:07:16,528 --> 00:07:20,060
stronger and gets the team ready for future problems.

84
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,790
Heroes respond to the oncall, but on call superheroes

85
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,854
go a step further. They are proactive, scouting for

86
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:33,834
potential pitfalls and resolving them before they escalate.

87
00:07:33,962 --> 00:07:37,566
Regular check ins on system health and keen eye

88
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,074
on recent updates can prevent troubles when

89
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,654
an alert beacon's quick action keeps minor

90
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:48,900
glitches from becoming major crisis in unpleasant times.

91
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,866
Whether you catch a whisper of trouble, which is ideal,

92
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:55,746
or see a bad signal blazing in the sky,

93
00:07:55,858 --> 00:08:00,034
what's next on the agenda? It's all about triage,

94
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:03,562
mitigation and holding the investigation of root cause for

95
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,430
later on. Call isn't a lone vigilance

96
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,934
game. It's about highlighting issues and ensuring

97
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:14,782
they are managed promptly. Help is around the corner remember

98
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,400
our hero. Aim to restore peace, but first

99
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,602
they need to show up triage tactics.

100
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:26,538
Sometimes the issue might be outside your power to fix.

101
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:30,450
Your mission is to gather the basic facts. If the problem

102
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,386
is in your wheelhouse, jump into action, triaging and

103
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:38,066
either mitigate or resolving it. Work on the

104
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:41,334
problem till a solution is in

105
00:08:41,372 --> 00:08:45,746
sight or until you've handed it over to the right specialist.

106
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:50,150
In this case, make sure to perform a warm handover.

107
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,474
Remember, you own the scene, stay on scene and lend your

108
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:57,770
expertise until the incident concludes.

109
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,754
The primary goal when facing an incident is

110
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,594
service restoration. Gather the required intel,

111
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:09,086
form a strategy to mitigate or resolve the issue,

112
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:11,358
and rally everyone who can help.

113
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:15,134
Prioritize minimizing the impact on

114
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:19,374
customers before diving into investigation mode. If mitigation

115
00:09:19,502 --> 00:09:22,478
isn't in the cards, aim for resolution.

116
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:26,130
Time is of the essence after

117
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,086
the temps of an incident comes. Whether through a

118
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:32,966
walkaround, a rollback, or direct fix.

119
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:37,266
Our journey continues into a meticulous exploration

120
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:41,734
of its depth. It's time to dissect the event and

121
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:45,062
discover its root cause. This is

122
00:09:45,196 --> 00:09:48,774
also not a lone venture. It calls the assembly

123
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,910
of your allies together in unity.

124
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,954
Delve into the enigma, investigate,

125
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:57,950
and piece together the story behind the chaos.

126
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,026
Post incidental reflection is crucial.

127
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:05,694
After the dust had settled, it's important to

128
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:09,682
learn from what happened. Conducting a lesson learned also

129
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:13,810
known as postmortem or take in detail

130
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,566
an incident review that sketches a timeline of events.

131
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:21,906
Analyzes the root cause, employing strategies like the five whys

132
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:25,474
outlines action items with designated owners

133
00:10:25,522 --> 00:10:28,742
and etas. Draw up tasks for

134
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:32,646
future handling to ensure every lesson morphs

135
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:35,210
into a production measure.

136
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,482
Post incident arm yourself better with

137
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:43,286
prevention protocols craft runbooks

138
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:46,522
documentation based on the newfound knowledge,

139
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:49,680
leading to quicker triage in the future.

140
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,214
Where possible, develop tests and

141
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,946
automations replacing the incident, replicating the

142
00:10:56,968 --> 00:11:00,206
incident scenario, and refine metrics

143
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:03,854
and alerts for visibility. Every incident thus

144
00:11:03,902 --> 00:11:07,330
morphs into a shield against future troubles.

145
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,234
The roles of leadership in this realm are diverse.

146
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:15,058
Initially, they must ensure the engineering manager schedule

147
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:18,930
the oncall rotations. Following that, it's imperative

148
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,442
to provide guidelines and establish clear expectations around

149
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:26,406
the process. Occasionally, evaluating and adjusting

150
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:30,534
the process is necessary to ensure it meets its objectives

151
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:34,426
and aligns with the company's context. Moreover,

152
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:38,270
determine the severity and slas of incidents

153
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,554
is crucial task. They also formulate an escalation

154
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:46,750
policy that aligns with the severity of incidents.

155
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,362
As an engineering leader, stepping into the role of a

156
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:55,682
superhero, your main mission is to protect your team

157
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:59,798
from oncall burnout. Make sure to shield them

158
00:11:59,884 --> 00:12:03,238
from too much work and to always

159
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:06,914
respect their time. Keep late night shift strictly

160
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:11,094
for real emergencies, knowing that many issues can afford to

161
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:15,350
wait. Balance is essential. Put your team's

162
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,780
well being above constant hard work.

163
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:22,682
Some of my proudest leadership moment come

164
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:27,098
from identifying a situation as noncritical

165
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:30,494
and telling my heroes to stand down when

166
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:34,586
done right. This is not only avoid burnout,

167
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:39,150
but also builds trust and results in a team that's more engaged

168
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,970
knowing you'll only call them when it's truly necessary.

169
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,538
The key to unlocking the full potential of our heroes

170
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:52,262
lies in cultivating a positive and supportive oncall

171
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:56,150
culture. There are several do's and don'ts, but we'll focus

172
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,360
on the crucial ones.

173
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,662
Avoid a blame game. It's not about pointing fingers

174
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:06,646
at other teams or passing incidents around like a hot potato

175
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:09,882
in the heat of the moment. It doesn't matter

176
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:14,330
who started it. A blame culture can determine the individuals

177
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,110
from taking risks or owning up to mistakes.

178
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,606
Stay proactive. Don't just wait for solutions to

179
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:26,274
come to you. Engage actively. Exhibit a sense of
