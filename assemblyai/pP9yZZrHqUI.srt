1
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,826
I'd like to start out my talk by dropping a little bit of a truth

2
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:45,554
bomb on you, and that's that. If there's one thing I've

3
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:49,560
learned in my career in tech, it's that we get to choose

4
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,110
a lot. Now, we may not like

5
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,706
what we're choosing things horror

6
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:01,342
shows from my past that I've had to choose between, and we may not like

7
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:05,040
why we have to choose any of these things at all.

8
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,434
And we definitely don't like how often we get to choose.

9
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:12,242
Don't bother reading the details of this slide. It's an eye exam that basically is

10
00:01:12,296 --> 00:01:15,794
saying, shit changes all the time. In fact,

11
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:18,706
one of the things that I laughed about the most at the start of the

12
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:22,070
pandemic was all the media outlets saying, oh, it's the new

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,302
normal. And I'm thinking, oh, you mean when everything we know

14
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:28,438
gets thrown out the window and we have to find a completely different

15
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:31,962
way to do every aspect of our jobs? Yeah,

16
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:35,146
in tech, we have a word for that. It's called, oh, my gosh, look,

17
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:38,666
it's Tuesday. The sheer volume of

18
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:41,942
opportunities to choose creates a number of challenges,

19
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:45,514
but maybe none as much as the paralyzing fear

20
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:48,846
that we might choose wrong, which is the

21
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:52,850
point of my talk today. Thank you for joining me. As I look back across

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,530
a lifetime of poor technical choices

23
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,466
or another title for this is when you stare into the face of

24
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:03,860
failure and success, smiles back.

25
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,966
I don't know. It just happens. Thank you for joining

26
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:11,762
me. My name is Leonidato. I'm a middle aged white dude giving a conference

27
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:15,126
talk. I selected this picture to give you confidence that I know what

28
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:18,834
the hell I'm talking about. Nothing else on that slide really matters,

29
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:22,682
except that you can find me, as at Liana Dotto, on almost all

30
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:26,026
social media. More importantly, I want

31
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:29,594
you to understand that this is what I call an oyster talk. Now, I got

32
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:33,094
that idea from the parenting educator, Barbara Colaroso.

33
00:02:33,222 --> 00:02:36,734
And the point is that I have about half an hour to

34
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:40,238
talk to you here, and I cannot teach you anything in that amount of

35
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,066
time. In fact, in that amount of time, about the only thing I can do

36
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:46,286
is irritate you. Now, when an oyster becomes

37
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,450
irritated, it does one of two things. It either creates a pearl

38
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,462
or it dies. Now, it is my sincere

39
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:58,034
hope that I do not irritate you to death today. However, I did think

40
00:02:58,072 --> 00:03:01,154
it was fair to let you know that those are some risks.

41
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:05,110
Instead, what I hope is I give you just the grain of an idea

42
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,074
that you will then think about and layer over with your own experiences

43
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,918
until what you have is something that is polished and unique

44
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:16,074
and valuable to you. Now,

45
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,546
after 35 years in tech, I've learned something, and I want to share it with

46
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:23,390
you all right up front. And that's that. There is no such

47
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,306
thing as a poor technical choice. I know because I've

48
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:30,670
made some doozies. And today I'm just going to share a few

49
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,290
of the residents living in my technical house of horrors.

50
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:39,106
Okay, I take that back. There are some common decisions which

51
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:43,362
are clearly bad. For example, not having backups, that's bad.

52
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:46,626
Or thinking that replicas or mirrors or raid are backups,

53
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:50,226
that's also a bad technical choice. Moving fast and breaking

54
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:53,954
things in test, sure. In prod,

55
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:57,494
not so good. You do have

56
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:00,598
a test environment, right? Like we all should have a

57
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:03,514
test environment. We should all have an environment that we test things in that is

58
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:07,414
not actually production. Okay, you get my point. Bad technical

59
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:11,354
choice. Trying to do everything all by yourself. Bad technical

60
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:15,514
choice. Not a personal choice. A bad technical choice. Using oracle

61
00:04:15,562 --> 00:04:19,214
for literally anything at any time can be considered a

62
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:22,890
bad technical choice. Starting a land war in Asia.

63
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,986
Okay, fine, that was a princess bride quote, but I still had to include it

64
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:30,226
there. All right, so let's start. In 1984,

65
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:33,986
case Western Reserve University, IBM, and at and T wanted to build the

66
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:37,954
world's first free online community. Now, just for context,

67
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:41,574
case Western is a university not known for its technical program.

68
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:44,866
IBM is the stodgiest computer company in existence.

69
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:48,634
And at T is the zombified remains of a phone provider that

70
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:52,154
got more or less legislated out of existence. What could possibly go

71
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:55,846
wrong with this plan? And unbelievably, they succeeded.

72
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,418
They created a free public community computer system

73
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:03,046
which bore a strong resemblance to the BBS software I downloaded

74
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:06,254
onto my dad's compuware pc and ran when he

75
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:09,898
wasn't home, until he got the bill after the first month, the telephone

76
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:13,614
bill after the first month, and shut that all down. Now, I spent a

77
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:17,042
lot of time on freenet for a few reasons. First of all,

78
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:20,766
it was free. Second of all, you could reliably download uu

79
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:24,146
encoded ASCII porn on it. And third, there was a one

80
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:27,810
limit, time limit on that BBS system unless you became

81
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,558
a moderator in one of the SiGs or special interest

82
00:05:31,644 --> 00:05:35,234
groups. So I became an admin on the dungeons and Dragons Sig

83
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:38,966
because, of course I did. And I also became an admin on

84
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:42,122
the word processing Sig and a few others along the way.

85
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,186
Now, you'd have to be a child of the understand exactly how

86
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,946
much time you could sync into a dial up service. But you would

87
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,834
argue it's a complete waste of time, right? So freenet

88
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:57,374
was basically a glorified message board. And what you did on it was

89
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:00,766
that you posted messages on different areas and you

90
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,966
sent comes to the maybe 20 other people in the world who had

91
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,122
an email address in 1986. And to do that, you needed

92
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:10,590
to select an editor to actually write that stuff. Now, you had a choice.

93
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,322
You could use a homegrown abomination called Fred or

94
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,546
Emacs or Vi entirely at random.

95
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,298
I chose Vi as my default editor. I was 16

96
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,646
and I didn't know any better. And I learned Vi like it was

97
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:28,182
the most natural thing in the world. So,

98
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:32,106
fast forward to one of my first jobs. I was working desktop support in

99
00:06:32,128 --> 00:06:35,434
an engineering company, and the Unix admin came down. He was looking

100
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:39,002
for one of us to train into supporting one of the new

101
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:42,570
systems. And so he sat us down. He was one of those typical,

102
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,454
you know, grumpy big beard and everything. And he talked

103
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:50,318
to us and he said, okay, well, I'm going to have to pick one of

104
00:06:50,324 --> 00:06:53,198
you boneheads to do this. And even before I can teach you the system,

105
00:06:53,284 --> 00:06:56,786
I have to teach you this weird thing that nobody ever gets, and it

106
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:59,810
takes forever for you people to learn. It's called Vi.

107
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,010
You know that scene in Jurassic park?

108
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,278
Yeah. The point is that without those hours I spent on

109
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:10,246
freenet, I wouldn't have gotten the chance to move up.

110
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:14,274
By the way, the system that I learned was bind version

111
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:17,746
eight, the first production version of what would eventually

112
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:21,402
be called DNS. There was no part of this talk where I say that learning

113
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:25,180
DNS was or is a good choice, just to be clear.

114
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,146
So next story, I got my start in tech as

115
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:32,454
a classroom instructor teaching adults how to use things like Wordstar

116
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:36,366
Lotus one, two, three. Word perfect. And my boss thought it was important that

117
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:40,078
I have some certification since I was coming from outside

118
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:43,602
the tech sphere. And so I spent 80 hours taking my word

119
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:47,282
perfect certified resource test, not studying for the test.

120
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:50,420
It took me 80 hours to take the test.

121
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,242
Back in my day, we had to certify 10 miles uphill

122
00:07:55,326 --> 00:08:00,678
both ways in the snow, and we liked it anyway.

123
00:08:00,764 --> 00:08:04,902
Where's word perfect now? I mean, it's kind of

124
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,799
part of comes, but not really, but bought by Novell anyway, it was a

125
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:12,314
complete waste of time. Right? By the way, you can see the certification right there.

126
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:15,340
Yeah, complete waste of time, right?

127
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,626
Well, Wordperfect had gone the revolutionary route of

128
00:08:19,648 --> 00:08:23,086
hiding formatting codes before that, if you wanted to format something, you actually put

129
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:26,446
the formatting codes on the screen with everything else, but you would

130
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:30,238
see instead a representation of bold or underline or whatever.

131
00:08:30,404 --> 00:08:34,094
Now, sometimes you had to fix overlapping codes, and for

132
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:37,474
that there was a feature called reveal codes. It looked like that.

133
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:40,770
So you can see down below in the second bottom half of my screen here

134
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,466
where there's underline and where those bold starts and stops and

135
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:47,762
all that stuff. Which is why a few years later,

136
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:51,842
it took me about 15 minutes to wrap my head around how HTML

137
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,014
worked. And that helped me in a lot of ways that I'm going to talk

138
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:58,540
about in a little bit. But let me keep going.

139
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,554
So, like you, my browser has about

140
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:06,118
8000 open tabs. But before the Internet,

141
00:09:06,294 --> 00:09:10,154
the way that you would keep up to date on stuff is voraciously reading every

142
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:13,566
tech magazine. I would tear out articles that I wanted to keep.

143
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,906
I'd tape the pages into scrapbooks

144
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:20,942
and create my own IT technology murder board and everything.

145
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:24,702
And maybe worst of all, I really liked what I was learning

146
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:27,346
and so I wanted to share it with everybody I knew. And so I would

147
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:30,814
try to engage my coworkers in conversations. Did you see how Borland

148
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:34,258
is taking on the limb standard? I was really a

149
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:38,586
lot of fun at parties, let me tell you. I was so desperate

150
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:41,986
to share the information that the Unix

151
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:45,734
admin, the one who I knew Vi, and so he took a liking to me.

152
00:09:45,932 --> 00:09:49,686
Well, he knew I knew Vi and he knew I learned HTML pretty

153
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:53,354
quickly. So he set up a web server for me and so I could

154
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,954
type the snippets of the magazines into web pages and

155
00:09:56,992 --> 00:10:01,290
share them. Now, literally nobody ever read those pages,

156
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,046
but I learned how to create web pages really

157
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:08,366
quickly. And when I was out of work a few years later, I had

158
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:11,934
everything I need to start building websites for people on the side and

159
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:15,458
do it faster than most people could. Now, I'll explain more about that in a

160
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:19,426
minute also. But knowing HTML literally helped me put food on

161
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:21,940
the table. But there's more.

162
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,146
Typing HTML week after week got tedious, so I asked the

163
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:29,910
Unix admin how to automate it. He taught me literally enough

164
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,922
perl to be dangerous. I wrote ridiculously complicated

165
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:37,426
scripts that would take the raw text input out of a text file

166
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,938
and then smash it together into web pages and figure out where the line breaks

167
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:43,674
were and add the paragraph marks and everything and figure out what the next page

168
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:47,158
name was supposed to be and then update the index HTML file.

169
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:50,310
I was very, very proud of my achievement.

170
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,774
But like I said, nobody ever read those pages. So what

171
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:57,306
value did any of that have? So my leap

172
00:10:57,338 --> 00:11:00,826
into the world of monitoring started with a tool called Tivoli.

173
00:11:00,938 --> 00:11:04,802
Now later on, I would include tools, everything from

174
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:08,514
openview to Nagios, to SolarWinds, to new

175
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:12,238
relic to Shinkan to Zabix and Grafana.

176
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:16,214
But I have to admit, Tivoli was my first tool

177
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:20,514
for its time. Tivoli was a comprehensive multi million dollar

178
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:24,098
solution. It had modules for system inventory and software distribution

179
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:26,770
and metrics collection and event correlation.

180
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,698
Tivoli was also basically a gang of perl scripts and

181
00:11:30,704 --> 00:11:33,882
a trench coat and that lobbed monitoring data

182
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:37,722
into a Corba backend database. Nobody with an ounce of common

183
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:41,386
sense wanted anything to do with this freak show of a tool. But of course,

184
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:44,862
I heard the word perl and I was all in. And just like

185
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:48,910
when I was 16, learning Vi, I was too new to everything to understand

186
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,490
how truly awful it was. It all seemed perfectly normal.

187
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,658
But everything I learned set me up for the next 25 years

188
00:11:56,824 --> 00:12:00,114
of my career. Now, Tivoli was good

189
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,250
at a lot of things. Windows was not

190
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,686
one of them. So we had to find this weird third

191
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:10,262
party tool called SMS, which you see on the screen.

192
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:13,558
But it's not actually the Microsoft SMS it was. Before that,

193
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:16,226
it was just SMS systems,

194
00:12:16,418 --> 00:12:20,234
server monitoring system. And integrating the data

195
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:24,154
wasn't just hard tools at that time not

196
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:27,654
only didn't easily integrate

197
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:31,126
or combine themselves with other tools,

198
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:34,654
they actively resisted the

199
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:38,094
effort of integration. It took months to get this

200
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,566
all to fit together. And in all honesty, it was a bad tool and

201
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:45,362
we probably should have built it ourselves at the time. But we learned a

202
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:49,374
lot about integration and data types and transforms.

203
00:12:49,422 --> 00:12:53,410
And believe it or not, I use everything that I learned back at that time,

204
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,474
even today as I'm working with newer and more robust

205
00:12:57,522 --> 00:13:01,554
tools. And yes, that SMS was bought by Microsoft

206
00:13:01,602 --> 00:13:05,394
and turned to Microsoft SMS, which became SCCM,

207
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:09,402
which then became SCOM, which then became ECM, which then became whatever

208
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,874
the heck Microsoft is calling it this week. And again, knowing the

209
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:17,050
underlying foundations of how tools are built definitely helps.

210
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,414
Tivoli had a GUI for doing things like grouping

211
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:25,674
systems together for software distribution. And naturally you could create groups,

212
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,102
and you could create groups of groups, and then you could create a group

213
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:32,734
of groups of. Actually you couldn't do that because

214
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:36,106
every time I did that, the entire database would crash and corrupt

215
00:13:36,138 --> 00:13:39,378
and I would have to either rebuild it from scratch or restore it from a

216
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:43,330
backup. And I really wanted to know why. And so I did some digging.

217
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,266
Remember that Corba backend that I talked about. It was one

218
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:51,160
of the first object oriented databases in history,

219
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,558
but it could only handle three levels of containership, of object

220
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:59,318
containership. After that, it would just die. Now,

221
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:03,146
Corba wasn't my choice. It was Tivoli's choice when

222
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:06,678
they. But the tool. But over the three separate weekends

223
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:10,066
that I spent rebuilding the Tivoli database, I learned a lot about the impact

224
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:13,806
of downstream consequences and also the importance of

225
00:14:13,908 --> 00:14:17,386
understanding the architecture that was being implemented and knowing

226
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:21,866
the ramifications of that. Because sometimes a software tool's pedigree

227
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:25,918
really does matter. Okay. The work that

228
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,946
I did on Tivoli got me noticed at the company I was at, which was

229
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,146
Nestle, and they offered me the chance of a lifetime. They were

230
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:35,678
going to move me and my family to the world headquarters

231
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:39,554
and work on a really big project, global monitoring.

232
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:43,906
250,000 systems in 5000 locations.

233
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:47,510
So they packed up my family and we landed in Switzerland

234
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,442
on September 1, 2000, and 110

235
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:56,090
days before 911. It was also six months,

236
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,606
almost to the day before the.com bubble burst,

237
00:14:59,718 --> 00:15:03,214
at which point everyone in the project was sent home in the middle

238
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:06,414
of a recession. I was out of any

239
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:09,360
kind of steady work for 18 months.

240
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,726
I spent a lot of time feeling that that choice that I'd

241
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,442
made to accept the opportunity to move to a new country

242
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:21,314
and everything, I really spent time feeling that that choice had

243
00:15:21,352 --> 00:15:22,980
ruined everything.

244
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,766
And over the next few months, I learned a little

245
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:31,414
bit about humility. I learned a lot about myself

246
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:34,998
and mental health and my value as a person

247
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:39,018
and not just the source of a paycheck. I learned who my friends

248
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,326
were and who I could rely on. And I learned

249
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,150
that times can get very, very tight

250
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,006
and still contain moments of joy and

251
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:53,742
how important it was to recognize those moments and

252
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:57,214
relish them and just be in

253
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:00,720
those moments, regardless of what's happening around you.

254
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:04,190
Okay. The next story actually wasn't me,

255
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,586
but I observed it very close up and I wanted to share

256
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:11,198
it with you. It's kind of poor technical choice. Voyeurism or rubber

257
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:14,594
necking, as the slide says. All right. I saw two

258
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:17,826
different sev one events. Events that brought

259
00:16:17,858 --> 00:16:21,714
the entire system crashing down. Two events, one week apart.

260
00:16:21,842 --> 00:16:25,650
In both cases, it was because of a configuration

261
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,142
change that happened in production. One person

262
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,842
was immediately walked out the door. The other person was given a stern talking

263
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:36,426
to. So what was the difference? The first person made

264
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:39,926
the change, saw that everything had crashed, immediately flagged

265
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,218
it, let people know, owned up to it. They couldn't

266
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,782
fix it. They didn't have the permissions or the skill, but they

267
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:50,314
offered to be there through the entire process. They offered to bring coffee,

268
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:53,454
to bring pizza, to watch, to learn,

269
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:56,846
to make sure that they understood the impact of

270
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:59,586
what they had done so that they would never do it again and that they

271
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:03,202
could actually help when they saw other problems that were similar happen

272
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,514
like it. The second person saw what

273
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:10,230
happened and tried to bury it. There's always

274
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,686
a log file. It's always in the logs. Now,

275
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:17,906
those lesson here should be pretty obvious. Do not try to hide your mistakes.

276
00:17:18,018 --> 00:17:22,182
There isn't or shouldn't be the expectation of perfection,

277
00:17:22,326 --> 00:17:25,782
but there is, or at least there should be an expectation

278
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:29,946
of decency. A few years ago I was tweaking an alert and

279
00:17:29,968 --> 00:17:33,214
I accidentally caught 772

280
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:37,102
tickets twice in 15 minutes.

281
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:40,286
And the worst part was, I didn't even know that I had done it

282
00:17:40,308 --> 00:17:44,202
until the entire help desk came up to my cubicle and invited

283
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,762
me down to their area to help them manually close

284
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,234
the 1544 tickets one

285
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:54,754
by one. Yes, there was a mass close function. They wouldn't let

286
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:58,134
me use it. Now, with those benefit of time

287
00:17:58,252 --> 00:18:01,954
and experience, maybe some alcohol, I can reflect

288
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:05,526
on this formative event and wonder whose fault was it? Was it

289
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:09,350
the tool that allowed such a thing to happen? Or was it the operator?

290
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,858
There's probably enough blame to go around, but in a larger sense it

291
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:16,810
was an immature philosophy about what an alert actually is.

292
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,506
Now, all of that is the topic of a completely different talk. But for

293
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:24,320
today, the lesson is on the screen right there.

294
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,382
That screen was created by the vendor after the event

295
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:31,934
I just described, because I told them about it and said, why did you let

296
00:18:31,972 --> 00:18:35,646
this happen? I wasn't the first person to experience it,

297
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,438
but when I became a Devrel advocate for that vendor

298
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:43,202
a couple of years later, it was something that I could articulate very

299
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,674
passionately and convincingly and get them to make a

300
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:50,326
meaningful change until they resolved it and gave a

301
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:53,574
screen that said, oh my gosh, you're about to do something bad. Maybe think

302
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:57,722
about it. So that's the point, is that the experience

303
00:18:57,776 --> 00:19:01,066
I had fed into my ability to

304
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:04,630
make meaningful change. As I said at the beginning,

305
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,294
the sheer number of choices and possible negative

306
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:12,182
outcomes can be paralyzing. It is a Whitman sampler

307
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:15,614
of possible crap. In fact, you get this sort of choose

308
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:19,486
your own adventure kind of list of things. For example,

309
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:23,390
do you do kubernetes or do you choose not to do kubernetes? Do you

310
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,786
implement an integration to chat jeopardy. That is how you say it.

311
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:30,030
Or do you not do it? Do you use blockchain or not use blockchain

312
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,410
or this framework or that language or this platform?

313
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,854
Or do you put your system on AWS or Azure or

314
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:40,614
GCP or all three of them? Do you use oracle for

315
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:43,890
literally anything ever? No, you don't.

316
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,894
Do you use on prem versus colo versus cloud versus

317
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:51,994
a hybrid approach? Do you use monitoring with this solution or

318
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:55,270
that solution, or all the solutions combined,

319
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,906
or do you build it yourself? All of these choices

320
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:03,162
hold potential success or disaster,

321
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:07,626
and there's almost no way of knowing Seth

322
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:11,454
Godin, one of my personal heroes, addressed those inherent fear many

323
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:14,470
of us have. He called it technical fomo,

324
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,258
the fear of missing out, the fear of not getting into

325
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:21,694
or onto the next thing. And it causes us to hesitate

326
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:25,742
to get involved in something now. But what he said

327
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:29,510
is so very relevant. This thing, those thing we have

328
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,726
now, is worth working with because it offers so

329
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,854
many opportunities compared with merely waiting for the next thing.

330
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:40,394
It's always a good choice to work with

331
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:43,610
what you have now and not worry that you'll be

332
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,180
too engaged to pick up the next thing, which may be better,

333
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,294
but I know I said that my point was there were

334
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:54,894
no poor technical choices. But can

335
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:59,450
that be it? I mean, that seems really trite, really banal, really predictable.

336
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,378
Maybe the lesson is that the real treasure was the cables that

337
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:06,546
we collected along the way. Or maybe

338
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:10,450
it's something else. One last set of lessons.

339
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,042
I learned the word loquacious very early. Loquacious means

340
00:21:15,096 --> 00:21:18,726
tending to talk a great deal. I learned it in fourth grade when

341
00:21:18,748 --> 00:21:22,306
it appeared on my report card. Because my teacher

342
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:26,306
used it to describe me, I'd end up seeing that word a lot. Also overly

343
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,914
communicative and oversharing and diarrhea of

344
00:21:29,952 --> 00:21:34,202
the mouth. I also wrote a lot

345
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,980
all through school.

346
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,730
Now, my notes were comprehensive, but not exactly

347
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,634
on topic. If you wanted to know whose chair made that weird farting

348
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:48,302
noise at 1115 in social studies class, I was your guy.

349
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:51,998
My notes may not have had the facts or details, but the 1812 war,

350
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:54,690
but in their own way they were comprehensive.

351
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,374
Also, from the time I was ten years old until I graduated

352
00:21:59,422 --> 00:22:02,626
from college, 100% of my time was spent pursuing a

353
00:22:02,648 --> 00:22:06,566
career in theater. In fact, my senior year I

354
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:10,326
had two academic classes and seven classes that

355
00:22:10,348 --> 00:22:13,800
were choir, drama, band, and so on.

356
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,406
All that time spent, and I'm not doing any of that today.

357
00:22:18,508 --> 00:22:21,494
So you could argue that all three of these things that you see were poor

358
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:24,714
uses of my time. But on the other

359
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:28,054
hand, I'm a developer relations advocate

360
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:30,762
or evangelist or whatever you want to call it.

361
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:34,894
And how do you do that job? Well, you do a lot of talking to

362
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:38,334
customers. You participate by typing in

363
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:41,742
online forums. You create videos like this one you

364
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:45,726
present at conference talks, you are with people on podcasts

365
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:49,634
and so on, along with everything you see here. Remember that

366
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:53,234
my entry into technology was to provide training to learn

367
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:57,190
how to relate to a group and present detailed information in an interesting

368
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,886
and even entertaining way, and sometimes to take a

369
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:05,080
technical pie in the face just to keep everyone enjoying themselves.

370
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,310
All that writing early on served me pretty well in the blogging circuit

371
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:13,366
and theater definitely helps me be comfortable in situations

372
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:17,302
like this where I'm standing up in front of an audience of people and sharing

373
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:21,630
ideas with you. Today there really aren't any

374
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,266
poor technical choices, and that's because it's

375
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:29,966
not about the tech. In fact, it was never about the tech.

376
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:33,120
It will always be about you.

377
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,894
I've left this slide blank on purpose to

378
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:40,802
leave room for what you bring to the story. You're probably already thinking about

379
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:44,354
your experiences and how they relate to the ones I've been sharing. You, or are

380
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:47,138
similar or different in many different ways.

381
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:50,774
We pick up technical puzzle pieces throughout our

382
00:23:50,812 --> 00:23:54,086
journey in our career, and often it seems like the things that we pick

383
00:23:54,108 --> 00:23:57,654
up have nowhere to go, but the truth is that they will

384
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:01,466
all fit somewhere eventually. In fact,

385
00:24:01,488 --> 00:24:05,242
I felt so strongly that everyone's journey is valuable and worth

386
00:24:05,296 --> 00:24:08,986
talking about that I made this talk open source. If you go

387
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:13,040
onto my GitHub repo, which you'll see there, you can download it and

388
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,230
submit it as a CFP to your own conferences, share your own amazing

389
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,878
details, and run with it. There is never going to be

390
00:24:20,964 --> 00:24:23,380
a part of your skills, your experience,

391
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,746
your life that won't apply at comes point.

392
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:31,486
The trick the real lesson of this talk is that we have to commit

393
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:35,106
ourselves to showing up every day ready to

394
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:38,534
apply both who we are and what we know. And if

395
00:24:38,572 --> 00:24:41,862
we do that, there really will be no such

396
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,630
thing as a poor technical choice.

397
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,966
As I mentioned at the start of this talk, I can't teach you

398
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,450
much, but I might irritate you. So if you're feeling irritated,

399
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,226
it's time to start mulling over that grain of an idea and creating

400
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:59,186
a pearl of your very own. Meanwhile,

401
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:02,670
online line in the chat of those

402
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,840
conference I am ready for your questions.

403
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,340
Thank you very much.
