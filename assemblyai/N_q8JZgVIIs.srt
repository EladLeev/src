1
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,070
You. The imposter syndrome.

2
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,510
Do you happen to know what's the alternative name for imposter syndrome?

3
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,602
It's the you're not good enough syndrome.

4
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:41,186
You suck. You're a cheater. You're a fraud.

5
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:44,646
You're just a result of a lucky coincidence. Everything that

6
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:48,520
you achieved is due to sheer luck. And basically,

7
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,600
if anybody revealed you,

8
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,290
you would be considered a fraud and sent to an exile,

9
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,978
removed from the tribe.

10
00:00:58,154 --> 00:01:02,790
And basically, that creates feelings of anxiousness, of fear,

11
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,594
of self doubt. That's pretty much the

12
00:01:06,712 --> 00:01:09,140
imposter syndrome 101.

13
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,154
Now, the best way to

14
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:17,058
deal with anything, like to deal with any unknown enemy,

15
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:20,630
is to learn more about it. And that's pretty much

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,246
where I see my job today. My job is to tell

17
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:28,134
you a bit more about what imposters syndrome

18
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:31,546
is, how it affects us, and what are

19
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:34,966
some effective techniques for dealing with imposters syndrome

20
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:39,254
itself. Now, one bigger

21
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:42,890
issue than the syndrome itself is the fact

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,366
that so many of us are not even aware of it. So many

23
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:49,774
of us have no idea that it exists at all. And I

24
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:54,334
generally think that's stupid. And it's stupid because just

25
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:58,274
by learning more about it or just by educating yourself, you could get yourself way

26
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:01,522
more prepared. And once the enemy attacks, and trust

27
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:05,090
me, imposters syndrome is always there. It's always waiting

28
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,022
for an opportunity to attack. So once it does attack,

29
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:12,550
by being prepared, you can actually have your defense prepared up front.

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,246
And that's way better than being attacked by an unknown enemy and

31
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:20,106
going into a state of complete chaos and kind of running for

32
00:02:20,128 --> 00:02:23,686
your life, which is what you do when something unknown attacks

33
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:28,070
you. Now, why is it called fighting the syndrome?

34
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,534
Well, the thing is that from my

35
00:02:31,572 --> 00:02:36,430
findings and from spending a lot of time in therapy,

36
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,694
what I came to learn is that it

37
00:02:41,732 --> 00:02:45,682
seems that you're never able to actually overcome the imposters syndrome. Like, get completely

38
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:49,634
rid of it, like, to conquer it. And it's especially true

39
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:52,962
if you go and read about some successful people, and if you read

40
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:56,646
their autobiographies or biographies and assuming they

41
00:02:56,668 --> 00:03:00,166
are honest, what you usually learn is that so many

42
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:03,990
of them are dealing with the exact same issues of

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,782
fear, doubt, you're not good enough, whatever. But it's just,

44
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:11,894
like, tenfold. The more successful you are, the more of these feelings

45
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,930
you have. So you can't really conquer it,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,986
but you can learn some techniques and tactics for fighting it.

47
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:21,360
And that's exactly what I will be talking about.

48
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,278
Now, before we jump into what,

49
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:29,886
how, whatever, I'd like to share a very recent example that

50
00:03:29,908 --> 00:03:33,586
I shared on my Twitter. So I let

51
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:35,060
the image speak for itself.

52
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,994
It's quite an irony, I know, but just

53
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:47,070
by preparing this presentation, I has having one of the most massive,

54
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,230
ever biggest attacks of imposter syndrome.

55
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,386
Are you sure that you know about it? Are you sure that you can prepare

56
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:58,310
enough for it? Are you sure that you know what you're talking about?

57
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,926
What if everybody realizes that you actually have no idea? Maybe you haven't spent

58
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:05,574
enough time. Maybe you haven't learned enough. All those feelings

59
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:09,546
of self doubt and questioning yourself and

60
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:13,422
pretty much being insecure about yourself, they all rise to the top.

61
00:04:13,476 --> 00:04:17,082
And it literally happened just by preparing this presentation about fighting

62
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:20,880
the imposter syndrome. And another example thats,

63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,890
I can't say it's recent, but it's more of a recurring problem,

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,042
is maybe some of you know,

65
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:32,674
maybe some don't. But for a while, for two years now,

66
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:36,120
I've been running a personal blog where I write everything

67
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:41,286
from programming to mental health to some general

68
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:44,646
life thoughts. And what's funny about it

69
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:48,678
is that I would, like, spend hours or

70
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:52,642
days and sometimes even weeks writing and then editing

71
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:55,270
and rewriting and thinking about the article.

72
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,522
And the moment I publish

73
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:03,214
it, it. I would

74
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,474
feel a small amount of excitement the moment I publish

75
00:05:06,522 --> 00:05:10,590
it. But then, God forbid if it generated

76
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,842
some success or some positive feedback, whatever, I would get excited

77
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:18,260
initially. But then my first next thought would be,

78
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,650
what I'm going to do next. How am I going to repeat this success?

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,994
How am I going to do this again? I'll never be able to do this

80
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,466
again. This was just a lucky coincidence, and I'll

81
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:31,590
never be able to do this again. And what do I do now?

82
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,430
Maybe I should have waited.

83
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,698
All those stupid feelings of I'm not good enough.

84
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,010
Doubting myself, questioning myself.

85
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,260
So, as you can see, you never actually get rid of it.

86
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,600
And there is a but obviously, the good thing is that you

87
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,562
can learn to deal with it. And most importantly,

88
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:59,290
you can learn how to recognize the patterns,

89
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,634
because impulse syndrome comes in specific patterns.

90
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,906
And by recognizing those patterns, you can say, oh, okay, I see

91
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:09,922
what this is. I see what this is all about. And usually it

92
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:13,166
can be actually an indicator that you're on a good path,

93
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:16,334
because you get those feelings of questioning

94
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:20,286
yourself only when you are about to leave your comfort zone

95
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:23,574
or when you're leaving your comfort zone. But the moment you leave it, they actually

96
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:26,854
disappear. So it's actually just a signal that you are about to leave

97
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:30,140
your comfort zone, which is usually a good thing, because you do want

98
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,806
to leave that zone. Now, sometimes those feelings can be paralyzing.

99
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:37,994
I know, but you just have to practice and

100
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:41,066
push yourself pretty much, but we'll get to that eventually.

101
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:42,000
Now,

102
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,950
before going into the details, I'd also like to share a personal

103
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,682
story of mine. And the reason why I want to share

104
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:59,186
this story is because so

105
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,754
many of us, especially in software engineering, so many of us actually

106
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:06,120
go through some same issues, some same problems,

107
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,778
questions, fears, anxieties,

108
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:13,350
frustrations, whatever. And yet we never share them.

109
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,454
This is really funny. We never share these findings with others,

110
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:20,406
and by not sharing them, we feel kind of isolated.

111
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:23,994
We are the only ones going through this, and the feelings of

112
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:27,562
isolation leads to even more frustration or whatever.

113
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:31,130
So whatever the initial feeling was, it just gets emphasized

114
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,842
and the effects

115
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:38,414
increase just by the fact that you're feeling that you're the only one

116
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:43,966
going through this. So what

117
00:07:43,988 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm hoping to do is to show you that you're not the only one

118
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,814
and not that you're not the only one. But probably by

119
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:56,694
hearing this story, you might recognize some of the pet thats you are

120
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:59,238
having yourself as well.

121
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:04,278
Now, the story begins probably

122
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:07,320
around ten years ago or so. Now,

123
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,350
I was doing programming since I was six or whatever. So I just loved

124
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,754
it. I did it my whole life. And just by the sheer fact that

125
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:18,922
I was doing a lot of it, I sort of became good at it.

126
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:22,278
And eventually somebody wanted to pay me to do it, which was like

127
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:25,998
a win win. Somebody was paying me to do something thats I would be doing

128
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:28,560
in a free time anyway. Now,

129
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,226
when you're investing a lot of time and effort and

130
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:36,674
energy into something that you're pretty much passionate about, you usually get

131
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:39,842
results, and you usually get good results. Pretty much.

132
00:08:39,896 --> 00:08:43,890
So I was advancing my career pretty fast,

133
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,042
and by my early to mid 20s,

134
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:50,866
sort of, I was already a team lead. Well, a lead developer,

135
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,806
a team lead, whatever. And I'm not sure

136
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:58,902
you could probably call it either the best or worst thing that happened

137
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,394
to me. It's the best thing because obviously my

138
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:05,626
achievements were recognized. But it could be one of

139
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:11,514
the worst things because I had no idea what I was doing by

140
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,974
having this imposter syndrome, which I wasn't even aware of.

141
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:18,286
One of the huge issues with a lot

142
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,742
of things is not being able to name them, because once you can name something,

143
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:25,940
you can also solve it. But I have no idea what imposters syndrome was.

144
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,338
So I was feeling like I don't deserve this position.

145
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:33,954
I ended up in this position by a sheer luck, especially given

146
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:37,202
the fact that I was leading a team of people who were almost double age

147
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:40,566
of mine, well, not double, but at least ten years older than

148
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:44,534
me. So I was like, okay, I'm bossing people who are way

149
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:47,718
more experienced than myself. So I assumed it was a

150
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:50,710
lucky coincidence, and I had to prove myself.

151
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,486
Obviously, it wasn't enough that I ended up there. I actually felt

152
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:58,026
like, now I need to prove myself, which is stupid, because I already proved by

153
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:00,380
the fact that I ended up there. But anyway,

154
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,046
so I started putting crazy long hours into work you

155
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:09,662
wouldn't believe, to which point, crazy like I would work like ten or 12 hours

156
00:10:09,716 --> 00:10:13,318
a day. And what I also didn't

157
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:16,898
know at the time, which is something that you should probably learn,

158
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,466
is that maybe you

159
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:24,980
haven't heard of it, but there is this point of diminishing returns, because usually

160
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,480
you invest some time and work and you get results back.

161
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,534
It's linear, pretty much like, the more work

162
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:38,202
you put, the more results you get. But there comes this point

163
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:41,914
of diminishing returns where you actually

164
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:45,766
start putting more effort, but the results, like the productivity starts falling

165
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:49,658
down. And I had no idea about it because young

166
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:53,550
experiences, pretty energetic. So I had no idea about it.

167
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,230
So I noticed my productivity started to drop.

168
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,150
And obviously this inner voice,

169
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,274
the biggest characteristic of imposter syndrome, just increased

170
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:08,578
its volume, turned the knob to

171
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,514
the right completely, and it just made me feel more

172
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:16,274
insecure about myself. So I did the only thing that I could do,

173
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:19,494
that I only knew how to do, and that was putting more work.

174
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:23,222
So I started putting even more work into that. And by putting

175
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:26,070
more work, I actually got even worse results.

176
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,020
And this came to a point which

177
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,866
I remember quite clearly. And I

178
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:41,274
woke up one morning and I

179
00:11:41,312 --> 00:11:44,462
literally felt physically sick about the sheer thought of going to the office

180
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:48,382
for one more day. Just by thinking about going

181
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:51,920
to the office and spending one more day there

182
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,002
talking to my boss, I was having

183
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:59,234
this vomit reflex, this nausea, this pain,

184
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:02,050
like a physical pain, just by thinking about the office.

185
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,806
And what

186
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:10,358
I would learn later is thats what I would learn in

187
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:14,934
the therapy where I eventually ended up, is that there

188
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:18,230
exists a concept called mental depth,

189
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,690
which is kind of similar to tech depth,

190
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,734
but you just accumulate it by doing intellectual

191
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:28,778
work and for example, programming, obviously,

192
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:32,670
or writing or whatever. Whenever you involve your mind

193
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,510
into something like your intellect, you are collecting this

194
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,266
mental depth. And just like with the tech depth, if you're not maintaining

195
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:44,210
it properly, it threatens to danger

196
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,746
your mental base and eventually to make

197
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:51,540
it unusable. So some of the common manifestations that

198
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,526
some of you surely know about them are starting to

199
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,510
think that your boss is a dick.

200
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,342
Your organization is a perfect example of a lack of

201
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:05,926
organization. Management is only thinking.

202
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,494
Management is making stupid decisions, and if they only listen to you or to

203
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:13,386
developments, things would be different. Then you start thinking that grass is

204
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:17,210
probably greener on the other side, and things like that. Those are some common

205
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,850
manifestations of mental depth, which I had no idea about.

206
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,862
And as I said, if you keep accumulating

207
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:27,454
this depth, it eventually threatens to

208
00:13:27,492 --> 00:13:30,526
lead to a burnout, which is pretty much what happened to myself.

209
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:34,398
And yet again, I don't even think that the

210
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:37,538
term burnout was even popular at the time. So I

211
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:41,474
had no idea about it. So I kept accumulating this

212
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:44,900
debt, which obviously culminated with me waking up one morning

213
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,742
and feeling like I'd rather

214
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:52,166
die than go to the office for one more day, honestly speaking.

215
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:55,894
And I can't really remember what I did. Like,

216
00:13:55,932 --> 00:14:00,202
did I go or not? But what I clearly remember that soon

217
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,946
after that, I quit my job. I even broke up with

218
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,674
my long term girlfriend. I bought a motorcycle. I was

219
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:11,382
kind of having this assumption that I haven't

220
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:14,606
lived my life, that my work was limiting myself.

221
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:18,074
I wanted to be a playboy. I wanted to party,

222
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:21,214
live the life, which kind of, I did,

223
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:25,890
actually. For a couple of months. I was partying the whole time, driving my motorcycle,

224
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:30,946
living a bit of locker, pretty much, and that

225
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:34,126
was cool for a while. But obviously it wasn't

226
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:38,386
a cause. It was just one of the manifestations of burnout,

227
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:42,726
like, getting rid of the chains. And I wanted to do everything all

228
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,150
of a sudden. And this

229
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,074
lasted for a couple of months. And then I started waking up

230
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:53,210
again. And there's nothing crazy about these mornings, apparently.

231
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,522
I started waking up again, and I would wake up super

232
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:02,298
excited, like, yeah, let's rock the day. Let's do everything,

233
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:05,238
whatever. And then by the afternoon,

234
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:08,234
I would be like, my mood would completely plummet.

235
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,598
I would be like, what's the point of everything?

236
00:15:11,764 --> 00:15:14,730
Why am I doing thats? Why did I quit?

237
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,270
Whatever. And then by the evening again,

238
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,426
my mood would completely rock it again. It was completely crazy.

239
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:25,006
I would be like, yeah, let's go, let's go, let's drink, let's party,

240
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:28,750
whatever. All those kinds of stupid things and this stuff that's always

241
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,390
first. But over time, these oscillations actually started

242
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,166
getting more and more crazy. And it

243
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:40,700
came to a point again where I was literally feeling like,

244
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,986
I just can't go through one more day like this, honestly speaking.

245
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:51,462
And the funny thing about these intense emotions

246
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:55,182
is that about these thoughts and

247
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:58,686
memories of intense emotions is thats every time you

248
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,494
actually remember them, you can pretty much relieve them. So every

249
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:06,606
time I share this story, I kind of relieve it. And it's

250
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:09,794
still the same intensity every single time. It's pretty much the same

251
00:16:09,832 --> 00:16:14,034
intensity as on the first days. So this is generally a funny thing

252
00:16:14,232 --> 00:16:16,280
about mind itself.

253
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,310
So I eventually ended up,

254
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,178
like my friend suggested, that maybe I should seek professional

255
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:27,554
assistance. And I ended up in a therapy thinking

256
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,258
that I'm going to solve just this single issue

257
00:16:31,344 --> 00:16:34,714
of oscillating mood, whatever,

258
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:38,794
and this would actually convert into seven years, well over seven years of

259
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,960
active therapy. And I can definitely tell you,

260
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,118
going to a therapy was one of the best things

261
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:50,954
ever I did for my personal life, my relationships and my career,

262
00:16:51,002 --> 00:16:54,194
pretty much because years there were times when there

263
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:57,650
wasn't much progress. But overall I think it pushed me to do something

264
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,234
that some things that I would never even consider doing because of

265
00:17:01,272 --> 00:17:05,506
the self doubt. So obviously

266
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,270
I learned that what was happening to me was a burnout,

267
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,982
quite a massive one. And honestly speaking, if you never felt this,

268
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:16,520
like, if you never felt physically sick about going to a job,

269
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,490
I would absolutely advise you to do everything to prevent thats

270
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,722
because the feeling is awful. What I also learned has

271
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,420
that a lot of us, especially in software engineering or

272
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,902
in any kind of art, I would pretty much

273
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:39,214
say like anybody doing any kind of art

274
00:17:39,332 --> 00:17:43,154
creational work, could suffer from

275
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,318
this imposters syndrome and from perfectionism.

276
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:51,118
Perfectionism is a really big thing among developers.

277
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:54,786
And I'll give you a really quick self test to test if

278
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,434
you have the perfectionist. Thats so just think about

279
00:17:58,472 --> 00:18:02,870
it. Have you ever brought a piece of code that

280
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,662
was perfectly solving the problem

281
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:09,814
that it was supposed to solve, that was done

282
00:18:09,852 --> 00:18:13,734
in time, whatever. And yet, since you haven't hit the deadline, you actually decided

283
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:17,146
to rewrite it. And you kept rewriting it until you hit

284
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:20,566
the deadline. If this ever happened to you, and I'm

285
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:23,662
pretty sure that at least for most of you did, you most

286
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:27,530
certainly have at least perfectionist traits,

287
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,720
if not complete perfectionism. And this could be good.

288
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,654
Perfectionism could be good because it

289
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:38,226
forces you to improve yourself. But on the other hand, it can

290
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:41,538
be really exhausting because you never can finish the things

291
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:44,900
and it can be really a burden on your mind.

292
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,366
And finally, obviously, the third thing I learned is that there

293
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:52,690
is this concept of imposter syndrome,

294
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,226
which I had no idea about and which is pretty much what I'm

295
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:59,420
going to cover now, right now.

296
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,162
Funny thing about imposters syndrome itself

297
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:06,598
is that the term was coined

298
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:09,340
somewhere in late seventy s.

299
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,542
It was probably known before, but the official term was introduced in

300
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:17,790
late seventy s. And it was actually a result

301
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,438
of a study that was run with

302
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:25,506
around 150 highly successful women, believe it

303
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:29,394
or not. And what you have to understand is these

304
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:32,994
are the women who are highly successful in their work. They were

305
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:36,710
highly accomplished. They were recognized for their successes,

306
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,182
and yet by interviewing and

307
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:43,800
studying how they feel, all of them

308
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,914
on a higher or a lower scale, but all of them express some

309
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:51,846
feelings of self doubt, feeling like imposters,

310
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:55,850
feeling like frauds, feeling like they're all

311
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,722
having to wear a mask the whole day. And if they remove this

312
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:00,570
mask,

313
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,446
pretty much everybody would reveal what kind of frauds they are and things like

314
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:09,306
that. And this is really funny,

315
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:13,066
because obviously they were highly respected

316
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:17,154
for what they were doing, and yet they had complete feelings of

317
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:21,474
self doubt, which just obviously tells you that no

318
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,740
matter how successful you are, well, actually, the more successful you are,

319
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:30,120
the more intense feelings of imposter are.

320
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,726
Now, the study later has expanded and it

321
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:37,790
was concluded that it's completely gender neutral.

322
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,466
So it doesn't have anything to do with genders. Everybody have these feelings. And as

323
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,420
I said, the more successful you are,

324
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,810
the more intense these emotions and feelings of imposter

325
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,960
are. Now,

326
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,590
just in case you can't even identify it, I'll give you some ideas

327
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,734
of what some of the feelings of imposter

328
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:08,482
could be. So, for example, one very common

329
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:12,430
example that I keep hearing and seeing and feeling occasionally

330
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,066
is the job change. So many of us advance

331
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:20,120
through our career, especially in the same company, and yet

332
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,214
we sometimes tend to stay in the same company because we

333
00:21:24,252 --> 00:21:27,874
feel thats we feel pretty much lucky,

334
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:31,574
right? And we are feeling that our successes are due to the

335
00:21:31,612 --> 00:21:36,266
fact that we have been here for a long time, that if

336
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:40,106
you tried changing the job, it would turn out that we are not as good

337
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:43,566
as we think and stuff like that. So what I would like

338
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:47,406
to encourage you now is to go to a discord channel like

339
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:51,262
hashtag python. And I'd like you to give it a quick

340
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:55,130
thought, like what are some feelings of imposters

341
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,362
that you've experiences? Try to identify them. Try to write about

342
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:02,894
them. I encourage you to write about them because by sharing,

343
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:06,246
we should help others feel the same. And while you are doing that, I'll get

344
00:22:06,268 --> 00:22:08,440
a quick sip of water, if you don't mind.

345
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,740
I had to get a sip of coffee as well.

346
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,510
So I hope you brought some things.

347
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,830
If not, feel free to write them at any time during this presentation.

348
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,662
I will be more than happy to discuss it with you once

349
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:43,220
the presentation is done.

350
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,066
Apologies. So a

351
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:51,346
natural question would become like, okay, we all have

352
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:53,220
it, we all feel it, but why?

353
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,854
What is the reason that we have these thoughts, right? And what

354
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:02,434
I came to learn and conclude,

355
00:23:02,562 --> 00:23:06,082
both through therapy and through reading

356
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:09,702
and through doing some thinking and writing, obviously, is that,

357
00:23:09,836 --> 00:23:13,034
well, this is not my conclusion, but most of the things and most of the

358
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:16,134
manifestations of human beings are due to evolution,

359
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:19,674
believe it or not, pretty much lots of stuff

360
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:23,246
is all about making you survive and reproduce. And some

361
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:26,446
of you don't like it, I understand, but that's how it

362
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:30,238
seems to be. Now, what's the use of

363
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:33,514
feeling like a fraud, right? What's the use of feeling

364
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:37,314
paralyzed? To do anything, to move, to change job, to change

365
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:40,546
a partner, to start something new? Right? What could be a

366
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:43,890
benefit to this? What could be a benefit to feeling like a fraud?

367
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,226
And I'll give you sort of a counterexample,

368
00:23:48,258 --> 00:23:52,070
which I found really interesting. There was a

369
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,760
study,

370
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,582
lab study, controlled lab study

371
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:02,218
done in a lab mice. I don't really know the name of

372
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:05,770
the study, but I know that it happened run with a lab

373
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,754
mice. And they pretty much put electrodes to

374
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:13,406
brains of mice. And they wanted to see what happens when

375
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,906
they stimulated the brain parts that are in charge of releasing

376
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:21,882
dopamine, the neurotransmitter thats eventually

377
00:24:21,946 --> 00:24:25,394
makes you feel good about, makes you feel satisfied, happy, whatever.

378
00:24:25,592 --> 00:24:29,758
So they run this study, and they made these mice

379
00:24:29,934 --> 00:24:33,026
by external stimulation, obviously, by using the currents to

380
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:36,694
actually stimulate their brain, they made them feel good all the time.

381
00:24:36,732 --> 00:24:39,606
They made them feel happy and satisfied all the time.

382
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:43,206
And you might be surprised to

383
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:46,982
years that most or all of these

384
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:50,434
mice thats felt good and happy and satisfied

385
00:24:50,482 --> 00:24:54,310
all the time, eventually died from starvation.

386
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:58,074
Like all of them died from starvation because just by feeling good all the time,

387
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,822
they didn't have a need to actually go and search for the food, or to

388
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:05,406
go and reproduce, or to go find the food, whatever. They just

389
00:25:05,428 --> 00:25:09,070
felt good and they starved themselves to death.

390
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,574
Which could be, on one hand,

391
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:16,002
could be really weird to hear, because we all think

392
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,746
that we are all aiming towards this zen like

393
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:23,700
feeling whatever, which is stupid, to be honest, but that's a different story.

394
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,746
But this should tell you that the

395
00:25:27,768 --> 00:25:30,726
aim should not be to feel good all the time.

396
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:34,982
And the reason why you feel pain

397
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,358
and doubt and whatever is. It's a

398
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:41,946
complex process, but most of it is actually a natural mechanism to make

399
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:45,370
you move. And that's what I want you.

400
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,078
If there is one thing thats I want you to get out of this presentation

401
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:54,334
is that you

402
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:58,606
really need to change your perspective about all those,

403
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:02,218
what we call negative emotions like imposter syndrome after all,

404
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:05,698
because they are others, to actually

405
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:09,602
push you to change or to push you to

406
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:13,602
keep doing something, whatever. Because feeling of a hunger actually

407
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:17,610
pushes you to go find the food so that you don't die from starvation.

408
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,366
So most of the time, if you feel like an imposter in your

409
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:24,550
career, that's most likely a signal that you're doing a

410
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,774
good job, but you're interpreting it wrongly because

411
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:32,298
if you sucked at your job, you wouldn't feel like a fraud, right? Or a

412
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:36,070
cheater or whatever. So you're most likely feeling like sucker

413
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,834
because you're actually good at your job. So next time

414
00:26:39,872 --> 00:26:44,090
you feel the imposters syndrome and next time you identify this inner voice asking

415
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,742
you like, are you sure about thats? Or are you sure that's good?

416
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:51,502
Or are you sure that you can change the job or break up

417
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:55,022
or start a new relationship, wherever thats exactly means.

418
00:26:55,076 --> 00:26:58,494
That means that you are about to move out from your comfort zone.

419
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:02,066
And every time you move out of your comfort zone, that's actually a

420
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:05,954
good thing. Trust me. Now one

421
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:09,586
might ask, and rightfully so, but what if I'm paralyzed

422
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:13,026
by these thoughts, right? What if I'm completely paralyzed

423
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:16,166
by these thoughts of impulses that I can't even move?

424
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:19,466
So I obviously see a signal that what I want to do

425
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:22,540
is good, but what if I can't make thats move, right?

426
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,700
And that's exactly what you should.

427
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,586
Well, that's exactly what I'm going

428
00:27:30,608 --> 00:27:34,270
to talk about now. Like some of the techniques that you can use,

429
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,550
and by using them, you should be able to better

430
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,246
approach the issue, obviously. But in the worst case, you should always seek a therapy,

431
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,854
right? Like a professional assistance. So let's

432
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:51,620
talk about the imposter syndrome fighting tools. Now,

433
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:57,234
the first tool in our toolbox

434
00:27:57,362 --> 00:28:01,570
is the easiest one, believe it or not, and it's acknowledgment.

435
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,606
So what I really want you to acknowledge is that

436
00:28:05,788 --> 00:28:09,254
we all have it. We all had it and we will

437
00:28:09,292 --> 00:28:13,078
all have it forever. So imposters syndrome is not going anywhere.

438
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:17,226
It's others. It will be with you. And you should really treat it

439
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:20,538
as a mechanism that tells you whether you are on a more

440
00:28:20,544 --> 00:28:24,094
or less righteous path or not. So acknowledge it.

441
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:28,458
Everybody has it. Everybody lives with it. So you're

442
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:32,238
not isolated. We are all there. And I'm really hoping that some of

443
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:36,034
you shared something on the Discord channel. If not, now's the time

444
00:28:36,152 --> 00:28:38,994
to show everybody that we are in the same boat, right? So,

445
00:28:39,032 --> 00:28:43,394
acknowledgement. The next thing which I

446
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:48,066
really found useful and comforting is reading

447
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:52,022
biographies or autobiographies because nobody really

448
00:28:52,156 --> 00:28:55,526
reads biographies or writes biographies for that

449
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:59,414
purpose, about the people who were unsuccessful or know, like your average

450
00:28:59,462 --> 00:29:03,322
Joe from the neighborhood. So biographies are usually written about people

451
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:06,602
who actually did something like good or bad doesn't matter,

452
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:09,750
but they did something which was worth sharing.

453
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,262
And what you will learn if you read at least

454
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:17,198
honest biographies. Is that all? I won't say some.

455
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,022
I'll say like, well,

456
00:29:19,156 --> 00:29:22,640
99.99% of these people actually

457
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,890
felt quite intense feelings of impulsive,

458
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,546
felt like frauds, like whatever they all did.

459
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:36,446
The only thing that distinguishes them

460
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:40,466
is how they dealt with it, which are some techniques.

461
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:45,106
Some of them use some positive things, some use negative things like alcohol

462
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:48,874
and stuff. But overall they all felt it and they all were

463
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,394
searching and using some techniques to fight with it.

464
00:29:52,592 --> 00:29:57,066
Now, the technique that I

465
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:00,718
personally think is most useful and yet

466
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:03,978
most difficult to implement is discipline.

467
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:07,870
Believe it or not, discipline, from my point of view,

468
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,390
is absolutely the number one tool for beating

469
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,034
any procrastination, any laziness, any feelings of

470
00:30:16,072 --> 00:30:19,266
imposter. And it's actually really simple. And I'll give you

471
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:24,002
a perfect example. So whenever I'm about to start

472
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,206
writing new article, for example,

473
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:30,918
or whenever I'm about to involve myself

474
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:34,582
in fixing some incident or whatever, like anything

475
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:36,200
that is unknown to myself,

476
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,634
whenever I think about going that

477
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:46,140
route, involving myself in it, I would feel like,

478
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,134
can I do it? Should I do it? And there's this procrastination

479
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:55,614
and feelings of doubt. Whatever, discipline is

480
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:59,258
the best antidote. Because just by committing yourself to doing it daily,

481
00:30:59,354 --> 00:31:02,318
regularly, like for example, I'm going to write every day from 09:00 a.m.

482
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:06,178
To 10:00 a.m. I'm going to fix incidents every single day from

483
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:10,174
12:00 p.m. To 02:00 p.m.. Whatever. Just by being disciplined

484
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:13,634
and making yourself committed to it, you actually don't like

485
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:17,298
yes, you will feel these feelings of imposter, but still you just have to do

486
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:19,060
it. It's like going to a job.

487
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,574
You don't have to feel like doing it, you just have to do it.

488
00:31:23,612 --> 00:31:26,998
That's pretty much. So it's easier said. Thats done.

489
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:31,370
I agree. But you should really consider it has making yourself

490
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,730
disciplined. So it's not about becoming motivated, it's about being

491
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,442
disciplined. So commit yourself to, if it's a job change,

492
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,678
commit yourself to every single day from, I don't know,

493
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:45,822
06:00 p.m. To 07:00 p.m. I will send one job application

494
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:51,134
or if it's about writing every day from 06:00

495
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:54,318
p.m. To 07:00 p.m. I'm going to write whatever it is, but I'm going to

496
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:57,826
write even if it's just bullshit, I'm still going to write it from

497
00:31:57,848 --> 00:32:01,394
06:00 p.m. To 07:00 p.m. And trust me, the results are amazing just

498
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:04,706
by being disciplined about thats. Now a

499
00:32:04,728 --> 00:32:08,598
next tool which is quite underappreciated and yet

500
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:12,434
awesome is occasionally reviewing your successes.

501
00:32:12,562 --> 00:32:16,546
And this is really funny because we sometimes tend

502
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:20,074
to forget the good things that we achieved and we

503
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:24,122
always focus on things that we haven't achieved, which is good

504
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:28,214
because it keeps pushing you to do more. But on the other hand it's

505
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:31,946
bad because sometimes you just completely forget what you achieved

506
00:32:31,978 --> 00:32:35,534
at all and you really sometimes need to feel good about

507
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:39,406
what you already achieved. So one

508
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:43,578
of the things that I'm doing is I used to

509
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:47,598
journal Daily but I slowed

510
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:50,866
it down a bit. So I'm journaling maybe a couple of couple of times a

511
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:54,626
week. I'm using by the way, day one application

512
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:58,226
which is amazing. It's a free app, it's an awesome tool for journaling.

513
00:32:58,418 --> 00:33:01,798
But point is, just occasionally write good things that

514
00:33:01,804 --> 00:33:05,142
you achieved. Like today, I don't know, brought this

515
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:08,966
or I sent this many applications or I fixed this many incidents

516
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:12,746
or bugs, whatever. Just write down your successes and

517
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:15,530
schedule time like once a month,

518
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:19,466
once a quarter, whatever. Schedule time to actually review

519
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:23,018
your successes. Because you would be surprised how much you

520
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:26,826
are achieving and how much you're forgetting that you are achieving because you're

521
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:28,800
focusing what you haven't achieved yet.

522
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,440
And another one,

523
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,266
almost the last technique, the last but

524
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:41,106
not the least pretty much is doing something that you suck at

525
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:45,178
honestly. And this is definitely one that's

526
00:33:45,214 --> 00:33:48,534
easier written than done. But what's really interesting about

527
00:33:48,572 --> 00:33:52,454
doing things thats we suck at is

528
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:56,040
seeing how we improve. I'll give you an example.

529
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,594
I wrote an article about this actually with the same name, like do something

530
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:03,686
that you suck at. And I took it as a challenge to try playing

531
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:07,514
guitar and I

532
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:11,206
always did suck. And just by assuming that I suck,

533
00:34:11,398 --> 00:34:15,470
I never did it again. But I wanted to try playing guitar again.

534
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,422
And what is funny is that I has obviously all these feelings about

535
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:22,558
I will never learn it, I will never be able to do it whatever.

536
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:26,306
And that's still true. But what's really funny is when you see

537
00:34:26,328 --> 00:34:29,758
yourself having these feelings of doubt, of anxiousness,

538
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:33,266
of questioning yourself, and yet when you do it and

539
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:38,182
when you see yourself improve, like go from .0 point

540
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:41,766
of no results to points of some results, and when

541
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:45,426
you observe that you still have these same feelings of imposter,

542
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:49,690
you can actually feel thats no matter, you can improve.

543
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:53,994
That's when you can feel great about it and the imposter feelings will still

544
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:57,830
be there. So I think thats one of the best antidotes

545
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,290
for generally beating anything is doing

546
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,926
things that you think you suck at. You get

547
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:08,526
those beginner results and you learn a lot about yourself, which you

548
00:35:08,548 --> 00:35:12,286
probably forgot from the time that you were a kid. So take it

549
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:15,890
as a challenge and if you feel brave enough,

550
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,486
write it to a python channel, do something that you suck

551
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,914
at and tell us what it is. And finally, obviously there is

552
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:27,218
just no replacement for the ultimate king of fighting

553
00:35:27,314 --> 00:35:31,234
the imposters or anything. That's therapy. So as I said, I highly suggest

554
00:35:31,282 --> 00:35:34,402
it. I've been doing rational emotional behavior

555
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:37,810
therapy like crept ive also years positive

556
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,910
experiences with gestalt,

557
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,362
psychodrama and I don't know what there is, but whatever

558
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,994
it is, give it a shot and if you can afford it, it can

559
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:51,470
be one of the best things that you did for yourself recently.

560
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,254
Just take my word for it. And we

561
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:59,374
pretty much came to the end. I just like to share

562
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:03,474
a couple of books in case you are not feeling like doing

563
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:07,122
something that you suck at or going for a therapy. So I have four

564
00:36:07,176 --> 00:36:10,274
books here. I would obviously suggest a lot more,

565
00:36:10,312 --> 00:36:13,762
but these

566
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:17,666
four are nitpicks, so to say. So, first one is tools of

567
00:36:17,688 --> 00:36:21,494
titans by Tim Ferriss. It's a summary of,

568
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,186
I don't know, he interviewed a bunch of people, but this is a summary

569
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:29,494
of, I think 150 or 100 people, highly successful

570
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:34,458
people. And he summarized pretty much the interview with

571
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:38,010
their daily rituals, how they go through life,

572
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,886
how they handle the feelings of imposters. So just by seeing some

573
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,990
people that you definitely heard or know about,

574
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,302
how they deal with it and what they do, I think it's pretty

575
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:52,254
powerful thing to have

576
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:56,238
in your toolbox. Second book, extreme ownership.

577
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,666
Amazing book about owing everything that you

578
00:36:59,688 --> 00:37:03,314
do pretty much from how you dress to how you lead the team.

579
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:07,254
Absolutely amazing book. Changed a lot of my perspectives and gave me

580
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:11,346
some really amazing tools. So highly suggested give it a shot.

581
00:37:11,538 --> 00:37:15,062
Amazing book. If you're feeling for something more

582
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:18,842
complex and more in depth. There is just no

583
00:37:18,896 --> 00:37:22,874
replacement for thinking fast and slow. It's just

584
00:37:22,912 --> 00:37:26,570
a bible, literally a Bible. And pretty complex book

585
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,654
about how we feel and how we process

586
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:36,654
things and how we make conclusions and how

587
00:37:36,692 --> 00:37:40,334
to say if you engross yourself in this book,

588
00:37:40,452 --> 00:37:44,498
what you will get to learn is that our

589
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:48,340
thinking process is just incredibly flawed and

590
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,970
there are just some crazy things that you just won't believe but and yet

591
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,826
they happen again. Don't underestimate this book. It's really complex book.

592
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:59,762
It took me around four months, I think, to read it and it deserves

593
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:03,990
time and processing. So take it in a bite sized

594
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,480
session, so to say. And finally,

595
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,410
if you're a person who struggles with discipline or

596
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,330
forming habits or moving from a .0 to point

597
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,342
to moving, overcoming that static

598
00:38:20,406 --> 00:38:25,018
motion, whatever, getting that initial

599
00:38:25,114 --> 00:38:29,018
movement, others is just no replacement for atomic habits.

600
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:33,182
It's an amazing book. It tells you how habits

601
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:36,526
are created and what are some techniques

602
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:39,890
that you can do to help yourself create

603
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,518
some if you don't have them already. So four books,

604
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:47,510
absolutely highly recommended by myself and many people around

605
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,206
me. Go check them on Goodreads, go purchase them and let

606
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,998
me know what you think. And with that,

607
00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:59,094
I'd like to thank you very much for

608
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:03,014
watching this, for attending this conference. It was

609
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:05,400
an amazing pleasure to talk about this.

610
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,494
And since this is the first time I'm doing this lecture about this

611
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:12,814
topic, you can find this QR code on the

612
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:16,254
right hand side of the screen. If you scan it with your

613
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:20,266
mobile phone, it will take you to a Google form where it's

614
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:22,590
like a 1 minute survey.

615
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,206
You would do me an amazing favor if you let me know how I

616
00:39:28,228 --> 00:39:31,806
did, what you think about the presentation and what are some of the

617
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,586
things that I could improve. High appreciate

618
00:39:35,618 --> 00:39:39,382
it. I would really be thankful if you do it

619
00:39:39,516 --> 00:39:42,966
and that's it. I'll join you on the

620
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:46,774
Discord channel and let's discuss more

621
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:50,562
if there is anything more to be discussed. Thank you very much and see ya.

622
00:39:50,626 --> 00:39:50,770
Bye.
