00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,230
Hey everyone, today we are really excited to present this talk,

2
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,338
which is kubenation. And here we will be understanding

3
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:50,506
the architecture of Kubernetes in respect of an analogy

4
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:54,298
of a country. It will be really fun, it will be really visual.

5
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,902
So we are really excited to present

6
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,230
this talk to you all. So about us,

7
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,674
I'm Aakansha Priya and I'm currently a deverel at

8
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:08,446
empathyops. So I love going to meetups

9
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,806
and conferences, love hosting spaces.

10
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:15,574
And yeah, I also love

11
00:01:15,612 --> 00:01:18,790
to deep dive into new cloud native technologies.

12
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,586
And I'm Siddhant Khisty, a developer advocate at Siglens.

13
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:27,794
I am also one of co organizer at cloud native community groups

14
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:31,686
NASC and I love to geek out around Linux,

15
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:35,078
DevOps and various other technologies.

16
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:38,618
Recently I've also gotten into fitness and health, so if

17
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:42,046
you want to chat about that or just tech in general, feel free to hit

18
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,934
me up on Twitter. So before we get into the fun

19
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,454
stuff about actually building a nation, let's just get

20
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:53,270
a very high level overview of what exactly is Kubernetes.

21
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:57,374
So if you've gone ahead and googled a little bit around kubernetes,

22
00:01:57,502 --> 00:02:01,038
you'll hear that it's the de facto container orchestration

23
00:02:01,134 --> 00:02:05,050
solution. So thats. Does that exactly mean container

24
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,122
orchestrator basically means that Kubernetes is instructing

25
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:12,566
these tiny little things called as containers to go

26
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:16,390
ahead and do something now. For now all you need to understand

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,562
about containers is containers are a box which

28
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:23,434
do something. Kubernetes is also used widely in our

29
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:27,594
industry. Whether you go and look at a big company such as Google or

30
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:31,182
Microsoft or Apple or Netflix, they are all

31
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,862
using kubernetes at some level. It's also

32
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,926
a really great distributed system. That means that you

33
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:42,478
can use it using multiple computers. And these

34
00:02:42,644 --> 00:02:46,002
computers can be spread across the entire globe and it will still

35
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:50,078
work. But Kubernetes is also very complicated

36
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,340
and it's quite easy to get wrong.

37
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,006
You might type one single letter in the wrong way in

38
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:01,334
the Kubernetes configurations files, and you might have

39
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:04,822
just opened up an entire range of security errors or

40
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:09,254
performance issues. But we're not talking about Kubernetes today,

41
00:03:09,372 --> 00:03:13,082
so let's just throw it out of the window for now. And we

42
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:16,460
will be actually building a nation, right? It sounds interesting.

43
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,746
So we will be requiring a few checklist items.

44
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:24,366
And those are like six main items that

45
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:28,080
we will be requiring. First is land. Of course.

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,966
We can't build a country without a land, right?

47
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:35,394
Then we need some authority who will actually govern all

48
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:38,980
the actions that is being taken place in the country,

49
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,234
then we have people who will be staying in the country and working for the

50
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:46,614
nation. And we need homes so

51
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:49,974
that those people can stay. And of

52
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:54,214
course, all of this requires a communication set up. So we

53
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:57,854
require communication and then we need the hard workers

54
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:01,590
who will be building the homes and doing the communication

55
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,274
work, everything. So this is what we will be

56
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:08,858
doing. Now, why do we require a land?

57
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,206
As I mentioned, we need the land because we

58
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:15,902
need to build our foundation on it, and it has

59
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:19,662
all the resources, like the nutrients and minerals. And we need

60
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:23,054
those resources to build our homes or

61
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:27,460
supply food to our country people and so on.

62
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,074
Now, how to actually acquire a land? There are

63
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:34,962
a couple of ways. And first is that if you buy a land or

64
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:38,566
you can get like someone rents you the land, then you

65
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:42,210
can conquer the land. And of course not so suggested

66
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,430
option, but you steal a land. Now,

67
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,874
every country has a capital nation, which is like the

68
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:52,522
main city in thats main city, all the

69
00:04:52,576 --> 00:04:55,942
authority people who will be actually governing the nation

70
00:04:56,006 --> 00:05:00,054
will be staying there after the capital is established.

71
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:03,534
We need some cities, right? And so for example, we have

72
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:06,814
taken Park City, industrial city and the night city.

73
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,030
So if you are into gaming and all, you can actually

74
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,240
understand the reference of night City.

75
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,998
Now this nation will have some important stakeholders.

76
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:21,714
So the first that comes up is the president, who is

77
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:25,334
the face of the nation. He's the one who will

78
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:29,574
take all the major important decisions. So if

79
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:33,414
there is something that needs to be done for the country,

80
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:37,206
all that communication will be like all

81
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:40,458
the communication will go through the president, and all the important

82
00:05:40,544 --> 00:05:43,660
decision making skills will be in the hand of him.

83
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,914
So he basically governs the nation. Now, of course,

84
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:51,242
the president cannot run the whole country.

85
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:55,550
He needs some people who are in the lower hierarchy and manage

86
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,990
the nation. So we need some managers. And he makes sure

87
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,682
that everything is working properly, every city is working

88
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:06,242
properly, and people are

89
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:08,900
having no communication problems,

90
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,580
they are having no food problems and anything.

91
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,186
Now making sure that the nation is healthy.

92
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:19,560
So for example, if there is a terrorist attack or anything,

93
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,938
it ensures that the city is working properly and it's

94
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:27,954
in a stable state. Then comes the task manager,

95
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:31,546
who basically does all the micromanagement of the people who are

96
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:35,034
staying in those cities. He decides who does the

97
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:38,374
work, ensures that the task that is being assigned

98
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:42,266
to the person is being done, and also decides whom

99
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:46,590
to give which task and where to give that task. And now

100
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,914
all of this information is being stored

101
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:54,026
at one central place. So for example, I want to look back to the tasks

102
00:06:54,058 --> 00:06:57,538
that were assigned in that city or if something went wrong,

103
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:01,202
how it was called, I can actually go to that repository or

104
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:04,834
that central reserve and see thats what was

105
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:08,486
being done. So all the status, all the history

106
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:11,240
reserves of the country are there.

107
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,058
So now comes the home. This is a home. And there could be one person

108
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:22,330
who is staying or there could be multiple people

109
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,866
who are staying inside those homes. Now in the

110
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:29,446
city there will be of course a neighborhood.

111
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:33,694
So there are these four isolated homes and.

112
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:38,106
Right, currently they have no communication and totally isolated.

113
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:41,838
And in order for a city and a nation to work,

114
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:45,090
we need to have communication set up.

115
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,186
So we bring in telephones so

116
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:52,610
any house can contact the adjacent house,

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,974
right. Or even someone from the other

118
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:59,480
city. So that's how communications are being set up.

119
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,094
Then comes the hard workers who

120
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:06,706
will be actually building those homes and who will be actually setting

121
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:10,026
up the communication system. So when we talk

122
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:14,406
about builders, they ensure it's very self explanatory

123
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:18,106
that they will be building the houses. If the houses requires any

124
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,602
maintenance work, they will be doing those.

125
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:24,586
And they make sure that the people who are staying

126
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:27,934
in those home are safe. And of course

127
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:31,342
every city needs to accommodate every person who is

128
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:35,150
part of the country, right? So they make sure thats the accommodation

129
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,846
is well established in every city. Similarly,

130
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:42,526
it goes for the communication that all the telephone

131
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:45,734
providers or Internet providers are there in

132
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:49,462
every specific city. They make sure that everyone can

133
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:53,810
talk to each other. The messages are being delivered efficiently

134
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,962
and timely. If there are any communication

135
00:08:57,026 --> 00:09:00,902
rules that needs to be enforced, they are responsible

136
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:04,618
for that. And of course they ensure thats it is

137
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,500
existing in every city of the country.

138
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,422
So congratulations, you just learn the

139
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:14,862
entire Kubernetes structure in

140
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:19,178
a country form of way. But how it relates to the Kubernetes

141
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:23,362
architecture in technical terms, I will now pass

142
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,330
on to Sudant and he will be explaining that analogy.

143
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,930
All right, so I'm pretty sure you had fun.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,450
If you've played makes like Simcity, for example,

145
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,550
you probably could relate with a lot of the elements which we just talked about.

146
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,486
Now let's bring it back to technical discussions for

147
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:45,762
a while. Let's see how all these components

148
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:48,810
for a country are relating to Kubernetes.

149
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,730
So first of all, we had land. We explained land

150
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,498
as the foundation for building a country,

151
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:59,034
right? So in technical terms, this is just your

152
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:02,266
servers, your computers, you have your ram, you have

153
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:06,014
your cpu, you have your memory, you have your storage devices and

154
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:09,406
all these other things. These are the resources which we

155
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:12,910
are going to use for building our Kubernetes clusters.

156
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,682
So we have our servers. Right now every single

157
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:21,022
one of our cities is actually a server.

158
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:25,338
And in Kubernetes terms we call them as nodes.

159
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:29,334
Now the capital city, which we talked about, that has all the

160
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:33,938
authority figures in terms of, in Kubernetes terminology

161
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:37,682
we will call this as the control plane node.

162
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:41,146
In some other ways to refer to

163
00:10:41,168 --> 00:10:45,046
it, you might also call it the master node. But the control plane node

164
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,714
is basically where all your core Kubernetes components will

165
00:10:48,752 --> 00:10:52,254
exist. Then all your other node, all your

166
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:55,210
other cities are just some regular nodes.

167
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,794
Each one of these nodes is a dedicated server

168
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:02,786
or a dedicated computer within itself. Kubernetes at

169
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:06,702
the end of the day is just one control plane node

170
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:10,446
and multiple other nodes or computers

171
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:14,034
which are all being instructed how to work and how

172
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:18,262
to orchestrate containers. Again, at the start we mentioned that

173
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:21,560
containers are just a box that do something, right?

174
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,654
Now let's see, what exactly are these important

175
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:29,434
components within Kubernetes? The components that pretty

176
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:33,574
much govern the entire cluster. So let's start off with replacing

177
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:37,034
our president. We'll replace it with something that we

178
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,718
call as the Kube API server.

179
00:11:39,894 --> 00:11:43,422
Now the Kube API server is again pretty much like

180
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:47,530
the face of a Kubernetes cluster. The API server

181
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,514
is your entry point to a Kubernetes cluster. All the requests

182
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:55,650
that you make, all the actions that you make inside a cluster, they will all

183
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,530
go through the Kube API server.

184
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,542
Now from there you also have the controller manager.

185
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:06,090
Now like we mentioned earlier, the controller manager.

186
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,034
All it does is make sure that everything within the cluster

187
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:13,382
is healthy, everything is running. If it's not

188
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:17,074
working properly, it's the controller manager's duty to restart

189
00:12:17,122 --> 00:12:20,666
the process or heal the process. Then the

190
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:24,182
task manager, which in Kubernetes terminologies

191
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:26,730
is again called as the Kube scheduler.

192
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,222
The scheduler basically decides thats

193
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:34,160
actions to take and where to take them. For example,

194
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,362
if I want to run some action

195
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,870
in the park city node, the cube scheduler will

196
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,794
instruct the components within the park city node to do

197
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,266
it there. The scheduler makes sure that the actions are

198
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:52,626
not executed in some other city, right? And then we

199
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,086
have the central reserve which is just like a history books for the

200
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,254
country. In Kubernetes that's what we call as the

201
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:03,238
ETCD. Now in technical terms the ETCD is just

202
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,614
like a database. Like for example, you have a

203
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,378
SQL based database, you have MongoDB and all these other amazing

204
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:13,754
databases. ETCD is a database in

205
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,914
the same sense. But this one has been specifically created to

206
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:21,550
work well with kubernetes. Yeah, so as I mentioned

207
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,294
earlier, the homes and in these homes people were

208
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:28,506
staying. So these people are actually the containers.

209
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:32,790
And the containers are consistent like it's

210
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,130
inside a pod. And these

211
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,114
pods are represented by the homes, which is

212
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:43,746
in the city itself. Now we also mentioned

213
00:13:43,848 --> 00:13:47,474
that you need some sort of communication between the homes,

214
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:51,590
right? So we gave each houses its own telephone,

215
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,414
but now instead of telephones we will

216
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:59,366
assign each pod with a service. Now these services

217
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:03,114
are of many different types. You have a service called

218
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:06,618
as cluster IP, you have a service called as a node port,

219
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:10,442
you have load balancers and these are the three main

220
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:14,202
types of services within kubernetes. We won't go into the technical

221
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:18,302
details of each of the services, but they essentially just help

222
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:21,280
your pods communicate with each other.

223
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,310
Now let's talk about the hardest workers within a Kubernetes

224
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,502
cluster. So we talked about the builders and communication

225
00:14:29,566 --> 00:14:33,186
agencies who build your houses or rather build your

226
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,834
pods and establish your networks. So within a Kubernetes

227
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:40,502
cluster, the job of building all these pods and

228
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:44,290
running the containers within the pods is handled by a component

229
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,458
called as the Kubernetes. So this cubelet

230
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,574
is going to exist within every single one of your nodes. Whether it's

231
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,726
a regular worker node, whether it's your control plane

232
00:14:54,758 --> 00:14:58,838
node, doesn't matter. This Kubernetes will exist everywhere.

233
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:02,922
And the second component which is essential within a Kubernetes

234
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,762
cluster is the Kube proxy. The Kube proxy

235
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:09,962
essentially handles all your networking related

236
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:13,934
activities within the cluster. So again, just like the Kubernetes,

237
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:17,410
even the Kube proxy will exist in every single

238
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,946
node. And now we have

239
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:24,466
gone through all of the core components of Kubernetes and if

240
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:28,214
we visualize it, it looks something like this. So on the left

241
00:15:28,252 --> 00:15:31,830
we have the control plane with the API server, the control

242
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,914
manager, the scheduler, the kubeproxy,

243
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:38,906
and it also has the kubelet and the

244
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:42,230
ETCD. And then we have our regular nodes

245
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,074
which are our worker nodes. Thats is park city, industrial city and

246
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,278
the night city node. Now the control plane node

247
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:54,506
and the worker nodes, they can have absolutely any names,

248
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:59,054
you just need to give them the proper name and you can work with them.

249
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:03,002
So yeah, that's all for our talk. I hope you enjoyed.

250
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:06,234
If you want to learn more about kubernetes then we've

251
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:09,854
made a GitHub repository with a couple of resources and

252
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:14,042
we've also shared these slides in that GitHub repository.

253
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,254
So feel free to scan thats QR code to view

254
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:21,126
those slides. And you can also follow us on our

255
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,658
Twitter handles. They're right here. And, yeah, thanks for listening.

256
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,020
