00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,474
Hello, this is Ludovic Debas. I'm very happy to participate

2
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:28,322
to conf 42 to present Cryptpad,

3
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,790
the encrypted collaboration suite.

4
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,630
So who am I? I'm Ludovic Dubas, CEO of Xwiki SAS.

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,578
I'm the creator of Xwiki, which is an enterprise wiki.

6
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:44,406
It's wiki sis is a company based in France and Romania,

7
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:48,010
which has been doing 15 years of open source.

8
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,334
We're 40 employees at Xwiki and we could

9
00:00:52,532 --> 00:00:56,030
set a motto as make a living and contribute.

10
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,686
Xwiki SAS has launched CryptPad as a new tool four

11
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:04,820
years ago. So why actually

12
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:10,050
does cryptpad exist? So first, when it comes to

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,410
privacy, what we see

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,462
now on many websites is

15
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:20,998
we value your privacy. This is what

16
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:24,550
most websites are telling us. And unfortunately,

17
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,934
when you look and go a bit deeper, look at the privacy

18
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:32,330
policies and all the things that is happening

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,074
with our data, what they actually mean is that

20
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:40,446
they use and sell your data for

21
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:43,150
many things, either for advertisement,

22
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,334
either to sell our contacts or

23
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:52,486
to understand what exactly we're

24
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:55,220
doing so that they can sell us more services.

25
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,060
If we look a bit deeper and we look at the big tech.

26
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,418
So Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Amazon, Microsoft,

27
00:02:05,534 --> 00:02:08,518
what we see is what do they actually know about us?

28
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:12,678
And this has actually a very long list. They know everything

29
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:16,434
about our identity, but they mostly

30
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:20,074
also know a lot of things about us, our friends,

31
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:24,234
the data we share on their systems and everything we

32
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:27,626
do, including some things that we

33
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:31,162
don't do on their own website. This is,

34
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:34,826
for example, the example of Facebook that knows even what we're

35
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,894
doing outside of Facebook. And this list goes

36
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:42,126
on and goes on. So actually I took this list from security

37
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:46,260
baron, which made this list and compares a bit everything that

38
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,060
the big providers know about us.

39
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,166
That's the first problem. And the second problem is

40
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:58,520
generally more what about security?

41
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,362
What we see is that we're using more and more the Internet,

42
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:06,614
including for our work. We used to have most

43
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:09,846
of our work on our personal computer or inside the networks

44
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,578
of companies, and now we're having everything

45
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:17,066
on the Internet, on the cloud. And most of

46
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:20,870
this data is unencrypted everywhere. The transparency

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,094
of what's happening with this data and how

48
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:27,726
it's being protected or handled is

49
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:31,022
actually quite low. There is a lot of talking, but if we

50
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:32,800
actually want to know what's happening,

51
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,474
it's almost impossible. And of course we could

52
00:03:37,512 --> 00:03:41,234
also go back to some sort of self hosting or

53
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:45,038
use providers that are more ethical. Now, the difficulty is that

54
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:49,766
it's not actually easy for small actors or even yourself to

55
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:53,830
secure your own data. Like if you're running your own server,

56
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,520
it requires quite some experience to actually secure it.

57
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,834
Why did we actually do quippad? And so the

58
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:07,834
question that we ask ourselves is, what can we actually do

59
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:11,710
to actually enforce users privacy and security using

60
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,126
encryption? Is it actually possible to build a

61
00:04:16,148 --> 00:04:19,982
collaboration software that

62
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:24,354
take this as a key principle? And this

63
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:28,226
is how we ended up building Cryptpad as an

64
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:31,506
alternative to collaboration tools. Xwiki SAS is

65
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:35,300
a company rooted in collaboration, and so this is the type of

66
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,474
things we do at Xriki, like helping people collaborate

67
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:43,042
on. So we decided

68
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:46,918
to build a collaboration tool that is guided by

69
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:49,210
privacy and security principles.

70
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,482
And the correlation of this is that there is no business

71
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:56,906
model based on the user's data in what

72
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:00,586
we do. So what are the key principles

73
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:01,470
of Cryptpad?

74
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,466
We start by creating encrypted shared

75
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:11,086
documents that can be edited in real time.

76
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:14,210
So this actually comes from the history of cryptpad.

77
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,286
We were interested in real time collaboration. How can you edit

78
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,462
documents at the same time for the Quickie software?

79
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:26,374
And we realized that we were able to actually encrypt that real

80
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:29,734
time collaboration and use the server as just

81
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:33,414
storage of encrypted data, while the

82
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:37,126
handling of the real time collaboration was happening entirely in the

83
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:40,630
browser. So we decided to actually make a software

84
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,420
that would just work with the encrypted data.

85
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,246
The second key principle is that there is a management of keys.

86
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:52,314
Encrypted is the first challenge, and handling

87
00:05:52,362 --> 00:05:56,618
real time collaboration is a challenge. But the second challenge

88
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:00,522
of this type of technology is how do you actually handle the keys,

89
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:04,050
secure them and share them with other users.

90
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,970
And so we're handling these keys in personal,

91
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,970
shared, or team drives.

92
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,754
So every user has

93
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,274
a personal drive which is itself an encrypted

94
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:22,294
document, which is protected by your username and

95
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:25,670
password, for which a key is created.

96
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,726
And the personal drive is stored on the

97
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:34,520
server and will contain encrypted all the other

98
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,440
references to the other pads or documents that you have,

99
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,046
and the keys are associated to them. But we

100
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,546
also have shared and team drive. And so what's

101
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:49,086
interesting there is that while a shared and team drive is

102
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:52,462
a drive that is accessible by multiple users, so whatever you store

103
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:56,046
in that drive pad and

104
00:06:56,068 --> 00:06:59,714
keys will be accessible to the other users. So once you have

105
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:03,486
a shared or team drive between users, you're not only sharing

106
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,774
the documents, you're also sharing the

107
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:12,566
keys of these documents. And the third key principle is that

108
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:16,310
we have a system to exchange keys using personal

109
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,474
messaging boxes and this is using public privacy key

110
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:24,186
cryptography. So if you need to send a

111
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,706
document to another user, once you've been

112
00:07:27,728 --> 00:07:31,526
in contact with that user, you have his

113
00:07:31,568 --> 00:07:34,926
public key, and so you can send him a message, and he will receive the

114
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:38,880
message in his crip pad, and we'll be able to decrypt it.

115
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,682
In this message, there would be the document address,

116
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:48,740
the pad, and the key associated to it.

117
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,682
So what do we actually know about you

118
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:55,410
when you're using Tripad?

119
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,966
So there's a few categories, and we have a document on our blog. You can

120
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:04,338
go see our blog on this subject. And so there's

121
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:08,150
things we cannot avoid to see, but we actually don't collect.

122
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,530
And so this is ips and public keys.

123
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,930
So we do see the ips of our users

124
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,750
and what documents they actually request,

125
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,414
and we see the public key also associated to this

126
00:08:24,452 --> 00:08:29,070
ip. Now, we're not storing that connection, but ultimately,

127
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,910
if we wanted to do it as a hoster of Pippad,

128
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,398
this is what we could do. Then there's

129
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:44,034
other things that we store because we actually need it. So we

130
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:48,338
store the encrypted files, and these encrypted files are linked to the public keys

131
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:51,686
to the users. We also have the information of the

132
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,266
user's identity when they're paying users, because this is actually required

133
00:08:55,298 --> 00:08:59,374
by law. And we also have statistical

134
00:08:59,442 --> 00:09:02,922
information. So this is not information that we

135
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,906
necessarily would have to store first. This is information that we do see

136
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,670
the ips, the actions that people do on our servers,

137
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,586
and also information that users have allowed

138
00:09:14,618 --> 00:09:17,918
us to access. So, for example, we have

139
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:22,026
a telemetry setting where you can accept or refuse

140
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:26,290
to send us the actions that you're doing in the tool, so that no content

141
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,530
is actually shared at that point, only the actions and this

142
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,046
statistical information, including locations. And we're

143
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:37,458
very interested in that information because it's information that allows

144
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:41,014
us to understand how is cryptpad progressing and how

145
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:43,190
is it progressing in different countries.

146
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:50,138
And we could in the future record

147
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:54,310
that information less. But it's actually quite useful

148
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,100
for making prepad a success at this point.

149
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,486
And of course, if you host your cryptpad yourself,

150
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:05,118
then the hoster of that cryptpad becomes the

151
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:08,750
one that has access to this information and decides

152
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,520
what he stores or not. Now,

153
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,142
it could be possible to potentially have even

154
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:20,094
less access to this information, but it's quite difficult,

155
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:25,150
it's much more difficult to not have access to users ips

156
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,758
than that.

157
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:34,134
So this is things that maybe in the future could

158
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:37,910
be, can be continuously improved. Now, the thing is,

159
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,382
what we cannot know. So the first thing is we don't know your password.

160
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:46,650
We don't even know your username. So this is actually something

161
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,162
that's quite interesting, is that most websites,

162
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:54,746
one of the biggest problem is actually that you're sending

163
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:57,710
your password to the websites for verification,

164
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,920
while in Cryptpad, where we're doing

165
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,454
an authentication that is based on cryptography and

166
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:13,134
where your username and passwords are never leaving your

167
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,802
computer. So we're deriving key, and this key represents

168
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:20,790
data on our server. And the second

169
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,470
part of what we can't know is the actual

170
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,866
content of the documents that you're storing on

171
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:31,862
cryptpad. All these documents are encrypted,

172
00:11:32,006 --> 00:11:36,090
including the data, the titles, the metadata tags

173
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,706
or all this information. And this is

174
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:43,102
actually protecting your data way

175
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:46,622
more than potentially some collaboration software which

176
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:50,126
encrypted the content, like the text that

177
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:53,682
you could find in some data structures, but would

178
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:57,010
keep the structured data

179
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,010
around this data as non encrypted.

180
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,218
And so in cryptpad we've

181
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:09,174
went in great lengths to actually have as little

182
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:13,122
information as possible on the content that people collaboration

183
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:19,066
on. And so when

184
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,810
you're sharing your pad,

185
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,620
we don't know the name of the collaborator that you're sharing it with.

186
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,334
Now what do we actually have in Cryptpad and what care

187
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:35,566
the collaboration tools that exist. So I'll show

188
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,800
a demo of these. So we started

189
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,470
with a rich text pad,

190
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,226
which is a WYSIWYg document that you

191
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:49,826
collaborate on in real time. And we have a code pad where you

192
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:53,170
can do markdown and also include

193
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,630
some specific markup like mermaid, to do some graphs.

194
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,142
We also have a presentation pad which is again

195
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:06,950
in markdown, but allows to present as slides.

196
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,626
We have sheets which is based on the integration

197
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:16,918
of only office inside Quickpad. So it's Excel compatible.

198
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:20,734
You can export and import an Excel file and it

199
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:24,686
has quite good set of features of

200
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,870
Excel, similar to Excel.

201
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,550
We have a kanban, so similar to Trello,

202
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,190
where you can organize some tasks

203
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,500
in the Kanban form. We have a whiteboard and we have a

204
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,998
poll tool. And all this is organized in

205
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:50,066
a trip drive, so you can organize your content and add attached

206
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:53,606
files, pdfs or any types of

207
00:13:53,628 --> 00:13:56,982
file you want. And we have a team feature which

208
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,810
allows to share such a drive and including a chat

209
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,578
with a group of people that you decide. So let's actually

210
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:09,050
look a bit at these features.

211
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,514
And so if

212
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,640
I go to cryptrive here,

213
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,142
here you can see my drive with

214
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:25,890
folders. So I can actually organize this in folders,

215
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,666
this specific drive in my

216
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,202
folder list is actually a shared drive. We can recognize it using

217
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:36,518
the little icon. And so that means that I can actually

218
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:40,262
share that folder with

219
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:44,360
other users. So I can actually do that using the share button.

220
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,606
I can share by knowing the people and sending

221
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:53,226
them a notification in cryptpad on this. But I

222
00:14:53,248 --> 00:14:58,986
can also fabricate a link for

223
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:02,846
that access, either in view mode or in edit mode. So when

224
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,254
you're sharing a URL which gives

225
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,534
access to paths, you have to be careful to share it

226
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:13,490
in a secure channel because anybody that could read that

227
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,330
communication channel could access

228
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,386
to the information. The key point here is

229
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:26,466
the safest way and more secure way to share a

230
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:29,926
pad in cryptpad is actually having the

231
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:33,430
other person in your contact and share the pad

232
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,510
using the account that the person has on quipad.

233
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,106
So you have folders and we can actually also

234
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,022
attach images. So I can drag and drop files

235
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:52,320
in this directory. As I can see, I have some images there

236
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,142
and then I have some pads. So for our most

237
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:59,486
used pad is actually the

238
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:03,234
Wysiwyk pad. So let me actually take the example here.

239
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:05,540
Let's see if I have an example.

240
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,346
So this is a sample documents that we use to work to

241
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:16,786
show the common features. So this is

242
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:20,022
our wysIWyg editor. So you can type

243
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:23,640
content here, and so if you have

244
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,630
two users opening that pad.

245
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,300
So for example here,

246
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,546
if I open that pad in

247
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:36,810
a second window,

248
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,120
I can make changes here and these changes

249
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,320
will show up on the other screen.

250
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,254
And this wysIwyg

251
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:57,682
has quite a lot of features. You can insert images here,

252
00:16:57,736 --> 00:17:01,854
you can see an image and I can resize

253
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:07,334
the image. I can also use

254
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:11,266
bullet points, I can put equations

255
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:15,400
in the document, so I can chat around

256
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,094
the pad, and I can also comment the pad.

257
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:23,420
So if I select some content here,

258
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,394
I can add a comment, I will add a

259
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:32,490
comment here. And this is actually collaborative

260
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,934
because I can mention some other users and send them

261
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,094
a message telling them that I'd like them to do something

262
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:44,098
in this path. So there's quite a

263
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,634
lot of features. We have a history feature, so you can roll back

264
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:50,820
in case of difficulty, you can export import,

265
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,580
you can print, and this way, for example,

266
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,590
extract your pad as pdf.

267
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,434
Another type of pad that we have is actually the code pad.

268
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:06,680
So you're typing in markdown and you're seeing

269
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,626
the content directly there. What's interesting there is that

270
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:15,146
you also have color, auto colors, so you can

271
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:19,066
actually see who has typed what.

272
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:22,606
So if you have multiple users in your pad, and this is similar to a

273
00:18:22,628 --> 00:18:26,014
feature that exists in Etipad is

274
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:29,726
that you can see who has added content

275
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,390
in a pad. And this pad is

276
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,790
showing mermaid syntax, which allows to do some graphs,

277
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,040
including Gantt charts and things like that.

278
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:46,210
So we have also syntax coloring for other languages

279
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,874
and markdown, so you can actually see colors

280
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:53,926
also of the syntax so that you understand what

281
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:57,506
you're typing. Another type of pad

282
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:01,570
is actually a whiteboard. So this is actually quite useful

283
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,760
for education.

284
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,080
You can work in real time on,

285
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,774
on a drawing and show it

286
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:16,800
to somebody else during a video conference, for example.

287
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,294
Another type of pad is spreadsheets. And so this

288
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:24,866
has been quite challenging and is actually for us a

289
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:28,834
breakthrough is that we're integrating the only office

290
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:33,166
open source software which is built in JavaScript, and we're

291
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:36,850
integrating this encrypt pad. And everything that is

292
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,626
happening on the document is encrypted and stored encrypted

293
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:44,914
on the server and even including

294
00:19:44,962 --> 00:19:49,306
images. So it's possible to add images itself

295
00:19:49,408 --> 00:19:52,746
to your spreadsheet and they will be stored in

296
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:56,406
the trip drive and embedded in your spreadsheet documents.

297
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:59,706
And we also have an import

298
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:03,514
export feature. So if I do export

299
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:06,990
here, I can actually export

300
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,198
in Excel. And so this is actually

301
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,494
using webassembly because this was C

302
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:20,038
code in onlyoffice

303
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:23,986
to convert the document from the internal format of

304
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:26,450
onlyoffice to mid cell format.

305
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,498
Another aspect here is that it's

306
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:37,830
a spreadsheet. And for example it supports some graphs,

307
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,906
so you can see a chart based on the

308
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:46,266
spreadsheet data. Let me

309
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:49,926
see if I have some other things to show here on some examples.

310
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,066
So you can see we have

311
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:57,120
a pole and we have a kanban. I will actually

312
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,390
show this here going back in the presentation

313
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,166
in here we have

314
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:13,086
so the homepage of cryptpad that you can see, and you

315
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:16,886
can see that we have ended our storage limit on

316
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:22,194
cryptpad Fr, which is our hosted

317
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:25,574
cryptpad that we provide to the community,

318
00:21:25,772 --> 00:21:28,874
which also has a paying subscription. We have extended the free

319
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,454
subscriptions to 1gb during the COVID outbreak,

320
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:35,930
as many more users were actually needing online

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,900
tools. And so this is the drive again.

322
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,720
So this is the sharing mechanism. I showed that

323
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,470
the code pad, the Kanban, you can see this is actually

324
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,550
our squad Kanban,

325
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,258
which is showing the tasks on which the team is working on.

326
00:21:56,424 --> 00:22:00,030
You can see that it's quite extensive

327
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,650
roadmap, lots of work there. Now I'll detail

328
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,446
a bit what is planned in the future and

329
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:10,402
the spreadsheets, the whiteboard.

330
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:14,920
So now after this demo

331
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:19,126
of the live tool, what I'd like

332
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:22,966
to show is a bit the technological aspects of

333
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:27,014
cryptpad. So the first item of the technological

334
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,530
aspects of crypt is user authentication.

335
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:34,350
So when you log in in cryptPad, you have a username and password,

336
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,246
and use these username and passwords never leave

337
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:42,994
the user's computer. We're using script to derive a key,

338
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,878
and this key will represent data on our server.

339
00:22:47,054 --> 00:22:48,770
And this data is unique.

340
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,714
This allows to actually bootstrap your storage

341
00:22:55,762 --> 00:22:59,910
space on the Cryptpad server and then

342
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,426
will contain the keys of the different documents that you're

343
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:06,838
sharing. It's important to understand

344
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:10,234
that if you lose your password or even your

345
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:14,458
username, we, the hosters of

346
00:23:14,544 --> 00:23:18,234
Cryptpad instance at Cryptpad Fr, we are unable to

347
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,822
retrieve it. So it's really your job to secure this

348
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:25,626
properly and make sure you're not losing

349
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:28,702
them. Now,

350
00:23:28,836 --> 00:23:32,094
when it comes to the documents, what is happening is that

351
00:23:32,132 --> 00:23:36,114
every time a document is changing in your

352
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:39,586
browser, then we're creating a patch, and this patch is

353
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:42,914
sent to the server, encrypted using the key

354
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:47,062
of the document. And we have the changepad algorithm and

355
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:50,914
also some other algorithms which are used to handle concurrent

356
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,534
changes without the server being involved. So this

357
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:57,298
algorithm, the merging algorithm,

358
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,562
is making sure that everybody gets to the same results,

359
00:24:00,626 --> 00:24:03,702
even if they are concurrent patches that would be incompatible.

360
00:24:03,846 --> 00:24:07,562
So there is not 100% guarantee that your change

361
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:11,354
is going to make it through if you're in a collaboration session.

362
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:15,438
But what is 100% guaranteed is that everybody will be

363
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:20,286
at the same result in

364
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:23,666
the end. So there is only one possible outcome of

365
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:27,314
the collaboration. So for example, if you have a

366
00:24:27,352 --> 00:24:31,650
user that makes a change on a paragraph, and another user that deletes it,

367
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,714
the cryptpad algorithm will choose a

368
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:39,574
path that will be the same on

369
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:42,806
all clients. And so either it will be

370
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:46,406
considered that the change was

371
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:49,958
done before the deletion, either it will be considered

372
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:53,846
that deletion is done before the change, and in the end you'll

373
00:24:53,878 --> 00:24:55,020
get the same result.

374
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,518
Another aspect is that we're storing

375
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:06,478
old documents in quipad, including your drive, as a history

376
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:09,502
of patches. Now,

377
00:25:09,636 --> 00:25:13,134
in order to avoid coming back to the beginning of every document,

378
00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:16,500
so that we can reconstruct the current state,

379
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,742
we store a full version every 50 patches.

380
00:25:21,806 --> 00:25:25,010
So if you're working on a document,

381
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,042
the general principle is that we're sending patches.

382
00:25:29,106 --> 00:25:33,254
So if you're reloading a

383
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,334
document from scratch, what we will look for is the latest checkpoint and then

384
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:41,274
the patches, and we will reconstruct the state of your

385
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:45,226
document at the end of

386
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:48,522
the last patches, then all

387
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:52,042
document encryption keys are stored in your drive, and the drive

388
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:56,190
is a cryptpad document itself, which is protected using the same mechanism.

389
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,038
What is particular in the technology

390
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:04,734
of Quipad is that all the editors are fully written in JavaScript,

391
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:07,700
and we have no server component for any of them.

392
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,466
And so everything's running in

393
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,990
your browser and needs to run in your browser

394
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,146
so that we can secure

395
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:24,022
the collaboration. Now the question

396
00:26:24,076 --> 00:26:27,366
is, how far can this go? Like what can

397
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:30,458
we do with this technology beyond what it's doing today?

398
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:34,042
So I've shown in the live demo that we're already doing

399
00:26:34,096 --> 00:26:37,642
quite a lot of things well. We can go much

400
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,370
further in terms of integrating any editors that are building JavaScript.

401
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,082
We've already done some prototypes in the past to integrate

402
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:48,986
draw IO for example, and we also have prototypes

403
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:52,202
to integrate the other components of onlyoffice

404
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:56,622
for presentation. So PowerPoint

405
00:26:56,686 --> 00:27:00,930
compatible and word compatible.

406
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,298
These actually are quite close from working,

407
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:08,982
but we didn't want to launch them

408
00:27:09,036 --> 00:27:12,886
because the more pads we have, the more support we need to

409
00:27:12,908 --> 00:27:16,022
do to make sure that these all work very well.

410
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:19,674
And so what we want is first that spreadsheets is

411
00:27:19,712 --> 00:27:21,260
working very well,

412
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,330
that it can scale to many users,

413
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,786
and then we'll potentially deploy more editors.

414
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:37,850
There could also be contributors that work and support editors

415
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,680
that could run on the same platform.

416
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,250
There is also the possibility to build more advanced applications

417
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,566
that are built on top of the crypt storage. So we have focused

418
00:27:49,598 --> 00:27:53,250
on one advanced application which is managing your drive,

419
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,534
because this is actually something we absolutely needed

420
00:27:56,732 --> 00:28:00,694
to secure the collaboration on the pad. But you could also

421
00:28:00,732 --> 00:28:03,618
imagine calendars, blogs, wikis,

422
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:07,646
databases that are built on this encrypted storage, or surveys,

423
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:11,066
and we plan to work on some of them in the

424
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:14,454
future. But this approach

425
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:18,346
could be used for any type of application.

426
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:22,222
But you need to think differently when you build

427
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:26,320
them, because you need to build them with

428
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,982
the constraint that everything will happen on the client side and nothing

429
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:35,714
will be done by the server, which is not really the way most

430
00:28:35,752 --> 00:28:40,100
applications have been built in the recent years, where actually

431
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,894
all the providers are trying to build applications that they control on

432
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:48,694
which users are dependent. Another type

433
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:52,774
of things we could do is, and we've done some

434
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:56,322
experiments on this, is encrypted audio video conferencing,

435
00:28:56,386 --> 00:29:00,026
and we find it interesting because it's very interesting to add at

436
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:03,754
least audio conferencing around the document. When you're working collaborative in

437
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,020
document, it's interesting to be able to talk to each other.

438
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,294
And actually the cripat system can transfer

439
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:14,682
also audio and video data, and the browser

440
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:17,120
could implement, playing it.

441
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,080
Another aspect is,

442
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,914
well, we can go very far in terms of what we can build and

443
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:30,578
new things we can build. Now, the thing is, there is a lot of work

444
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:34,734
already to bring all editors and applications on par with non encrypted

445
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:38,550
applications. If we look at what we do in cryptPad,

446
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,546
we have a lot of applications like Wiziwig

447
00:29:44,578 --> 00:29:48,490
editing, Markdown editing,

448
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,090
only office compatible editing.

449
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,586
We also have a kanban, which potentially is a

450
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:00,118
competitor to Trello. And so all these applications,

451
00:30:00,294 --> 00:30:04,186
they compete with tools that have a very large range

452
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:08,000
of features, and some of them are not so easy to build.

453
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:12,590
And so there is a lot of work to bring these editors on par with

454
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,466
non encrypted applications. So we

455
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:20,450
need to also choose between the number of editors

456
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,230
and the quantity of features in the editor.

457
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,134
Another aspect is that users are also very

458
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:34,646
interested in mobile and offline access to these documents. So this

459
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:38,122
is a bit the difference between Google Drive,

460
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,490
Google Docs and Dropbox.

461
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,886
People are also interested to replicate

462
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:48,794
their data on their computer and to edit it,

463
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:54,414
potentially offline. And so there is also some

464
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:58,894
range of work that is significant to

465
00:30:58,932 --> 00:31:02,990
write mobile and desktop clients for Quickpack.

466
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,620
There is also advanced search that will be

467
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:13,170
an interesting challenge to build. And another

468
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,026
aspect is that it's possible to make cryptpad

469
00:31:17,138 --> 00:31:20,726
a decentralized service.

470
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:24,022
And so this is also an axis of work, and where

471
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:27,158
basically cryptpad instances would collaborate, and you

472
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:31,014
could have a user on one cryptpad instance that is working collaboratively

473
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:35,050
on a document with a user from another instance, and that's another

474
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,220
access of work for the team.

475
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,822
Now, what is actually our roadmap? So most of our roadmap is

476
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:47,198
built today on the fundings we

477
00:31:47,204 --> 00:31:50,880
were able to get for the project. I'll mention a bit that funding later.

478
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,034
And so right now we have received funding

479
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:57,760
from NLNeT and trust.

480
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,200
And so we're very grateful of that funding, which is allowing to

481
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,514
fund a very active roadmap. And so most of the developments

482
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,782
that we're doing care based on the

483
00:32:11,836 --> 00:32:15,986
roadmaps, on the developments we have proposed to these projects.

484
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:19,686
And so right now we're finishing up the communities project funded

485
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:23,286
by NLNEt, which already has funded the teams

486
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:27,286
feature in. So we're finishing

487
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:30,718
the project and we're finishing implementing document review.

488
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:34,122
So the comments that I've shown in the Wysiwave

489
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:37,806
pad have been funded by this project. We also

490
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:41,466
have improved in the administration panel,

491
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:44,818
and we're also improving documentation for users and

492
00:32:44,904 --> 00:32:46,530
instance administrators.

493
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,842
Then the second project we will be working on

494
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:55,714
is called SMC. Secure mobile communication. And the objective

495
00:32:55,762 --> 00:32:59,080
there is to develop a prototype Android application.

496
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,042
And this should also open a lot of things because relying

497
00:33:05,106 --> 00:33:08,570
there is work about making prepad more modular.

498
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,300
The third project is a dialogue project,

499
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,946
which we plan to do in

500
00:33:15,968 --> 00:33:19,814
the second part of this year. And the objective

501
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:23,406
will be to improve the current poll application and implement a

502
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:26,858
form application. So what we will implement in the dialogue

503
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:30,574
project will also open new possibilities in

504
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:34,014
terms of applications built on top

505
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:37,554
of the crypt storage. So we'll create some APIs that

506
00:33:37,592 --> 00:33:41,810
can be used by even more complex applications

507
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,054
in parallel. We're always working on

508
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:49,622
maintenance and performance. This actually has been

509
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:53,526
super active in the last six months, as I

510
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:56,886
will show with the usage of cryptpad, which has

511
00:33:56,908 --> 00:34:00,330
grown a lot, and particularly because of the COVID crisis,

512
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,890
we have done a lot of work on performance and we need to continue

513
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,378
to sustain the growth of usage, in particular

514
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:12,254
of the cryptpad fr instance, so that we can get more

515
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:15,726
usage. And so if we

516
00:34:15,748 --> 00:34:19,806
look at the Cryptpad fr usage, so we

517
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:22,800
have about 450 installs in the world,

518
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,074
including Cryptpad is our main

519
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:30,740
instance that is managed by our team.

520
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,362
And this instance has seen a tremendous

521
00:34:35,426 --> 00:34:39,206
growth when

522
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:43,622
the COVID crisis started because

523
00:34:43,676 --> 00:34:46,902
of in particular two types of users. One is people working

524
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:51,834
from home, so needing more collaboration tool, but also the

525
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:55,834
education space and schools which

526
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,126
needed ways to collaborate with students. And we've

527
00:34:59,158 --> 00:35:02,826
been able to see on

528
00:35:02,848 --> 00:35:07,086
Cryptpad that we had a lot of features that

529
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:10,554
were using Cryptpad. Another aspect of cryptpad usage

530
00:35:10,602 --> 00:35:14,122
is that Cryptpad is actually heavily used in Germany,

531
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:17,280
which is the first country where it's being used.

532
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,042
So this is actually not where the Cryptpad

533
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:26,582
team originates from. The Cryptpad team is, is actually

534
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:30,546
from a french company based in Paris. So France

535
00:35:30,658 --> 00:35:35,366
is also a big country of usage, but the

536
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:38,920
german usage is actually much higher.

537
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,206
Since the cryptpad crisis, we've reached about 50,000 users

538
00:35:45,238 --> 00:35:49,322
per week and 350,000 pads open

539
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,974
in a week. And this was actually four

540
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:56,320
times higher than what we had before.

541
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,166
So what we have seen also is that the

542
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:04,826
usage of cryptpad has grown a lot

543
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:08,386
in the US. First it has grown because of COVID and then it has

544
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:12,546
also more than doubled in

545
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:16,586
the last two weeks. And we believe that this is linked to the project

546
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:20,774
in the US and to some

547
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:24,626
users recommending the usage of encrypted

548
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:27,898
tool. If we look at

549
00:36:27,984 --> 00:36:30,380
the usage of cryptpad over three years,

550
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,942
we can see that the effect of the COVID crisis

551
00:36:36,006 --> 00:36:39,610
on the amount of pads open on cryptpad,

552
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,760
where we went in a year,

553
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,782
almost tenfold but in the year before, we were

554
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:52,320
already growing two, three times.

555
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,438
And another thing we see is that we see that many of our users

556
00:36:57,454 --> 00:37:01,134
are actually recommending other users to use prepad,

557
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:06,226
and we're very grateful for that. And it really helps spreading

558
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,786
the usage and showing that it's

559
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:15,186
possible to actually use more privacy friendly

560
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:19,190
tools for collaboration. This data

561
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,570
that I'm showing is only based on the CryptPad LFR data,

562
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,946
and we also have other instances, so there

563
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:29,034
is 450 other instances and on which

564
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:33,006
we don't have detailed data on the

565
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:37,130
usage. The Cryptpad

566
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,878
team is currently three full time developers, so it's actually not a

567
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,930
very big team which is handling the development

568
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:48,370
and also handling the main crippled FR instance.

569
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,802
The team receives some support from the Suksis team,

570
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:56,422
so from human resources, from marketing, and also

571
00:37:56,476 --> 00:38:00,226
from me. We have more than 400 independent

572
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:04,470
instances, and we have a community of users and some administrators

573
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,360
that are participating through our matrix channel and

574
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,522
that are also helping promoting cryptpad.

575
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,902
Cryptpad wouldn't be what it is without the promotion

576
00:38:14,966 --> 00:38:18,234
of all the other users that are making it

577
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:21,850
known. So when it comes to

578
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,614
the cryptpad funding, and I believe that it's very important to talk

579
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:29,278
about the funding of open source tools, because it's very important

580
00:38:29,364 --> 00:38:32,846
to have open source tools. We're strong believers of open source tools,

581
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:36,194
but it's really hard to get

582
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:39,410
open source tools if we don't manage to fund them properly.

583
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:44,402
So CryptPad originated initially from a

584
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:48,406
french funded project by be. So it's a

585
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:54,214
state organization. Funding R and D out

586
00:38:54,252 --> 00:38:58,454
of this project was

587
00:38:58,492 --> 00:39:01,180
funding Ipswichi and some other companies.

588
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,290
This is how we got Cryptpad bootstrapped.

589
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,034
At the end of March 2019,

590
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:13,502
this funding ended, and we needed

591
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:17,022
to find some ways to continue that project. And we've been happy

592
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:21,150
to candidate to the NGI

593
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,886
pet Zero fund. And NLNet has funded

594
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:29,170
multiple projects that are improving Cryptpad,

595
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,500
and we also got a funding from NGI Trust,

596
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,446
which has helped us complete the funding for the

597
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:40,854
year. We also have

598
00:39:40,892 --> 00:39:44,806
been happy to receive a ten k dollar grant from

599
00:39:44,828 --> 00:39:48,562
the Mozilla Open source fund when we candidated

600
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:53,674
to it that cost them this

601
00:39:53,712 --> 00:39:57,546
year. This is actually very interesting because it

602
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:01,754
has allowed us to fund the team that was working

603
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,486
on cripple and to be able to continue to fund them now.

604
00:40:05,668 --> 00:40:10,206
What is also very important is what kind of long term funding we're able

605
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:14,000
to build. So we have a few

606
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,178
strategies in place for that. So the first thing is that Cryptalfr is

607
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:21,394
a pain service, and for us it's really important

608
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:24,242
to build it right away as a paid service.

609
00:40:24,376 --> 00:40:27,974
Unlike many, many cloud services that are starting for

610
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:31,474
free, initially, trying to reach millions of users,

611
00:40:31,522 --> 00:40:35,346
and then are making users discover the paying scheme.

612
00:40:35,538 --> 00:40:40,314
For us, we believe that it was really important to

613
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:43,674
show how we believe that we can fund that

614
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:47,914
project long term. So we need funding so

615
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:50,858
that we can get the software off the ground,

616
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:54,862
but then we need a model where it can be sustained over time

617
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:58,762
and we can build a team regularly.

618
00:40:58,826 --> 00:41:01,630
As users have increased,

619
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:06,100
we've increased subscribers, and we've reached now

620
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,370
170 subscribers.

621
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,466
So now we've reached 170 subscribers on

622
00:41:18,488 --> 00:41:23,074
the CryptPad, for instance, which represents €1000

623
00:41:23,122 --> 00:41:26,098
per month of subscriptions.

624
00:41:26,274 --> 00:41:29,106
And we also have an open collective.

625
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:32,950
Cryptpad is one of the popular projects on open Collective,

626
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,486
and we have 150 donators on open collective

627
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:38,860
that represents €500 per month.

628
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,094
All this is evaluated as about twenty k euros for

629
00:41:44,132 --> 00:41:47,806
220. Now, it's important to

630
00:41:47,828 --> 00:41:51,278
understand that this is still ten weeks away from being able to completely

631
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:54,642
fund the team only based on revenue, and not being

632
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:58,366
relying on grants to be able to sustain

633
00:41:58,398 --> 00:42:01,842
the development. And now we believe

634
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:05,906
that it's possible to continue to increase the usage of

635
00:42:06,008 --> 00:42:09,494
the main crypt instance and increase both

636
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:13,110
subscribers and donators. And there's also possibilities

637
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,774
to package support services for enterprise

638
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:21,178
instances, which could also bring some revenue to help fund the

639
00:42:21,184 --> 00:42:24,394
technology. Well, we welcome any

640
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:28,970
help that it can be. We welcome also contributors

641
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:33,514
that would want to help in continuing

642
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:35,520
to improve this product,

643
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:41,582
and also administrators that want to host instances and make

644
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:45,518
prepad more known and propose a

645
00:42:45,524 --> 00:42:49,440
solution so that we're using less

646
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,506
non privacy friendly tools and we're using more tools

647
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:58,054
that are protecting our data and our privacy. Thank you very

648
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:01,382
much, and I've been really happy to participate to this

649
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:05,122
Conf 42 conference, and I hope you appreciated

650
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:06,040
this talk.
