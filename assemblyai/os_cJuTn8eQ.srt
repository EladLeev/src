1
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,080
Um,

2
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,282
hello everyone. Glad to be back at Sreconf.

3
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,126
Went 22 and thanks for inviting me again this years to

4
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:26,190
speak. I hope that that means that I wasn't too boring last year round.

5
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,366
And this year I'd like to talk to you about the state of DevOps and

6
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:33,200
observability in 2022.

7
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,530
I'm going to use the data from DevOps Pulse.

8
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,594
This is the years survey that we run at blogs IO,

9
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:46,102
my company. Essentially it's a questionnaire that people like

10
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:49,802
you answer. Over 1000 people

11
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,738
answered the last surveys from various companies, all the

12
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:57,990
way from startups with dozen employees to enterprises

13
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,134
with 5000 employees or more from different

14
00:03:01,172 --> 00:03:03,310
countries, different industries.

15
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,598
First, I'm really glad to say I was

16
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:11,950
very enthusiastic to see that on the gender diversity side,

17
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,110
we're improving. On the last survey I said,

18
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,614
and I shared, that 86% of those who answered were male.

19
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:23,122
And this year I'm glad to say that only

20
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:26,650
79% are male and we have 15% female.

21
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,066
So encouraging. And also you got the first stat

22
00:03:30,098 --> 00:03:33,810
of the survey. The survey covers many areas.

23
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,382
In this very short talk, I'd like to use

24
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:40,994
the coming minutes to look into some common assumptions

25
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:44,918
around cloud, cloud native and DevOps on

26
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:48,406
what people use, what the issues are, what the

27
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:52,142
solutions they used, and check how these assumptions hold

28
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:54,510
true in light of the results.

29
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,594
A word about myself. My name is Dotan Horowitz.

30
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,026
I'm the principal developer advocate at

31
00:04:05,048 --> 00:04:08,542
Logs IO. At logs IO, we provide a cloud native

32
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:12,206
observability platform that's based on popular open source

33
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:15,342
stacks such as elasticsearch, OpenSearch processes,

34
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:18,360
Jaeger, open telemetry and so on.

35
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:23,442
I've been around for quite some time, both as a developer,

36
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,390
a solutions architect, a product manager.

37
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,970
I'm also an advocate of open source software, open standards and

38
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,682
communities in general, and the CNCF, the cloud

39
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:37,340
Native computing Foundation in particular.

40
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,914
I co organize the local CNCF chapter in Tel Aviv.

41
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:44,986
So if you're around, do join one of our monthly meetups.

42
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:49,226
I also run a podcast called Open Observability talks,

43
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:53,470
so if you're interested in open source DevOps observability,

44
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,826
do check it out on all your favorite podcast apps. And in

45
00:04:57,848 --> 00:05:00,930
general, you can find me everywhere at Horvitz.

46
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,866
So if you are treating anything interesting out of this talk, do feel

47
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,214
free to tag me. And let's go straight to the

48
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:09,590
first assumption.

49
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,750
Everybody is in AWS.

50
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,470
What do you think? True false.

51
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,570
It was very clear on the survey, AWS still rules.

52
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,370
And in fact, in this survey,

53
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,162
AWS has increased its market share from 66%

54
00:05:35,296 --> 00:05:39,274
last survey to 71 this

55
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:42,250
time around who run there in AWS.

56
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,970
Also, Azure and Google Cloud have significantly bumped up their adoption,

57
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,634
from around 1112 percent on the last survey

58
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:55,054
to around 30 this time, as you can see. In fact,

59
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:58,314
last time Azure was second place on this survey,

60
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,826
Google Cloud runs second place. So 32 on

61
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:05,540
the Google cloud and 29% on Azure, as you can see.

62
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,230
And still, we need to remember that they're still behind

63
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,926
AWS quite significantly, and most

64
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:17,410
of the rest are pretty much non existent.

65
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,382
Perhaps vMware, as you can see, is showing some strong

66
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:24,890
signs. So that's about public

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,586
clouds and cloud infrastructure. And let's go

68
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:30,250
on to the next assumption.

69
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,550
Everything is containerized.

70
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,590
What do you think? True false.

71
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,466
Ah, it's definitely happening. Over 50% said

72
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:53,410
that more than half of their apps are containerized, and more

73
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,486
impressive is that 30% said that over three four of their apps

74
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:01,670
are containerized. So that's pretty very impressive.

75
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,682
And do remember, it's not just young startups

76
00:07:05,746 --> 00:07:09,666
who answer this survey, but also enterprises with 5000 employees

77
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:13,420
or more. So it's definitely happening across the board.

78
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,506
And if we talk about containerization, then obviously the

79
00:07:18,528 --> 00:07:21,050
next topic is kubernetes.

80
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,570
So let's go on to the next assumption.

81
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,826
Kubernetes. A piece of cake.

82
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:32,910
Just give me Yaml and I'll manage your containers.

83
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,070
What do you think? True false.

84
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,774
Not really true. People reported challenges

85
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:49,858
across the board. The top difficulties that people reported in

86
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:54,258
this survey were with security and with monitoring and troubleshooting.

87
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:58,514
But people also reported issues with networking and cluster management

88
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:02,200
and storage. You name it, you can see that here on the screen.

89
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,974
In short, everyone's moving to containers,

90
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:09,194
as we've seen, but still don't know

91
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:13,974
how to manage them, how to do it right. Simple production

92
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:17,406
ready. And as we

93
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:21,386
said, monitoring and troubleshooting is a top challenge. Which leads

94
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,230
me to the next assumption.

95
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,886
Monitoring and troubleshooting. Just use metrics

96
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,154
and logs, you fool. What's new? We've being doing that

97
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:36,580
for ages. Right? Right.

98
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,276
Indeed. Logging metrics are still

99
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,256
the most common. 80 90% use them. Not surprising,

100
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:53,052
as you can see here. If you summarize, there's another bar here

101
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:57,068
on all of the above. So if you summarize the basis for the specifics

102
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:00,720
and the bar with all of the above, you'll see that it's around 88%

103
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,930
for logs, 80% for metrics. So definitely there.

104
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,272
Interestingly, distributed tracing increases its adoption

105
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,308
with around 48%. Nearly half

106
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:18,428
of the companies doing something with distributed tracing.

107
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,400
So that for me was astonishing.

108
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,828
And it actually continues the strong momentum trend we've

109
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:29,592
seen in the previous year's surveys. So 48%

110
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:33,308
this year, 26% on the last survey, and 19% the

111
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:36,620
year before that. So you can definitely see the trend.

112
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,884
It's happening. This is where the tracing is having a

113
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:45,520
very strong momentum. Another interesting

114
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,384
thing here to mention is APM that,

115
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:51,330
although perceived as traditional tools,

116
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,008
is used vastly 43% of

117
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:58,452
the users use APM. And maybe the most

118
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:01,812
impressive on this year's survey, at least for me,

119
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:05,556
is that 21% use all of

120
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:08,492
the above. More than fifth.

121
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:11,748
One fifth of the people use all of the above. And that's

122
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,576
a significant step towards adoption of

123
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:19,592
full observability. I've been preaching for that for

124
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:23,636
quite some time, and if you read my blogs and articles and podcasts

125
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:28,052
and everything, and it's really, really encouraging to see that people realize

126
00:10:28,116 --> 00:10:31,464
that logs are not enough, even not logs and metrics, and you

127
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:35,344
need the combination of signals and the correlation of data to

128
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:38,610
actually gain observability into your system.

129
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,964
And going back to the trend

130
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:47,444
around distributed tracing adoption, among those

131
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:49,888
who don't yet use distributed tracing,

132
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:53,460
70% are planning to start using it

133
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,396
in the coming one or two years.

134
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:57,110
70%.

135
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,504
So, to summarize, tracing definitely

136
00:11:02,702 --> 00:11:06,900
stands out as a central tool for monitoring microservices undistributed

137
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,596
systems, of course augmenting logs and metrics

138
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,948
as we, as we said, and to be honest, we've seen a

139
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:17,784
strong momentum also on past surveys and people expected adopting

140
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:21,080
it very quickly. We've seen slightly slower

141
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,328
adoption than expected. However, you've seen the numbers, it's definitely

142
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:28,976
picking up. And let's move on

143
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:30,640
to the next assumption.

144
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,040
We're getting better on our MTTR,

145
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,020
the meantime to resolution or meantime to recovery.

146
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,950
True? False. What do you think?

147
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,652
When we asked people on the survey,

148
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:55,160
68% said that they're getting better

149
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,400
with MTTR. You can see here the the breakdown 14%

150
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,436
said that they greatly reduced MTTR,

151
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:06,488
23% said they were making great strides in reducing MTTR,

152
00:12:06,584 --> 00:12:11,004
31% said that they're slowly making progress, but still

153
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:15,020
68% indicated that they're improving

154
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,032
on their MTTR. That's very,

155
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:21,090
very positive and encouraging answer, right?

156
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,564
However, the actual MTTR numbers are,

157
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:30,100
how shall I say it, less optimistic.

158
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,004
When we actually asked the numbers around 64%

159
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,496
of the surveys, respondents reported that

160
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:43,352
their MTTR during production incidents was over an

161
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:47,204
hour. Over an hour, 64% nearly

162
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:51,032
two thirds of the people. And if you

163
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:55,468
compare that to last year, it's increased from 47%

164
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:59,868
last report to 64% this year. So it's not just high,

165
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:03,980
it's also increasing in a very, very fast pace.

166
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,976
So I'm not sure how better we are

167
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:12,160
getting at this at the MTTR reduction.

168
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,616
So let's summarize the takeaways. So far we've

169
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:23,824
seen that everyone's moving the workloads to containers

170
00:13:23,872 --> 00:13:27,812
and to kubernetes, but still experiencing many

171
00:13:27,866 --> 00:13:32,020
challenges operating kubernetes in production. The top challenges

172
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,020
were with security and with monitoring and troubleshooting.

173
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,690
Around a third of their respondents reported that

174
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,616
we also far from taming the MTTR,

175
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:48,652
in fact it's increasing, perhaps as a side effect

176
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:52,152
of the growing adoption of kubernetes and cloud native

177
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:55,996
architectures. And we've seen nearly two thirds

178
00:13:56,028 --> 00:14:00,720
of the people take more than an hour to

179
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,864
reach the full recovery. And speaking about

180
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:08,496
monitoring challenges, distributed tracing is rising

181
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:12,096
in popularity for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices,

182
00:14:12,288 --> 00:14:14,708
alongside logs and metrics, of course.

183
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:18,868
And also we've seen that more people use

184
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:22,500
full observability leveraging logs, metrics,

185
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,376
traces and APm. Over one fifth of the

186
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,576
people, 21%, are already using all of the

187
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:33,916
above. So that's it for

188
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:37,164
this survey. But wait,

189
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:41,144
what about security? What about data volumes,

190
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:44,720
cost, open source team structure?

191
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,780
Don't worry, you can find the full survey

192
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,492
in this link with all of these, the above topics,

193
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:56,064
and even more so do check it out. I prepared a

194
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:59,796
short link for you so it'd be easy to remember. Or you can just

195
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:03,312
take a screenshot bitly DevOps

196
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:07,136
2022 and you can find the full results

197
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:10,596
there. You can also look at and see the surveys

198
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:14,264
from past years. So interesting to also see the trends over year

199
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:17,720
over year. And of course

200
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,672
you're more than welcome to share your feedback. You can find me at

201
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:25,288
Horowitz Horovits. So if you

202
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:29,688
have any feedback on the survey, on the talk,

203
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:33,360
on my insights, or my maybe misinterpretation of the

204
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,068
or anything else, feel free to reach out to me at Twitter

205
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:41,056
LinkedIn medium, whichever. I'd be more than happy to

206
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:45,104
catch up. I'm Dotan Horvitz and thank you very much

207
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:45,580
for listening.
