1
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,950
Um,

2
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,014
hello everyone. My name is Paul Marsicovetere and today

3
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:21,326
I'm going to talk about combat sports principles that apply to

4
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:24,734
site reliability engineering. So a little bit about myself.

5
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:28,206
I'm senior cloud infrastructure engineers engineer at Formidable in

6
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:31,200
Toronto and I've been here since October 2020.

7
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,246
Formidable partners with many different companies to help build

8
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:39,202
the modern web and design solutions to complex technical

9
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:42,482
problems. Our key values are inclusion,

10
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:46,454
autonomy and craft, and we have a sizable open source community thanks

11
00:02:46,492 --> 00:02:49,430
to products like Victory, Urkel and Spectacle.

12
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,386
Previously I was working in SRE for Benevity in

13
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:56,486
Calgary for three years, and while I'm originally from Melbourne,

14
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:59,882
Australia, I've been living happily in Canada for over ten

15
00:02:59,936 --> 00:03:04,026
years now. You can get in touch with me on Twitter at paulmasi

16
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,886
Cloud on LinkedIn and via email. I'm always open to

17
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:10,730
chat with anyone about anything cloud computing,

18
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,702
SRE DevOps, and certainly about anything related to

19
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:18,830
MMA and boxing. I also run a serverless blog

20
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,926
called the cloud of my mind in my spare time as well. So combat

21
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,546
sports and SRE are not areas that would typically be associated

22
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:30,214
with one another. And let's face it, combat sports like boxing and

23
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:33,686
MMA are never typically associated with tech,

24
00:03:33,788 --> 00:03:37,414
software engineering or systems administration as well.

25
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:42,054
Specifically, these two things are not quite the same in SRE.

26
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:46,246
We don't have to worry about protecting ourselves at all times or sustaining

27
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:50,300
any bodily injuries, depending on which company you work for, of course.

28
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,638
However, there are some principles from the combat sports world

29
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:58,494
that have quite an interesting application to our professional lives in

30
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:02,126
SRE. Today, I'll demonstrate five of

31
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:05,874
these combat sports principles, along with some examples of how

32
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,602
these specifically apply to SRE. So let's get started

33
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:13,374
with number one. Sometimes you wear the hammer, sometimes you wear the nail.

34
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:17,634
What exactly does this mean in combat sports terms?

35
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:21,238
This means that in some fights you will be the one winning and punching your

36
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:24,982
way to victory, but in the next fight, it might just be your turn

37
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:28,834
to be on the losing end. It's important to roll with the punches,

38
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:32,140
as you might find yourself as the nail from time to time.

39
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,882
For SRE, due to the complex nature of senior

40
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:39,242
senior senior cloud infrastructure engineer, you are never too far

41
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:43,520
away from your next outage or difficult incident at any given time.

42
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,406
However, it's important to remember that when things are

43
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:51,102
being very well or very poorly, that the inverse is always

44
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,510
right around the corner. We can all have those days

45
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,954
where things can be going incredibly well and the updates and

46
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:01,022
changes that you are making are helping tremendously.

47
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,914
These updates and changes could be adding an extra AZ zone for

48
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:08,402
redundancy, optimizing slow database queries,

49
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:12,354
or putting together a backup and restore solution that you are confident

50
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:16,102
in during disaster recovery. This would be us

51
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:19,494
in SRE being the hammer. However,

52
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:23,574
outages such as cloud vendor or cloud servers unavailability

53
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:26,794
can and will happen. Full regions can go

54
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:30,010
offline or be intermittently unavailable

55
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,310
or your DNS cloud be completely unavailable.

56
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,778
Those days are when we are not the hammer,

57
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:41,054
we are definitely the nail like combat sports in

58
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,382
SRE, you need to roll with the punches. Your next

59
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:48,254
outage is never far away and as best you try, you cannot

60
00:05:48,302 --> 00:05:51,346
prevent or architect around each and every one of

61
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:54,802
them. There are going to be busy and complex days,

62
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:58,342
situations and incidents where you're clobbered from

63
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:01,638
many different angles. It's important to remember that

64
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:04,610
the days where awesome improvements are instrumented,

65
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,280
they're always just around the corner, so never be too hard on yourself.

66
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,180
Number two, don't throw and hope, aim and fire.

67
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,402
So here's a visual representation of throwing and

68
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:19,660
hoping for everyone to understand,

69
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,002
and this is a visual representation of aiming and firing.

70
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:28,894
Homer didn't have quite enough power on the punch, but the

71
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:33,082
accuracy was pretty on point. So in combat sports,

72
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:37,374
this takes shape of fighters sometimes wanting to throw haymakers

73
00:06:37,422 --> 00:06:40,786
and hope that a knockout shot lands to win the fight.

74
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:44,542
However, many fighters are of these belief that precision beats

75
00:06:44,606 --> 00:06:48,930
power and timing beats speed. In SRE,

76
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,510
similar situations certainly occur.

77
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,238
For example, when faced with a slow performing website,

78
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:59,090
you may just increase the infrastructure, memory or cpu

79
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,700
availability to see if that resolves a particular issue.

80
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,902
You could start terminating whatever services are running on a server

81
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:10,426
to free up available memory or cpu resources to

82
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:14,046
see if that helped as well. You might even perform the

83
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:17,582
classic turn it off and on again tactic and hope that

84
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:21,194
fixes an issue. All those actions could be viewed

85
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:25,150
as throwing haymakers rather than properly investigating

86
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,150
and debugging why a system or service is failing,

87
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,980
and then making the necessary changes to fix the underlying issue.

88
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,026
Granted, the haymaker's throne might solve

89
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:40,262
an issue completely or buy you extra debugging time

90
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:43,890
during a particular incident or outage, which is always welcomed.

91
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,910
However, always defaulting to these responses each

92
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,574
time an incident occurs, unfortunately is not a valid

93
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:55,242
long term tactical response. It's far

94
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:58,826
better for you and your SRE team to aim for

95
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:02,350
the root cause or causes as to why an issue

96
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,618
might be occurring and these fire your remediation actions

97
00:08:06,714 --> 00:08:10,670
via monitoring, alerting or codeflicks deployments

98
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,630
number three, don't react respond. No, this isn't

99
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,442
another framework for JavaScript. We're actually talking about our

100
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:22,690
actions and emotions during particular situations.

101
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,834
In combat sports, this principles is these to remind fighters

102
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,422
to keep their emotions in check when something is happening

103
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:34,120
as it can help control the outcome of what happens next.

104
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,930
Uncontrolled a reaction might cost a fighter victory

105
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,586
or expose a flaw that cloud be used against them in the

106
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:46,442
future. A response is always more calculated and

107
00:08:46,496 --> 00:08:49,654
tactical in these long term. In SRE,

108
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:53,466
this is a very important principle when it comes to dealing with incidents

109
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:57,614
or outages. When faced with an unfortunate situation,

110
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:01,694
it's far too easy to think that the whole world is crumbling around you or

111
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:04,842
that the incident itself is completely unresolvable.

112
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:07,694
Some folks might even start to blame their colleagues,

113
00:09:07,822 --> 00:09:11,554
vendors or the software application and logic this

114
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:15,054
is very easy to do and it's very easy to react

115
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:18,822
in this way. However, the consequences of directing this

116
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:21,910
blame is very hard to undo.

117
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,606
A more measured and mature response during an

118
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:29,486
incident or outage has several advantages. It allows

119
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:33,674
your SRE team to focus clearly on these task at hand

120
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:37,930
and not be distracted by the external noise. It also shows

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,626
great leadership and calmness under pressure to those involved with

122
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:45,562
the incident. No one wants to be on the receiving end of a negative

123
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:50,042
reaction to an incident or outage, and a more measured response

124
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:54,290
will always elicit a better outcome than a knee jerk reaction.

125
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,498
We in SRE call this incident reasons and not

126
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:02,562
incident reaction for this specific reason. So remember

127
00:10:02,616 --> 00:10:06,226
to take a moment to breathe, think, plan and

128
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:09,110
then respond accordingly. At the end of the day,

129
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,950
all problems have solutions. Number four,

130
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,998
it only takes one punches to change a fight. This is very important

131
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:20,898
when it comes to combat sports, as a perfectly placed punch that

132
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:24,106
is thrown can cause you to win a fight or

133
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:27,706
a perfectly placed punch that is absorbed can cause you to lose a

134
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:31,194
fight. This gives fighters hope that even if

135
00:10:31,232 --> 00:10:34,462
things are not going these way, one punch can change

136
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:38,074
everything. In SRE, we can take this principles

137
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:41,486
and apply it to many things, but in particular it applies to

138
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:44,786
incident response. Sometimes it might feel like a

139
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:48,638
particular problem or incident cannot be solved or fixed.

140
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,466
However, it's important to keep in mind that sometimes all

141
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:56,498
the team requires is one particular command or corrective action

142
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:59,270
to fix an incident or problem entirely.

143
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,906
These can take shape in the form of a firewall rule,

144
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:07,606
updating an application package, downgrading an application

145
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,146
package, or migrating traffic from one availability zone to

146
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:15,126
another. Sometimes that one particular action helps resolve

147
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:19,226
many different issues. Conversely, it's equally important to

148
00:11:19,248 --> 00:11:23,614
keep good communication amongst the SRE group and teams and

149
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:27,722
not perform any commands or actions without letting the team know and potentially

150
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:30,990
having their authorization and permission to do so as well.

151
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,322
Nobody enjoys cowboy coding and a team member deciding,

152
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:39,026
you know what? I'm going to update this database row or screw it.

153
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:43,070
I'm going to restart this server that can make a bad incident even worse.

154
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,402
I say these things not to stress anyone out or advise

155
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:49,830
folks perform no actions. Rather, you must

156
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,494
be cognizant that those actions that you take can

157
00:11:53,532 --> 00:11:56,434
have very positive or very negative effects.

158
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:00,218
So think carefully and talk to your team before you hit the enter key,

159
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:03,898
especially during an incident. Finally, with number five,

160
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:07,322
it's important to remember that a fight is won or lost based

161
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,886
on preparation. What this means for combat sports

162
00:12:10,918 --> 00:12:14,506
terms is that these true outcome of a fight is determined

163
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:17,982
by how well the fighters prepare. Preparation takes

164
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:21,850
place in the form of training in the gym and when situations

165
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,710
are not prepared for. This is when fights can be lost.

166
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,006
Fail to prepare means prepare to fail.

167
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,218
For SRE, this translates to preparing for as many possible

168
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:36,594
outcomes as is feasible. Sure, you cannot

169
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:39,894
prepare for every outcome, but preparing for as many

170
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:43,910
as you can will have great success should

171
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,766
you encounter any roadblocks. For example,

172
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:51,414
it's important to practice game day exercises for disaster

173
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:54,806
recovery so that when an actual outage occurs,

174
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:58,442
things do not feel so unfamiliar. This can be

175
00:12:58,496 --> 00:13:02,302
hugely beneficial as it gives the SRE team a chance to

176
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:06,330
refine their incident response coordination, be it through roles

177
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,594
and or processes with practice exercises

178
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,814
rather than during an actual outage where services are unavailable

179
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:17,966
for your clients and for your customers. This refinement

180
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,414
is essentially the preparation needed so that if similar incidents

181
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:26,234
happen in the future, the SRE team has some comfort

182
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:30,178
in being able to troubleshoot and resolve the incident faster.

183
00:13:30,354 --> 00:13:33,506
Further, by practicing these game day exercises,

184
00:13:33,618 --> 00:13:37,522
there is much less reliance on winging it or guessing

185
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:40,906
what to do when troubleshooting an issue, whether or

186
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:44,490
not it is actually related to an incident. Practice certainly

187
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,710
makes perfect, and the more an SRE team seeks, the uncomfortable,

188
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,810
the more they will become comfortable.

189
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,034
Similarly, being prepared can also take shape

190
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:58,986
by practicing deployments in lower environments before releasing directly

191
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,570
to production. This can potentially save you from outages

192
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,302
or downtime simply by taking these time to preview

193
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,194
how a service might look and be deployed in a

194
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:13,966
pre prod or staging environment rather than always deploying

195
00:14:13,998 --> 00:14:18,114
directly to production. Yes, there are trade offs for deployment

196
00:14:18,162 --> 00:14:21,926
velocity for teams to consider here, but this can be

197
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:25,266
a helpful approach in establishing confidence in production

198
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:28,898
and deployments as you set an expectation

199
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:32,490
on what you expect to see based on a similar

200
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,850
looking environment. The same can definitely

201
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,226
be said about automated testing in deployment pipelines as

202
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:43,206
well. Now, I said I would talk through combat combat sports principles

203
00:14:43,238 --> 00:14:46,494
SRE. There's actually a bonus one that applies to SRE and in

204
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:50,586
life in general. And that is the infamous Mike Tyson quote.

205
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:53,360
Everyone has a plan until they SRE punched in the face.

206
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,862
This is important to remember as this principle

207
00:14:56,926 --> 00:15:00,494
still rings true for SRE. The best laid plans

208
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:04,638
for launching a service or product can quickly go awry due

209
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,826
to a whole host of reasons. Failing tests,

210
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:11,714
incorrect size scaling groups, even expired SSL

211
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:14,882
certificates can all cause incidents or affect

212
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:17,240
service availability very quickly.

213
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,494
SRE teams need to stay on their toes and stay focused

214
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:24,966
for when they too are metaphorically

215
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,462
punched in the face. In tech, not just in SRE

216
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:33,134
plans often challenges quickly and drastically, so this

217
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:36,880
becomes easier to adapt to over time and with experience,

218
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,290
the threats of seemingly random errors, incidents and outages

219
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,762
that alter the original plan will forever remain.

220
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:48,338
So it's important to stay ready for what the machines decide to

221
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:51,966
throw at us. So, to recap combat sports principles SRE

222
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,914
that apply to SRE number one,

223
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:58,886
sometimes you wear the hammer, sometimes the nail. You need to appreciate the

224
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:02,678
good and the bad within our lives. In SRE number two,

225
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:06,914
don't throw in hope. Aim and fire, especially when troubleshooting

226
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:10,966
and resolving incidents. Number three, don't react.

227
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:15,318
Respond. This is why it's called incident response and not incident

228
00:16:15,414 --> 00:16:19,274
reaction. Number four, it only takes one punch to change

229
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:22,966
a fight. Think of this. Whenever you are troubleshooting or are mid

230
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:26,382
incident, one command can alter the outcomes for better

231
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:29,902
or for worse. And number five, the fighters

232
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,806
is won or lost based on preparation. So always try to stay prepared in

233
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:36,990
your incident response and troubleshooting so that you're not having to

234
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,926
wing it as often. And of course, try to remember that all

235
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:44,094
the greatest laid plans can go awry once things start

236
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:47,430
to go badly. Keep your head up, stay in the fight,

237
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,840
and as these referee says, protect yourself at all times.

238
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,790
With that, I want to thank you for tuning in and listening to this talk

239
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,898
on combat sports principles Sre apply to site reliability engineering.

240
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:02,886
A big thanks to 42 for providing this opportunity and I

241
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:05,800
look forward to hearing from everyone in the future. Thanks.
