1
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,566
Okay, starting the SLO's implementations. So I

2
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:38,646
will start from the problems, guys. So these kind

3
00:00:38,668 --> 00:00:41,750
of problems that I've been stated on my slide,

4
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,080
I've been filtered and I think these three problems,

5
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,214
it's a common problems for a tech company. I guess the first thing

6
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,782
first, it's third party or your business partner said that

7
00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:58,430
their services that you use will downtime for a while.

8
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,538
This is a problem because we don't know what is

9
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:06,162
for a while definition. It is 1 minute, is it

10
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:09,460
2 minutes or I mean is it two years?

11
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,506
Because we didn't have any standardized for

12
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:16,934
our services that could be allowed to

13
00:01:16,972 --> 00:01:21,014
retrieve an error from the third party. So this

14
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:24,710
kind of problem, this is the foundation problem

15
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,074
why you should implementing the slos. And the second one is your

16
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:31,546
product team had a debate if the new deployed surface was stable or

17
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:35,546
not. Because I think it

18
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:39,082
is very different about how product team

19
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:42,862
works and the operations team works. Right. Because product team

20
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,870
should be very agile, very dynamic,

21
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,422
it should be tolerable with the change.

22
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:53,698
Because in order to improve the product itself,

23
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:57,310
it should be changed. Right. But in the other hand, the operations

24
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,020
team was very,

25
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,706
it should be stable. It should be stable and it's

26
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:09,922
kind of like how to operate the software

27
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:13,654
more safely. So this is also a problem because product

28
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:17,590
team wants to pass very oftenly the chains

29
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,542
or the new products or the new services, but the operations

30
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:25,450
team wants to keep stable,

31
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,246
keep doing everything on

32
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:33,674
the settlement state. So it's

33
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:37,118
kind of problem also. And the second one

34
00:02:37,204 --> 00:02:41,166
is also the foundations why you should implementing the slos. And the

35
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:45,070
third one is there is a confusions on down definitions

36
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,274
between your operations team and product or engineering team.

37
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:51,842
Yeah, like I said before, because the product

38
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:55,282
or engineering team wants to be deployed fast, very fast,

39
00:02:55,336 --> 00:02:59,026
very often and very dynamically. But your operations teams

40
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:02,210
in the other hand wants to be very safely, very carefully,

41
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,714
very stable to operate the software

42
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:09,386
itself, to keep maintaining the reliability of

43
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:13,062
the software itself. So SLO

44
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,790
is coming to help you. So what is the SLO?

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,586
SLO is a target value or range of values for

46
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:24,186
a surface level that is measured by an SLI.

47
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:27,582
By the way, I'm quoting these definitions from the book called

48
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:32,062
site reliability Engineering. The book was from Google and

49
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:36,014
I think it was a great book to start your journey, your site reliability

50
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:39,634
engineering journey. So you should read it. So from

51
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:42,914
these definitions we found a buzzword again, it is

52
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:47,014
the SLI. So we

53
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:50,982
cannot understand SLO completely before we

54
00:03:51,116 --> 00:03:54,294
should learn about the SLI first. So you should

55
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:58,226
start with the SLI. What is the SLI. SLI is a carefully defined

56
00:03:58,258 --> 00:04:02,662
quantitative measure of some aspect of the level of service that is provided.

57
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:06,154
It is a lot of buzzword, but on my word is the metrics that

58
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:10,282
you want to observe. I mean, the metrics can be everything, right? Like your

59
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:13,706
surface latency, your non error response

60
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:17,658
of your services, and then your saturations

61
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:21,098
of your instances or the surfers.

62
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,106
So the metrics can be everything. But on

63
00:04:25,128 --> 00:04:28,354
the specific SLI, it is the metrics that you want

64
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,586
to observe. So I will explain to

65
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:35,366
you what is the characteristics of the SLI on

66
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:38,438
the next slide, after, you know,

67
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:42,502
what is the definitions of SLI, going back to

68
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:46,338
the SLO definitions. So on my word, the SLO

69
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:49,894
definition is the target value or range of values

70
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,970
from your metrics that you want to observe.

71
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,580
For example, your SLi could be your

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,414
latency of your services, let's say. So if

73
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:06,078
you see your moving average of your latency, let's say

74
00:05:06,164 --> 00:05:10,266
your latency, it's average below 200 millisecond,

75
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:14,414
let's say that is your Sli, but your SLO

76
00:05:14,462 --> 00:05:18,034
should be a target from your SlI itself. So my

77
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:21,362
target average of latency should be

78
00:05:21,416 --> 00:05:24,274
below 100 millisecond, let's say.

79
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:28,594
Okay, so then by default, you are breaching your SLO,

80
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:32,886
right? But we will not talk about this now.

81
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:36,534
But you could differentiate it, right?

82
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:40,086
So the SlI, it's the metrics that you want to observe,

83
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:43,660
but the SLO, it's the target of your,

84
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,230
okay, the target of your SLi that should be achieved

85
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,074
from your SlI. That is the definitions of

86
00:05:52,112 --> 00:05:55,350
SLO. Okay,

87
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,878
but I think I know what you're thinking

88
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:02,430
now to start implementing the SLO,

89
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,558
you will feel like. But I don't know what metrics should I observe

90
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:10,450
for now. So there is a lot of metrics that you can

91
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,810
achieve from your entire system, I guess.

92
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,586
So there is a ton of

93
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:21,334
metrics that you can retract from

94
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:25,042
your services or your products or your infrastructure,

95
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:28,780
I guess. But the thing is, if you sre on the

96
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,674
Google SRE workbook. So if you have

97
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:37,146
no idea about what metrics should I retrieve? So you

98
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:41,722
can follow these four golden signals. You can start

99
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,982
to collect the data about your latency,

100
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:48,234
services or latency of your systems,

101
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:52,014
I guess. Or the second one, you can start

102
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:55,498
to collect and retrieve your traffic metrics.

103
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:59,258
And the third one, it's the errors metrics.

104
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:02,766
So I have been stated also on my slide,

105
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:06,582
what is the error means? So the rate of requests that fail either

106
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:09,942
explicitly, it's like the HTTP five,

107
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,814
xx, or implicitly, for example, an HTTP 200

108
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:17,794
success response. But coupled with the wrong content or

109
00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:22,406
on some other applications, every error or unexpected results

110
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:26,038
about it is categorized through an error.

111
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:29,542
So that is the definitions of errors.

112
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:34,094
You can start collecting the errors metric also from your services

113
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:37,726
or your products or your infrastructure, I guess.

114
00:07:37,908 --> 00:07:40,938
And the fourth one is the saturations.

115
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:44,514
And the definition on the saturation is how

116
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:48,306
full your surfaces is. So I've been note also what is

117
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:52,900
the definitions of saturation. So going back through your

118
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,466
worried, so I know you kind

119
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:02,802
of confuse what is the metric should I observe

120
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:07,494
if I have no idea about the metric itself? So you can follow the

121
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:10,810
forbulden signals. It's also stated on the Google

122
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,002
SRE workbook. So these four metrics at least you should

123
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:18,246
retrieve from your services or your infrastructure.

124
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:22,110
Okay, so you can start to collecting, or if you

125
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,126
have no

126
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,834
surface to collect the metrics, you can start to deploy the surface

127
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:34,366
itself like Prometheus or surface

128
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:38,578
mesh. You can also using the surface mesh if

129
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:42,386
you have kubernetes cluster right to retrieve these kind

130
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:46,462
of metrics. A lot of procedures

131
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,846
to retrieve these metrics. But the thing is,

132
00:08:49,948 --> 00:08:53,190
if you have no idea about what metrics should I retrieve,

133
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,950
these forbidden signals can help you to define

134
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,930
what metrics should be in your SLi.

135
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,882
Okay, now I know what should be measured and then

136
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:11,678
what? And the next step is

137
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:15,262
start to create your SLI after

138
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:18,960
you know, what metrics should you

139
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,450
build the SLI, what metrics should you observe

140
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,950
and then start to create the SLI. There is two steps

141
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,986
on how to build the SLI. First, you should

142
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:38,262
build the SLI specifications. So the

143
00:09:38,316 --> 00:09:43,654
SLI specifications contains the definitions about what

144
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:47,602
you want to observe. You can detail it

145
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:50,140
like my previous example.

146
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,210
So it's like, okay, so my SLI specification,

147
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,122
I want to measure the average latency within

148
00:10:00,176 --> 00:10:04,078
a month from my surface a, let's say.

149
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:07,566
So that is the definitions. It is one

150
00:10:07,588 --> 00:10:11,214
of these SLI specifications. And the second one on the

151
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:15,310
SLI specification is usually it's a form of percentile

152
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:21,246
or percentage between some events and total events. So it's

153
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,866
like the portions of the target of the

154
00:10:24,888 --> 00:10:28,802
events that you want, that you want to be observed divided by every

155
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:31,960
events that has been occurred. Okay,

156
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,174
so let's say you want to measure your

157
00:10:37,212 --> 00:10:41,242
average latency below 200 milliseconds within

158
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:45,340
a month. So your SLI should be

159
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,626
some of the requests that had a

160
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:53,598
latency below 200 milliseconds divided by total

161
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:56,906
request. So the SLI should be percentile

162
00:10:56,938 --> 00:11:00,080
or percentage. You can imagine that.

163
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,950
And after you build your SLI specifications,

164
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:08,030
you can going through the second step, it is this SLI implementations.

165
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,354
So you know what your SLI definition is.

166
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:16,114
But now you should thinking again where

167
00:11:16,152 --> 00:11:19,746
you can get the metrics. How can you get the metrics?

168
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:23,554
Also, if you're using the Prometheus, you should use ProMQl,

169
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:27,400
right? And you should learn on how to querying it and

170
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,134
how to aggregate it to

171
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:35,626
fulfill your SLI specifications. But the thing is,

172
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:39,082
the generic formula to create the SLI implementation is

173
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:42,894
a good or target events divided by total events times

174
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:46,734
100%. Like I said before, usually it's a

175
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:51,374
kind of percentile or percentage. So once

176
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:54,750
again SLI is a good events divided by total events

177
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,434
times 100% like my

178
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:02,146
previous example. So sum of all

179
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:05,654
the requests that had latency below 200

180
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,754
milliseconds divided by total request

181
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:12,022
times 100%. Okay,

182
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:15,542
that is my SLI specifications example. You can

183
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:19,258
build it from now another

184
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:23,542
SLI examples. So on my SLI specifications

185
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:27,286
I stated that I want to measure HTTP response,

186
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:30,666
that return non error response. I define

187
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:34,202
also what is the non error response. It is the two xx

188
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:36,990
or three xx to the client response.

189
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,278
And on my implementations I will retrieve my

190
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:44,690
HTTP response counting.

191
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,866
I will count the total of the

192
00:12:48,888 --> 00:12:52,274
HTTP response that fulfill my SLR specifications and also

193
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:55,410
the total request response to the client.

194
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,574
I can query it from the API gateway metrics, or I can

195
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,062
query from the surface mesh, or I can

196
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,966
querying it from the it's like

197
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,246
the cloud player or

198
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:14,520
some other cloud proxy services. It's also providing the

199
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,058
counting of HTTP response. So my SLI

200
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:23,786
should be a sum of two xx response

201
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:27,486
plus sum of three xx response divided by all

202
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:30,862
the torque requests within a time window within

203
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:34,514
some particular time times 100%.

204
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:38,258
So I can retrieve the percentage of

205
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:41,682
my target events. Okay, so that is

206
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:44,994
my SLI. So this is the example. So you can start

207
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:49,234
to first thing first you should find your metrics

208
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:53,010
and then build these SLI specifications. And then try to build the SLI

209
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,770
implementing, okay, and then after you had an SLI,

210
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,782
you should choose your time window.

211
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:03,626
The first time window you should choose, it's the evaluations or

212
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:07,466
aggregations time window. So you could imagine that if

213
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:11,306
you had a web server, that it's a normal web server that's serving

214
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:15,482
the HTTP request. You could imagine that your client

215
00:14:15,546 --> 00:14:19,310
request doesn't have the constant

216
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,630
time rate, right? It doesn't constantly

217
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,018
request every 1 second, and then sometimes

218
00:14:28,184 --> 00:14:32,254
it is every 1 second. Sometimes it is per one millisecond

219
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:35,714
request, I think. So there is no constant

220
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:38,946
time for the client request. So client

221
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:41,542
can request every time,

222
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:42,200
right.

223
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,438
But in the SLI, you should choose your aggregations time,

224
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:52,198
what time you want to evaluate it. Is it per 1 minute

225
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:56,074
request or is it per five minute request? Or is

226
00:14:56,112 --> 00:15:00,166
it every ten minute request? So you should choose your aggregations

227
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,742
of your metrics time window. Okay. And the second one

228
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:07,198
is you should choose your Slo time window. So you

229
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:11,486
could imagine that if you had a web server that

230
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:14,420
had been running through ten years,

231
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,420
you want to measure the SLo for

232
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,546
going back to ten years, right? It didn't make sense. Right? So you

233
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:28,198
should choose your Slo time. Is it per week, is it per

234
00:15:28,284 --> 00:15:31,078
one month? Or is it per one years?

235
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,742
So you should choose your Slo time window when

236
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:38,620
you want to evaluate your target. Is it rich or not?

237
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,206
Is it breach or not? You should define

238
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:47,162
also the slo time window. So after

239
00:15:47,216 --> 00:15:50,730
you choose your time window and you had an SLI,

240
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,190
then you should set the boundaries.

241
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,682
These are the steps to set your SlO boundaries.

242
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:02,158
Okay, first thing first, try to visualize it.

243
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:05,726
Try to retrieve the metrics, your SlI metrics,

244
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:09,554
and then visualize it within your

245
00:16:09,592 --> 00:16:12,660
selected time window as well.

246
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,282
So after you visualize it, you should find the average movement

247
00:16:17,346 --> 00:16:21,350
of your SLI. Okay? So I think the movement of average,

248
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,054
it's between 90%

249
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,626
until 95%, I guess. So that is

250
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:33,354
your average movement. So I will show to you the

251
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,162
example on the next SLI, but bear with me. So these

252
00:16:37,216 --> 00:16:41,194
are the steps to set your first boundaries

253
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:43,710
of your SlO from your Sli.

254
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,018
And third one put the boundaries below the minimum point or average

255
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:52,670
movement. Okay? So there is

256
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,114
another point that you should pay attention. Slo. The first

257
00:16:56,152 --> 00:17:00,270
thing first is if you put the boundaries on top of your average movement,

258
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,534
then by default your system was breaching the SLO.

259
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:07,430
Okay? So that should be noted

260
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,222
by you, because if your

261
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:14,546
average movement of your metrics or of your SLI,

262
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:18,906
I would say it's between 90%

263
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:23,194
until 95% success. But you

264
00:17:23,232 --> 00:17:26,774
set your boundaries SLO first. Boundaries SLO,

265
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:30,890
it's on 99%. So by default,

266
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,782
your system couldn't achieve, right. It means that your

267
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:38,298
SLi, it's breaching your slo

268
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:41,966
by the first time. Okay? So it is not good. So you

269
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:45,490
should find the average movement of your SlI.

270
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,378
It's more easier to visualize it first as well.

271
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:55,286
But after it, you should find the average movement of

272
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,382
your SLI and put the boundaries below

273
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:03,222
the average movement of your SLI. And the second

274
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:07,126
point is it usually start from 90% the

275
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:10,826
boundaries or your first SLO, your first target on

276
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:14,700
your SLI, it usually start from 90% but

277
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,370
it is not allowed.

278
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,566
But usually it standardized start from

279
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:28,046
the 90% and then after 90%

280
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:31,662
you can improve your SLI metrics by tuning your

281
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:35,406
surfaces I guess. And after

282
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:39,358
your SLI is increasing, the average movement of your SLI

283
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:43,234
is increasing. You can start to incrementing it

284
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:47,558
to 95%, but you can do whatever your number is.

285
00:18:47,724 --> 00:18:51,526
But it is the general one. And the

286
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:55,522
third one is you can increase your SLO after your normal circumstances

287
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:58,922
is also going up. Okay, again, so if you

288
00:18:58,976 --> 00:19:03,034
put your boundaries first on

289
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:06,570
top of your moving average, then I believe your

290
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,070
SLI should be breaching your

291
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,350
slo or your boundaries.

292
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,494
But let me check on the example part for

293
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,350
more better understanding. Let's see the examples.

294
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,078
So I have the SLI specifications,

295
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:29,794
which is HTTP that return non error response for every 5

296
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:34,318
minutes. So I will break down my Sli

297
00:19:34,414 --> 00:19:38,626
implementations, I mean my SLi specifications,

298
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:42,690
Slo five minute matrix aggregation times, which is one dot matrix

299
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,822
on the graph and then 30

300
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:51,174
days of my slo time. So that is my chosen

301
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:54,922
time window. And then going

302
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,218
back to set boundaries step.

303
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:02,160
So we should visualize it so we can see the graph itself.

304
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,158
And if we see the average movement of

305
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:09,934
my metrics, it's sometimes it 100%

306
00:20:09,972 --> 00:20:13,282
per every 5 minutes and

307
00:20:13,336 --> 00:20:16,722
sometimes it's below 85% and

308
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:20,034
even it is reached to

309
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:24,370
the 75%. Okay, so if we see the average movement,

310
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,270
I can set it from the 95%, but you can

311
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,026
do the calculate of the median of your metrics

312
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:37,914
for it. For the better of set

313
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:40,986
the first boundaries, you can set them on the median of it.

314
00:20:41,088 --> 00:20:44,490
But for this simple

315
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,106
guessing, so you can see the average movement of

316
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:51,902
your graph. Okay, so I will set

317
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:55,390
my first set boundaries or my slo

318
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,098
to the 95% of Slo.

319
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:02,946
So for better understanding this graph. So I

320
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:06,882
will explain to you that every dot on

321
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:10,434
this graph, every single matrix dot on

322
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:14,510
this graph is implementing the 5 minutes metrics of aggregations

323
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,014
of the request of the HTTP

324
00:21:18,062 --> 00:21:22,034
non error response divided by total request in average

325
00:21:22,162 --> 00:21:25,362
on every 5 minutes. That is the one dot on this graph.

326
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:29,000
Okay, that should be noted by you.

327
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,074
So how did we know that our surface or our

328
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:38,218
SLI in this case breached the SLO? So if

329
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:41,662
the sum of matrix below Slo is

330
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:45,434
greater than one minus Slo times slo time window

331
00:21:45,482 --> 00:21:49,022
divided by aggregation time window, so then

332
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:52,714
we breach the Slo. Okay, so for better understanding

333
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:56,690
SLO, we back to best on our example, we have 5 minutes

334
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,954
matrix aggregation time. Remember, there is one

335
00:21:59,992 --> 00:22:03,346
dot matrix on the graph and we had the

336
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:06,646
30 days SLO time and we

337
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:10,230
had the 95% of SLO.

338
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,110
So we have an allowed error response within

339
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,626
one -95% time 30 days.

340
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:23,100
Okay, what do we mean by this?

341
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,100
Because our target SLO, it's just

342
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,746
not achieved the non

343
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:37,198
error response below the 95%.

344
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:42,238
Okay, so we allowed the error happens just

345
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:45,140
5% between 30 days.

346
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,114
You can imagine that, right? Slo once again,

347
00:22:50,232 --> 00:22:54,686
because our target is returning

348
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:58,918
to the client with non error response with

349
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:02,360
95% within the 30 days.

350
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,246
So we allowed the error, we allowed the

351
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:09,994
error one -95% which is 5%

352
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:14,106
in the 30 days. Okay, so we

353
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:17,898
tolerate the errors within 5%

354
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:20,880
between 30 days, which is 36 hours.

355
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,578
And because we have a 5 minutes aggregations matrix,

356
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:29,406
then we have 36 hours

357
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,138
divided by 5 minutes of allowed under

358
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:37,954
95% matrix one dots which

359
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:40,500
is 432.

360
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:47,254
You got it right. So if your

361
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:51,666
five minute matrix. So if one dot matrix on this graph,

362
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:53,910
if one dot on this graph,

363
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:00,262
on this visualized graph and

364
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:03,738
below the 95% below

365
00:24:03,824 --> 00:24:07,286
our target and tends to appear greater

366
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:11,502
than 432 times within 30

367
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:14,926
days. So if we manually calculate this

368
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:20,302
1234-5678

369
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:24,426
910 if we calculating it manually, right, it's this

370
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:27,842
estimate. So if we calculating it and

371
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:32,882
sum all of the dots that below our

372
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:36,594
SLO and it tends to appear

373
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,502
greater than 432 times within 30

374
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:44,338
days, then you breach your 30 days slo.

375
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:47,880
Okay, it should be makes sense to you, right?

376
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:52,086
But this problem can be understood better when we introduce the error

377
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:55,974
budget concept. So the error budget is actually one minus

378
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:59,462
slO, but it has greater capability to detect

379
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:03,102
the SLO breach within

380
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:06,990
the concept of error budget and error rate.

381
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,086
But I will explain it later. So to quick recap on how

382
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:14,514
to build your first SLO, the first thing

383
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:17,490
first, you should build your SLI specifications.

384
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,986
If you're still not sure about what to be measured, see the

385
00:25:22,008 --> 00:25:25,054
four golden signals. After you had

386
00:25:25,112 --> 00:25:28,594
SLI specifications, you should going to build your SLI

387
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:33,366
implementations as well. So you

388
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:37,454
should start to think about where and how you can get those metrics

389
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:40,966
right. And how can I formulate

390
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:46,026
those metrics. So my implementations should

391
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:48,570
be matched with my SLI specifications.

392
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,074
After you had SLI implementations,

393
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:55,434
you should visualize your metrics,

394
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:58,654
your SLI within. Also the

395
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:02,954
next step, set the time window, set your metrics aggregations

396
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:06,462
time window what the

397
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:10,226
timing node that you want to

398
00:26:10,248 --> 00:26:13,682
observe. And you also should choose your

399
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:17,846
SLO time window when you will evaluate that the

400
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,560
SLO is breached or not.

401
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,182
And after that, you should see the average movement of your

402
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:28,278
SLI. After you visualize it,

403
00:26:28,444 --> 00:26:31,914
you can see the average movement of your SLI. And the next step

404
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:35,366
is set the boundaries below the average movement of your SLI.

405
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:38,666
So I have given you a

406
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:42,234
reason why it should be below the average movement of your SLI,

407
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:46,094
right? So it's actually your

408
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:49,690
boundaries. It's actually your first SLO. Congratulations.

409
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,362
You have the SLO. Now then, if we're going back through

410
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:57,426
our problems, it should be the

411
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:00,194
solutions after we implementing the SLO, right?

412
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:04,162
Like the first case, the third party or your business partner said

413
00:27:04,216 --> 00:27:07,622
that their service will downtime for a while. So it

414
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:11,094
shouldn't be for a while. Okay. Because you know you had

415
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:16,310
an SLO that you cannot return

416
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,706
can error more than x minutes.

417
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,226
So you should talk to your partner that we had an

418
00:27:23,248 --> 00:27:27,174
SLO. So you cannot go into the maintenance

419
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:30,330
time or downtime more than 5 minutes, let's say. Okay.

420
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,100
And the second problem is,

421
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,934
it is okay for an error. Okay. It is okay for can

422
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:41,358
error. We tolerate can error as long as the slimetric still on

423
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:45,026
top of the slo. The third problem,

424
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:50,162
it's also okay for returning the unexpected result when

425
00:27:50,216 --> 00:27:53,650
product or engineering team, it's told

426
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,634
that their service was returning an error

427
00:27:57,682 --> 00:28:00,802
or unexpected result intermittent.

428
00:28:00,866 --> 00:28:04,374
So operations team can say that it is okay

429
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:07,798
for returning unexpected result as long as the SLI is still on

430
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:11,270
top of the SLO. SLO. The operations

431
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,934
team, the product team, the engineering team had the same definitions

432
00:28:14,982 --> 00:28:18,074
on what is the down definitions? As long

433
00:28:18,112 --> 00:28:21,500
as it's not breaching our SLO, it's okay.

434
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,940
It's also same with the second case.

435
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,342
So whenever product team wants to

436
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:33,582
deploy it, very vast, deployed, very agile and operations

437
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:37,186
teams, it's too scared to

438
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:41,362
being very agile. So product

439
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:44,562
team and operations team can have a bergaine about

440
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:49,234
the okay. So we had our

441
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:52,662
SLI. Still about the SLO. Let's doing

442
00:28:52,716 --> 00:28:55,926
some experiment stuff. Because it is okay for

443
00:28:55,948 --> 00:29:00,154
error as long as the SLI metrics stay on top of the slO. So for

444
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:03,846
next topics, I will talk about error budgets

445
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:07,514
and error policy. And these concepts will help

446
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:11,466
you understand better on when the

447
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,680
SLO is breached or not.

448
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,330
And next, I will talk about how to calculate the SLO for integrated services.

449
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,502
Let's say surface a had an SLO and then

450
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:25,438
had the communications with the surface b also had an SLO.

451
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:29,506
How can we calculating the SLo between all

452
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:33,234
of those services that was integrated? And next

453
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:36,482
I will talk about the alerting on slos. And the last one

454
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:40,166
it's the interesting part. Why can rerelease can improve your slos while

455
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:44,280
maintaining agility? By the way, on the number one, number two and number three,

456
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,786
I had written on my article. So visit

457
00:29:48,818 --> 00:29:51,926
my medium and follow so you can

458
00:29:51,948 --> 00:29:55,222
read it. And the fourth one, I still progressing my

459
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:59,774
article and doing some math on it and

460
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,900
think that's all for me. Thanks. See you.
