00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,862
Hi, this is Gordon Rudd coming to you from Python 2021,

2
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,360
brought to you by conference 42.

3
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,486
Today I'm going to be speaking to you on a subject that's really near and

4
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:40,946
dear to my heart, creating scalable and sustainable cybersecurity

5
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:44,434
for any size organization. I'm very excited

6
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:48,166
to be these today, simply because many years ago, I started my technology

7
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,614
career as a programmer, you using a programming language that

8
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:55,150
most of you have probably only read about in history books called Fortran.

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,566
Today we're going to be speaking at a conference with one

10
00:00:59,588 --> 00:01:03,626
of the premier languages on the planet, especially a premier

11
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:07,182
language in the cybersecurity field. I'm sure you're aware

12
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:10,994
that every computer on the planet has the ability to

13
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:15,010
create log files and literally record everything that's going on on the machine.

14
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,046
Sounds, areas, but it creates a

15
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:22,710
river of data, and these river of data flows into a data

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,802
lake that creates a data ocean. And cybersecurity

17
00:01:26,866 --> 00:01:30,706
professionals such as myself, we're only interested in really one thing. We're trying to find

18
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:34,374
where the bad things might happen. Well, you can imagine

19
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:38,202
when we look at a river or we look at an ocean, we're really

20
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:41,502
only seeking one drop of water. And it's very difficult

21
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,954
to find that drop of water without a tool that's going to help you isolate

22
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:48,750
these exact drop and then figure

23
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,366
out exactly what that means. Python is

24
00:01:52,388 --> 00:01:56,142
one of these tools that helps us to create safer

25
00:01:56,206 --> 00:02:00,430
systems, systems that we can secure and to find the bad actors,

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,206
and we find it everywhere. If you're a penetration tester,

27
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:07,394
or pin tester, as we call it, Python's your tool.

28
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:10,806
You're going to be using many different tools, but when

29
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:14,694
you're going to create something, it's probably going to be in Python. For today,

30
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:18,146
we've got a really short agenda, but it's really packed

31
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:21,798
with content. We're going to try and define these relationship between scalability,

32
00:02:21,894 --> 00:02:25,082
sustainability, and the flexibility that's required in any

33
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:28,986
cybersecurity programmer department. And we're going to try and show you

34
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:33,498
how that scalability and flexibility relates to your Python programming

35
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:36,926
every single day for your organization. And we want

36
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,926
to walk you through how an organization should

37
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,814
assess their cybersecurity program and assess

38
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:48,578
its operational readiness. Successfully communicating with your

39
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:52,354
governance risk committee teams, your C suite and your board also

40
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:55,586
a critical function of cybersecurity. Identifying and

41
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,410
focusing on the top five areas where cisos need to be successful,

42
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,614
is one of the last things we want to do. And I want to make

43
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:06,102
sure that as we're going through this that you all

44
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:09,862
get a sense of what it takes to be a success at that sea level.

45
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,226
So you may want to be in the sea level one day, or you may

46
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:16,650
just work for people that are in the sea level and you want to understand

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,702
them a little better from a security perspective.

48
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:23,230
We've been doing this for 1000 years.

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,894
We've been building castles to protect ourselves and protect our

50
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:30,350
tribes for a thousand years. And we haven't changed the way we do it today.

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,014
Cybersecurity today works very much like this. We've got inner

52
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:38,270
walls, the watchtower guard checks, limited entry.

53
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,226
We've got a demilitarized zone, or a DMZ, as we refer to

54
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:45,942
it. We all use this castle doctrine, which is what we refer

55
00:03:45,996 --> 00:03:49,618
to this model as to create scalable cybersecurity

56
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:53,298
for every organization. That's the model that every organization uses.

57
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:57,314
But scalability is directly equatable

58
00:03:57,442 --> 00:04:00,538
to economic flexibility. I had several of

59
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:04,042
my friends call when Covid hit a year or so ago and say,

60
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:08,134
oh, my God, the C suite has gone crazy. They're sending

61
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:11,978
out laptops from XYZ company that

62
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:15,406
haven't been vetted, we haven't been able to touch them. We're doing all

63
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:18,846
these crazy things. What should we do? How should we handle this?

64
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:21,838
And my counsel back to them was very simple.

65
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:25,850
The C suite and the board are doing everything they can to keep the organization

66
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,518
afloat. They're doing everything they can to make sure that those checks

67
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:33,074
that come to your bank account automatically every other week keep coming.

68
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:36,706
So perhaps you should help them do what they're doing right now to

69
00:04:36,728 --> 00:04:40,086
keep the company alive and we can recover on the back end

70
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:44,230
and see if we can't plug any holes that we've created for ourselves.

71
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,214
That's the kind of attitude I think we all in technology need

72
00:04:48,252 --> 00:04:52,278
to have, is how can we keep the organization going, yet accomplish our objective

73
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:56,230
in cybersecurity? We have all these layers that we work with constantly,

74
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,830
and at the same time, we've got to maintain that CIA

75
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,774
triad. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.

76
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:07,418
Those things areas never going to change. They're constants in our organization.

77
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:11,226
So when I go in to consult with an organization,

78
00:05:11,418 --> 00:05:15,630
one of the first things that I ask is, what is your cybersecurity readiness?

79
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,362
And they'll say, well, what do you mean? And my next question is always,

80
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:23,198
would you have a sock or no sock? Well, if you don't

81
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:26,742
have a security operations center, you probably

82
00:05:26,796 --> 00:05:30,754
don't have the kind of cybersecurity readiness that it's going to take in today's

83
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:34,402
world, we're having pipelines shut down. We have the ability

84
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:37,910
to shut down nuclear reactors, any power

85
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,990
generation station. We can shut down radio and tv stations.

86
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,366
Hackers can just about do any darn

87
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:48,794
thing they want to do today. Well, it's up to us not only to build

88
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:53,386
the castle, but to watch what they're doing. If we don't have a SoC structure,

89
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:57,054
if we don't have a formal place to center all

90
00:05:57,092 --> 00:06:00,878
the information and all the analysis, we're really running

91
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:04,594
behind the power curve. So as we're building our

92
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,902
castle, as we're building our castle doctrine

93
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,738
security system that we all use,

94
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:14,338
the first milestone that I always ask everybody for is your security

95
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:17,398
education, training and awareness program. Do you have one?

96
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:21,922
Cybersecurity today, simply put, is a team sport.

97
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:26,086
And everybody in your organization, every single person in

98
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:29,194
your organization, is part of that team.

99
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:33,590
So from a programmer's perspective, you're part of that cybersecurity

100
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,858
team. Also, you should be thinking about security

101
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:40,682
education, training and awareness. And your cybersecurity team

102
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:44,766
should be helping you out with that. They should also be looking to you for

103
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:48,554
help in how to create secure code, how to do code walkthroughs,

104
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:52,174
how to do structured code walkthroughs, things that are going to help the

105
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:56,478
code that comes out of your programming department to be more secure

106
00:06:56,574 --> 00:07:00,146
and to make sure that we're trapping the right errors. And that that security

107
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:04,050
that's baked into our applications as we develop them

108
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,378
is also part of the overall security fabric of

109
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:10,726
the organization. Because the other thing that you have

110
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:14,486
to do as a CISo, when you come in, you're going to identify your

111
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:18,434
stakeholders, and you're going to have to understand your numbers. Your stakeholders

112
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:22,406
don't just include the board of directors and everybody that's in the C suite.

113
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:26,534
They also include every line of business owner, every line of business manager,

114
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:30,438
director, whatever you want to call them. Any department head

115
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:34,510
is one of your stakeholders. You've got to understand these

116
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,154
needs. Now, as a programmer or business analyst that's creating

117
00:07:38,202 --> 00:07:42,250
programs, you're going to have a very unique perspective

118
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,554
on at least one department, maybe two or three. You're going to

119
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,990
understand the handoffs between departments and between programs.

120
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,642
You're going to have to help your cybersecurity team make sure that

121
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:56,402
they know where those touch points are and that they're doing

122
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:59,826
everything these can to make sure that those touch points are secure.

123
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:04,166
You also have to understand your numbers. A small to medium sized organization today,

124
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,686
let's say it's a three to $5 billion bank in

125
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:11,050
the finance industry. They're going to see at least 500 million

126
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,698
bad actors pass their firewall every year. That's a ton

127
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:17,850
of bad actors. Now, as Covid ramped up,

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,898
that number jumped up to about 750,000 attempts

129
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:25,774
to ping, map, see into those

130
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:29,198
networks. Not a good place to be. And then you have

131
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:32,986
to understand your governance, risk compliance, and those five ps

132
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:36,586
GRC's, five p's are programs. You've got a program for vendor

133
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:40,258
management, cybersecurity, and on and on, and that sort of thing.

134
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:44,210
Every program has projects, processes, procedures, and people.

135
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,082
And those are really the five P's you're looking at. Program processes,

136
00:08:48,146 --> 00:08:52,214
procedures, projects, and people. That is the key element to

137
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:55,734
milestone four. Who are those folks? Are they part

138
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:59,554
of the security team? How do you fit into that as a Python programmer,

139
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:02,938
as a security expert? And then you're going to look at your overall security

140
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:06,906
architecture to make sure that that security architecture is exactly where

141
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:10,554
you want it to be and is operating efficiently and in a manner that

142
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,742
makes sense for your organization. And there's no one size fits all.

143
00:09:13,796 --> 00:09:17,354
Every organization is different. The other things we've got to do, and Python

144
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:21,502
is kind of mission critical in this area. We've got to identify every

145
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:25,026
asset that's on our network. That means when

146
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:28,622
you look at these network, if you just think of it as a wired infrastructure,

147
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:32,910
everything that's attached to that network, we must identify printers,

148
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,518
fax machines, laptops,

149
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:39,318
desktops, the heating and air systems. Anything that's attached to

150
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:42,514
that network, we need to know about it. It's part of a triangle

151
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:46,550
we're going to talk about later, of looking for threats and

152
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,198
finding those threats, identifying your vulnerabilities and then patching

153
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:54,438
these accordingly. Your business continuity and disaster recovery plans

154
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:58,618
are mission critical. And again, as you're developing those,

155
00:09:58,784 --> 00:10:02,366
you can see exactly what the roles are going to be for

156
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:06,026
the different departments. So you want to make sure that as you're developing

157
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:10,458
your business continuity and disaster recovery, that you're including programming,

158
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:14,154
because I promise you, when a disaster

159
00:10:14,202 --> 00:10:17,346
occurs, they're going to be places where we're going to want to

160
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:20,194
make some temporary patches and do some temporary things.

161
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,710
Python is an excellent way of doing that. And, of course, risk management.

162
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,678
Everything we do is based on risk. We're looking to identify the risk.

163
00:10:27,774 --> 00:10:31,334
We want to make sure that we've got the inherent risk, the risk that comes

164
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:35,362
in with whatever the asset is or whatever the company is identified.

165
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,486
And we want to make sure that we know what mitigation we're going to be

166
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:41,478
able to put in place to reduce that risk.

167
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,854
And then we want to know for sure, for dead

168
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:48,282
certain, what our residual risk is and also

169
00:10:48,336 --> 00:10:51,754
training and cross training. A lot of organizations see these as

170
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:55,218
kind of a waste of time, but I'm going to take a little different opinion

171
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,634
of that. Even if you're a programmer, you need to have an understanding

172
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:01,902
of upstream and downstream. So you may want to know what DNS is.

173
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:05,454
You may want to know exactly what the stack that you're working

174
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:09,394
within is. You may not be a full stack developer, but you should understand the

175
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:13,106
stack. And that means you've got to know a lot about networking and a lot

176
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:16,446
about how everything's put together within your organization

177
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:20,066
and its unique footprint so that you can create programs

178
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:23,414
that are safe and securing. We're all looking for the same

179
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:27,702
type of place to start, and we always start with these data. That's always

180
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:31,142
the right place to start. We're always going to have an app that's going to

181
00:11:31,196 --> 00:11:34,314
be around the data, that's going to help us read and write the data.

182
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:37,654
That app is going to be on a host system of some kind. That host

183
00:11:37,702 --> 00:11:41,014
is going to be attached to a network. That network is going to have perimeter

184
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:44,494
security of some type. It's going to have physical security of some

185
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,954
type, and it's going to have policies,

186
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,814
procedures, and a security education and training program

187
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:54,706
wrapped around it so that everybody can make sure that

188
00:11:54,728 --> 00:11:58,706
these model we use, which is really these overlapping layers of

189
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:02,158
security, is in place and working correctly.

190
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,794
Now, as a programmer, you may not be directly involved

191
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:08,680
with a lot of these, but web application, security,

192
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,790
traffic optimization,

193
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,446
those kinds of things are going to be areas where

194
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,962
you can contribute. They're going to be areas where the cybersecurity

195
00:12:19,026 --> 00:12:22,906
folk may actually want to put a little python program in place to

196
00:12:22,928 --> 00:12:26,938
look at some things. But we've got overlapping layers for

197
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:30,650
a reason. That means we're going to have, if we take email as an example,

198
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,394
we may have three or four different pieces of software or hardware

199
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:37,774
devices that actually touch an incoming piece

200
00:12:37,812 --> 00:12:41,150
of mail, and they'll do different things along the way,

201
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,246
so that if one of these layers of security

202
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:49,134
misses a bad actor or misses something, one of the other layers

203
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:52,226
will catch it. And that's really what overlapping layers are all about.

204
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:56,134
Now, today, it's kind of like the sign says we want the AI inside.

205
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:59,766
Artificial intelligence is going to give us the

206
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:03,174
insight into how the data moves and how

207
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:06,402
the humans on the network actually interact.

208
00:13:06,466 --> 00:13:10,026
And once it learns our normal standard behavior. These, it's going

209
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:13,446
to be able to alert us to anything that's abnormal, and that's really what we're

210
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:16,618
after. If you look at the first layer in any security model, you're going

211
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:20,414
to have that security incident management that we saw earlier, your web app,

212
00:13:20,452 --> 00:13:23,626
security content filtering, traffic optimization,

213
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:27,130
firewall, VPN, intrusion prevention detection,

214
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,606
load balancing, those kinds of things, all indicators of

215
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:34,970
a really sound first layer. And then the second layer complements

216
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,286
the first layer. We're going to look at our threat intelligence, and here's

217
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,858
where we really come into that triad on the left side of the screen here.

218
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:45,822
As you're going down that column, you're going to see threat intelligence. Every cybersecurity

219
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:50,062
program needs to know what threats areas in the wild. A vulnerability assessment

220
00:13:50,126 --> 00:13:53,622
requires you to know all the assets on your network talked about that.

221
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,994
So if you know the threats that are coming in and you know the assets

222
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:01,222
on your network, you can make an intellectual decision on what your vulnerabilities

223
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:04,458
really are. If we take a step back to

224
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:09,238
something like a patchwork quilt of effects

225
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:13,198
that came into being over intel processors that we

226
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:15,966
euphemistically gave a couple of labels to,

227
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:20,142
you're going to find that even though there was a threat there,

228
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:23,662
there was a vulnerability in those old IBM

229
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:27,090
processors, and Microsoft did have a patch for it.

230
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,046
You'd find that as we went through the process of identifying

231
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,294
those threats, I hate to call them threats

232
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,738
because there wasn't really anything we could do about it. But as we're

233
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:42,546
looking at those old threats that came in and looking at patching

234
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:46,486
them, the patch would break the computer. And what

235
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:50,706
I'm talking about is Spectre and meltdown. When Spectre and Meltdown came about,

236
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:54,202
there was a lot of organizations that threw up the red flags and said,

237
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:57,100
oh, my, these are threats. Great.

238
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,002
Did we have that vulnerability? Well, yeah, everybody had them. We all had intel

239
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,766
processors running somewhere. Microsoft came up with a

240
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:07,614
patch for the Windows servers. And, oh,

241
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:11,294
yes, in testing, the patch worked, but it

242
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:15,006
broke the apps that were on the server. Break is probably too

243
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:18,690
strong a word. It slowed them down to the point that it appeared broken.

244
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,674
Not really a functional fix. We had at that time to

245
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:26,374
defend the perimeter against anything that would come in so that

246
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:30,834
we could not see or allow any spectre or meltdown

247
00:15:30,962 --> 00:15:34,486
weaponization within our networks. And of course, we've got

248
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:37,442
these tried and true access control authentication,

249
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:41,046
endpoint security, email security recovery and backup.

250
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,118
You want to put a halt to ransomware,

251
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:47,626
make sure you know your backup and recovery cycle. And make sure

252
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:51,082
you know that you're doing it in isolated network segments.

253
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:54,586
Make sure you understand your backup, whether it's

254
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:57,854
towers of Hanoi or mix and match, or last

255
00:15:57,892 --> 00:16:02,510
in, first out, whatever backup and recovery methodology you're choosing,

256
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,610
make sure that that methodology will

257
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,098
get you a recovery point. If you end up

258
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:13,986
with ransomware. It's really incredibly important that

259
00:16:14,008 --> 00:16:17,426
you do that. The third layer in any model is encryption. As you

260
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,738
can see. The second word on every one of these bricks, these are the bricks

261
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:24,086
in the wall for your castle. Every single one of them has encryption at

262
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,446
the bottom. You want data encryption, you want email encryption, and you want

263
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:31,034
device encryption when it's practical. That's your third layer and your

264
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:34,538
center layer, and that's going to really create this layered security

265
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:38,794
model for you. So you're seeing everything put together

266
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:42,906
in one model, one wall of that entire castle

267
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:46,494
of the castle doctrine as we're going through this,

268
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:50,858
that will give you what you need for cybersecurity

269
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:54,686
today. The other component that I'm going to suggest

270
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:58,242
is one we cannot live without any longer,

271
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:02,354
is the AI insight. Artificial intelligence allows us

272
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:06,274
to watch, monitor and alert on

273
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:10,218
all the activity on the network. So we can watch all the data that's

274
00:17:10,254 --> 00:17:14,034
going by in the river, we can watch all the data that's in a lake,

275
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:17,490
we can watch all the data that's in a data ocean. And we can actually

276
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,482
parse it with AI and find the points that we need to

277
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:25,398
find to determine if there's been data exfiltration,

278
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:28,982
or if there's been some access control violation,

279
00:17:29,126 --> 00:17:32,214
or if one of our end users has decided

280
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:35,486
they want to zip up everything they've been working on and take it

281
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:38,590
home with them. I don't know why, but for some reason,

282
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,814
human beings in the last two weeks of their employment with any organization feel

283
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:46,514
it's a moral imperative to zip up all their files and take them with

284
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:49,986
them. Well, the AI inside can help you spot that and can

285
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:53,026
help you eliminate that once and for all.

286
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,646
And again, I want to caution you and remind you

287
00:17:56,668 --> 00:18:00,098
that one size doesn't fit all. There's no way you're

288
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:03,842
going to take a corporation that's a billion dollar corporation

289
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:07,410
or a trillion dollar corporation and use the

290
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,590
same tools, the same cybersecurity tools and setup

291
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,122
as you would a mom and pop shop. Completely different size

292
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:20,006
organizations require a completely different

293
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:23,194
methodology for making sure that they're secure.

294
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:27,006
Now, to avoid any mistakes in

295
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:30,746
cybersecurity, we always have a choice to communicate

296
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:33,678
or speculate within the cybersecurity community.

297
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:37,314
We communicate threats just as quickly as we can to as many people

298
00:18:37,352 --> 00:18:40,850
as we can. Within your organization, if you think something's wrong,

299
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,002
it's up to you to communicate it to the proper channels. And again,

300
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,478
every organization is going to be different. I would rather have a

301
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:50,994
lot of false positives, a lot of people within the organization communicating

302
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,570
things that turned out to be false positives,

303
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,414
as opposed to them sitting around and wondering because

304
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:00,762
everybody in the organization is part of the cybersecurity team. Remember,

305
00:19:00,816 --> 00:19:04,746
cybersecurity is a team sport. Having said that, not everybody has the

306
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:09,418
same cybersecurity awareness, not everybody has the same cybersecurity training.

307
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:13,386
So within your organization, make sure that you've allowed

308
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:17,610
for that communication, and make sure that you understand a typical

309
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,306
CMMI model or capability maturity model index.

310
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:25,486
If you look at the small organizations, you're going to see that they're characterized

311
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:29,122
by the level one that you would see down

312
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:32,610
here on this level. That's going to be

313
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,406
competent people and heroic efforts keeping everything running.

314
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:41,042
Now, unfortunately, as operations grow, they don't always compensate

315
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:44,386
for that. They still will have a lot of very heroic

316
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:48,326
efforts. Competent people working long hours to make things work. But as you

317
00:19:48,348 --> 00:19:52,234
go up the model, you see we've got basic project management and we're starting

318
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:56,410
to use different tactics to make sure that the organization has

319
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,858
processes and procedures in place. And the level these

320
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:04,474
of any model, you're going to see that process standardization comes on.

321
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:08,650
We're going to have the five P's. This is our process, these are our procedures.

322
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,694
This is how the projects work. These areas, the people that are on it,

323
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:14,658
and it's all standardized. You get up to a level four,

324
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:18,514
you're going to look at the common approaches to

325
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,066
quantitative analytics taking their place

326
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:25,458
beside everything else that's going on. So you're going to measure and count,

327
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:28,646
you're going to quantify what's going on. It's a simple thing,

328
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:32,482
but you have to be a fairly large organization to be able to afford quantitative

329
00:20:32,546 --> 00:20:35,894
analytics. And five, that would be something that would happen

330
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:39,334
with the federal government or with one of the big defense industrial

331
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:43,926
contractors, something that would allow them to move their folks

332
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:48,026
around in a manner that would give the organization the

333
00:20:48,048 --> 00:20:51,802
opportunity to take full advantage of continuous process improvement,

334
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:55,694
because that's something that a large manufacturer has

335
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:58,842
to constantly do, those process improvement cycles.

336
00:20:58,906 --> 00:21:02,362
And you want to look at this model as it fits into the cybersecurity

337
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:06,090
department, and you want to look at how it fits into your information assurance

338
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,614
and your cybersecurity as well as your governance,

339
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:13,682
risk and compliance. Those are all areas you need to make sure areas

340
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:16,210
taken care of in any size organization,

341
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:20,422
bigger the organization, the more formal the process. A small

342
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:23,878
business is not going to have the same type of

343
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:27,574
cybersecurity that everybody else does. They're going to be using a different class

344
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:30,826
of routers, switches, hubs, firewalls and that sort

345
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:34,426
of thing. They'll be using the smaller products by Sonicwall and

346
00:21:34,448 --> 00:21:37,606
Fortinet and some of the other vendors.

347
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,334
CISO has some small products for small businesses.

348
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:45,182
I say small products. They have some scaled down products for small business

349
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:48,942
that are very effective. So all those types of things are going to be coming

350
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:52,480
into play as we draw near

351
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,926
to keeping our confidentiality and integrity

352
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,046
and availability model intact. You're going to be pulling

353
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:03,854
in everything you can still creating that castle doctrine

354
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:07,126
model, but you're going to be doing it with a different tool set. You're not

355
00:22:07,148 --> 00:22:10,994
going to have as much flexibility. You won't see as much data passing

356
00:22:11,042 --> 00:22:15,702
through your filters and through any

357
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:19,366
particular program you're using inside to determine what's going on.

358
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:23,430
And that's really a level one organization. If you look at this particular slide,

359
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,818
you're going to have a lot of mom and pop shops that are going to

360
00:22:25,824 --> 00:22:29,014
be having a router and wifi and a firewall,

361
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:33,006
and they'll have printers, laptops and desktops attached to these.

362
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:36,350
It's a simple model. It's every mom and pop shop

363
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,698
that I've ever been in. And again, they're going to be using not necessarily

364
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:44,874
the industrial strength router switches and hubs that we had used in a larger

365
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:48,258
organization, but they're still going to have them. They're still going to be using them

366
00:22:48,424 --> 00:22:52,482
no matter how big or how small. We get these

367
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:56,414
four points of alignment areas going to be mission critical

368
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,890
for you. The economics, the talent, the existing equipment,

369
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,026
and the function. I can't tell you how many times I've

370
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,646
seen an organization want to replace a piece of software when

371
00:23:06,668 --> 00:23:09,994
it had the functionality they needed. They just hadn't gone

372
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:13,194
to class, didn't understand, hadn't taken the time to

373
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:16,694
find out, or hadn't upgraded that particular piece of software

374
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:19,830
to its latest model that would give them that functionality.

375
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,466
The other thing, and that's part of looking at your existing equipment,

376
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:26,506
because what we have on the ground have the right functionality.

377
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:30,138
The existing equipment is identifying that asset.

378
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:32,878
Do we have assets in place that will do that right now, or do we

379
00:23:32,884 --> 00:23:36,066
need new assets and then talent? We have to

380
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:39,554
have people that know how to corporate in the environment we're in,

381
00:23:39,672 --> 00:23:43,058
you're always going to have folks that are turning over.

382
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:47,022
You're going to have new employees, you're going to have current employees terminating

383
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:50,086
and moving out. But you're going to have to make sure that you've got the

384
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:53,686
talent to run your equipment, no matter what size you are. And it's got

385
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:57,398
to be economically effective. Again, your C suite is going to

386
00:23:57,404 --> 00:24:01,030
be doing everything they can to make sure that the organization

387
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:05,034
stays afloat and make sure that the organization does not go

388
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:08,666
broke. So you've got to take a look at the economics of it.

389
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:12,214
And part of that is saying, okay, if I've got an asset that's a dollar,

390
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:15,326
I don't want to spend a dollar to secure it. You're going

391
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:19,086
to have a risk appetite statement within your organization. You're going to have

392
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:22,798
to use that risk appetite statement and the risk assessment process

393
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:26,466
to make sure that these economics are aligning with the

394
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:30,238
risk, so that if you've got an asset that's worth a dollar,

395
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:34,354
you might spend $0.10 securing it. That's simple,

396
00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:37,798
but exactly what you want to do.

397
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:41,954
And we need to have an understanding of routers and how routers

398
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:44,646
work and switches and hubs and that sort of thing,

399
00:24:44,748 --> 00:24:48,490
especially within these cybersecurity team. But it

400
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,198
also doesn't hurt for anybody that's in programming

401
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:55,382
to understand these things. Single band, dual band,

402
00:24:55,446 --> 00:24:59,974
that kind of deal. Are you doing anything that's

403
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:03,114
going to securing your wide area network or your routers?

404
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:07,022
We've got wired connectivity everywhere, especially when we moved everybody home.

405
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:10,400
Everybody's working on a wireless network at their house.

406
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,734
Could be trouble if you don't have the right security in place. It would behoove

407
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:18,706
as programmers to understand these difference in

408
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,414
wired and wireless and to understand a single wan versus

409
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:25,634
a dual wan, how that works, these types of things are

410
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:29,278
mission critical for us. And remember our four points of alignment.

411
00:25:29,454 --> 00:25:32,566
You got to always go back as you're looking through here at

412
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:36,434
the economics, the talent, your equipment on the ground, and the functionality

413
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:39,318
that equipment's giving you. It's not going to change.

414
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:42,886
If you look at the Internet today. Thank you,

415
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:46,202
Kopersky, for this picture. If you look at the Internet traffic today,

416
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:50,106
and this is just one rendering of it, this is what's going on all the

417
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:53,582
time now. The opportunity for something to break or something to

418
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:57,050
have a hold that's not plugged in it in a network that's

419
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,426
literally worldwide is incredible. So as we've

420
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:04,282
got nation states, and really sophisticated bad actors

421
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:08,026
trying to take advantage of it. It behooves us to look at how

422
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,474
we're going to handle the next level up. When we come out of the mom

423
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:14,706
and pop shop and we get into a growing organization, we're going to have

424
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:18,486
multiple routers, we're going to have multiple wireless networks, we're going to

425
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:22,370
have multiple points of entry, multiple points of egress.

426
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:26,150
It's going to be a battle to make sure that as

427
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,038
the equipment grows, so does our capability,

428
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,682
so that we are absolutely able to take advantage of

429
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:36,186
every nuance and every single thing that's available

430
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:40,066
to us in the products and services that we bring to bear

431
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:44,078
to secure that organization. Now, the third level,

432
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:46,686
believe this is a CISO diagram. So thank you,

433
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:50,960
Cisco. If you look at this, you can see how

434
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:55,410
we start out with a lot of equipment on,

435
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,346
usually the ground floor, and then we move up. But each one

436
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:03,186
of these racks supports multiple users. As we

437
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:06,738
go across, it's imperative

438
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:10,370
that we look at standardizing our requirements

439
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,146
development, our technical solutions, our product integration,

440
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,682
the verification and validation, the process focus and definition,

441
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:21,274
the organizational training. All of those things need

442
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:25,622
to be dialed into a comprehensive approach to managing cybersecurity.

443
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:28,794
And at this point, we're going to have log files turned on.

444
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:32,838
We're going to have a sim running so that we're collecting data, not all

445
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:36,734
the data, but we're going to be looking at specific data elements coming

446
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:41,038
out of every computer. We're going to be looking at specific data

447
00:27:41,124 --> 00:27:44,650
elements that we're going to be parsing out with tools like Python

448
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,870
to make sure that those organizations are safe.

449
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,746
And as we move on to the fourth level, and this is definitely a

450
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:55,426
Cisco design, you are going to have multiple buildings. You're looking

451
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:59,810
at a campus structure here. This is where you need that quantitative approach.

452
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,002
We need to be looking at tools that are going to help active directory.

453
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:07,510
And remember, active directory has two flavors. There's one

454
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,386
ad for hosted, which this is a pretty good diagram of,

455
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:15,434
and there's a different ad for these cloud,

456
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:19,274
for the azure cloud, that is. And we want to make sure that we

457
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:22,878
understand those different directory structures. We want to make sure that we understand

458
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:26,494
everything that's different between hosting it ourselves and

459
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:30,410
what's in the cloud. And we're going to have quantitative project management

460
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,110
at this point, projects are going to be brought together into a project

461
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,586
portfolio, and there's going to be project portfolio management going

462
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:41,266
on, and it's all going to be based on numbers and resources, that sort

463
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:45,214
of thing. The organization is going to be bigger and much more spread

464
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:48,626
out at this point than it has been in the past. And it's going to

465
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:52,146
be imperative for the cybersecurity professional to make sure they can secure

466
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:55,734
it. And when you get to a level five, all of a sudden you're looking

467
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:59,030
at a department that's outsourced, you're looking at a new company

468
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,190
you're bringing in, you're merging. You're going to segregate a department

469
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,954
for regulatory requirements. We need a chinese firewall over there,

470
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:09,786
so wall those people off so they can't see all the other data,

471
00:29:09,888 --> 00:29:13,274
those kinds of things. And you're still going to have that campus communication fabric

472
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:17,258
from the prior slide that you're going to be working on that particular diagram

473
00:29:17,434 --> 00:29:21,374
in the lower half of this. Now, we also start doing something

474
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:24,882
early on that should be part of our process of

475
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:27,822
drilling down on any fault,

476
00:29:27,886 --> 00:29:31,262
flaw, error, intrusion, whatever is causal analysis.

477
00:29:31,326 --> 00:29:35,294
What caused it? If we're looking at the pipeline ransomware incident

478
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,870
that we're just experiencing, what caused it? Where did it come from?

479
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,662
What happened? And we're going to be making sure that

480
00:29:42,716 --> 00:29:46,166
we've got all of our intellectual property secured because that's our

481
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:49,670
competitive edge. That's exactly how that organization

482
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,734
that we're in differentiates itself from other organizations

483
00:29:53,782 --> 00:29:57,222
within the industry or within its particular area of expertise.

484
00:29:57,366 --> 00:30:01,018
We're also going to have artifacts that we need to be collecting along the

485
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:04,922
way. And this is another area where programming really helps.

486
00:30:04,986 --> 00:30:08,414
We're going to have threat hunting that. We're going to have to bring

487
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:12,222
in artifacts from log aggregation. Again, we don't take all the data

488
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,842
elements out of a log, we aggregate them, but we're collecting specific data

489
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:20,174
elements out of different types of computers. And we're looking at things like firewall clustering

490
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:23,726
and AI. We're using behavior analytics

491
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:26,850
to determine what Mary and John and Joe are doing on our network

492
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,326
and what's right and wrong with it. What kind of success are

493
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:34,520
Mary and Joe having in exfiltrating data? Are they actually

494
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,438
taking data out of the network for nefarious reasons, or are

495
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:41,618
they just copying it onto their laptop and taking it home so they can work

496
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:45,126
a couple of hours on it? We're going to look at things like incident response

497
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:48,634
and forensics. And when we think about forensics, there is a

498
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:52,270
chain of custody that must be maintained with any

499
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,154
forensic analysis. And you've got to make sure that you've got the necessary

500
00:30:56,202 --> 00:31:00,142
artifacts in place, the necessary projects, processes and

501
00:31:00,196 --> 00:31:04,094
procedures in place, so that when these things occur that

502
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:07,758
need forensic analysis, these things being incidents or events.

503
00:31:07,854 --> 00:31:11,074
You're going to want to make sure that that forensic analysis is

504
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:15,054
done according to a very specific set of processes you've

505
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:19,074
predefined, that maintain these chain of custody.

506
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:22,294
And of course that old training and cross training, I really

507
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:26,610
think we can't live without it. But that's just one man's opinion.

508
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,914
Your network endpoint defenses, we're always going to have

509
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:34,070
endpoint defenses, we're always going to have some firewalls

510
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,498
set up on the endpoints. We're always going

511
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:41,302
to have some kind of virus protection malware identification

512
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:44,622
on our endpoints, always going to be there.

513
00:31:44,676 --> 00:31:47,914
We want to make sure that we're doing HTTPs inspection,

514
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:51,562
that we've got all the bot protection that we can afford,

515
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:54,926
and that we've got application controls in place. And that's

516
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:58,226
another point that Python programmers can help, or any

517
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:01,540
programmer for that matter, in that application control,

518
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,662
because we've got to be able to predict exactly how those applications

519
00:32:05,726 --> 00:32:08,846
are going to react in certain circumstances.

520
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:12,502
And of course you're going to have that ur filtering. It's just going to be

521
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:15,958
part of that process. And by now you're going

522
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:17,960
to be saying, well, that's a lot.

523
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,282
Is that actually enough? Can we get by with that?

524
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:25,578
Well, probably not. Nothing's foolproof. It really isn't a

525
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:28,746
magic bullet. And if you give me enough time and money, I can pretty

526
00:32:28,768 --> 00:32:32,266
much get into anything. That's true of

527
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:35,350
any bad actor. And nation states have a

528
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,918
lot of money, so they can buy a lot of time, these can buy a

529
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:41,566
lot of hardware, a lot of software. The old thing true is

530
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:45,662
users do make mistakes. I have myself gotten

531
00:32:45,726 --> 00:32:48,946
in a time bind and been crunching things out for two or

532
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:52,770
three days at a time. Had our person that was doing

533
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,230
the phishing testing sent out an email

534
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,134
that looked exactly like you

535
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:04,280
have a phone message on our VoIP phone system. We had

536
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,102
little emails that come in that say this person called,

537
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:11,258
click these to hear the voicemail they left you.

538
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:14,666
Well, she sent that out. Looked exactly like it

539
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:17,786
to me. I'm in a rush, did not notice it, didn't come from

540
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:22,022
the right email address, clicked on it and instantly

541
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:25,646
got sent to additional training, which was

542
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:29,374
the correct thing to do. But users do make mistakes. We all get in

543
00:33:29,412 --> 00:33:32,554
time crunches, we all have bad days, we all have sleepless

544
00:33:32,602 --> 00:33:36,242
nights. Those types of things cause us to make mistakes at work.

545
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:40,242
It's up to the cybersecurity professionals within your organization to

546
00:33:40,296 --> 00:33:44,706
anticipate those. And of course, vendors make most.

547
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:48,722
I guess, in my mind, in my humble opinion, the two most vivid

548
00:33:48,786 --> 00:33:52,514
examples of vendor mistakes would be target and the bad actors

549
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:56,358
coming in through the HVAC vendor. And then the

550
00:33:56,364 --> 00:34:00,394
other vendor mistake that I would want to use

551
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:04,662
as a cautionary tale would be the Facebook example, where Facebook hired

552
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:08,502
Cambridge Analytica to do particular data science

553
00:34:08,566 --> 00:34:12,300
elements and data science work on their information.

554
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:16,214
Tons of data analytics going on, but that

555
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:19,662
not necessarily a secured place to be, and that data

556
00:34:19,716 --> 00:34:23,246
was repurposed several times before anything

557
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:26,882
happened there. Then the other

558
00:34:27,016 --> 00:34:30,322
thing that we have to be constantly aware of is what we don't see will

559
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:34,306
kill us. It's absolutely a mortal certainty that if

560
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:37,654
you don't see it, it's going to get your brute force attacks on all your

561
00:34:37,692 --> 00:34:41,554
assets or your local accounts, detect the invasion,

562
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:45,106
the local events, the privilege escalation, lateral movement

563
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:48,466
within your network. If you've got a network set up and you can't see lateral

564
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:51,990
movement in it, which is always indicators of those level one networks,

565
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,998
that could be a problem. So you have to make sure that the other companies

566
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:58,630
of your cybersecurity matrix, your overlapping cybersecurity

567
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,858
layers, are going to catch that lateral movement in different ways.

568
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:06,826
You also need to make sure that your new local user accounts

569
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:09,982
are being created appropriately, that you're not creating one for a bad

570
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:14,654
actor. And you've got to look for things like protocol poisoning, especially within

571
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:18,098
web applications. There's just tons of ways to

572
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:21,486
bust a web up. If you're not familiar with the OWASP

573
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:24,706
model, as a python programmer, I would suggest that you

574
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:28,398
get familiar with the OWASP model and that you make sure that everything

575
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:32,054
you do is going to be geared to

576
00:35:32,092 --> 00:35:35,366
one of those standards and that you're looking at that model as kind of

577
00:35:35,388 --> 00:35:38,694
guidelines. Like, okay, did we think of this areas? We covered for that. What happens

578
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:43,226
if this happens? What happens if that happens? Protocol poisoning being just one

579
00:35:43,248 --> 00:35:46,566
of those areas. The way we get to see what's

580
00:35:46,598 --> 00:35:50,454
going on is the AI inside machine learning. We can use things like cluster

581
00:35:50,502 --> 00:35:54,030
algorithms or add staff, and that's an expensive option.

582
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,566
I personally would rather add machines all day long than

583
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,862
to have to add staff. If you can automate it and not

584
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:04,174
have to add staff, you're going to have

585
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:07,874
the ability to remove the human factor out of the area,

586
00:36:07,992 --> 00:36:11,294
out of that equation. And if you look at the RSA

587
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:15,186
compromise that happened several years back, they had all the staff, they had all

588
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:19,038
the processes and procedures, but they were bringing so much information in and it

589
00:36:19,064 --> 00:36:22,374
was generating so many false positives that the humans that were looking

590
00:36:22,412 --> 00:36:25,846
at it were ignoring the errors that were indicating that there

591
00:36:25,868 --> 00:36:29,734
was a bad actor on the network. That's where the specialized applications come

592
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:33,878
in, the ones that actually start looking at what's going on laterally in networks

593
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:37,222
that understand exactly how to find that bad actor.

594
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:41,734
Take a look at that behavior, because really what we're talking about is behavioral analytics.

595
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:45,374
If we remember that a bad actor is going to be on

596
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,686
a network for like 280 days, give or

597
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:52,666
take, depending on who you listen to, before they actually start exfiltrating

598
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:55,986
data, that means they're going to be on the network and taking a hard look

599
00:36:56,008 --> 00:37:00,174
at what's going on. That gives us an opportunity. If we've got AI

600
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:03,934
and behavior analytics operational, it gives us a significant

601
00:37:03,982 --> 00:37:07,602
opportunity to make sure that every single thing

602
00:37:07,656 --> 00:37:10,914
on that network is being watched and that the anomalous

603
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,146
behaviors are being popped up and brought to a human's attention

604
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:17,430
to decide on whether or not an action needs to be taken.

605
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,106
But again, we've got to minimize the number of events these humans

606
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,866
have to make a decision on. So that means we've got to put a little

607
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:27,542
more time into developing our AI algorithms and our behavioral

608
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:31,246
analytics algorithms. It's imperative that we maintain those at a

609
00:37:31,268 --> 00:37:34,746
high level. We must make sure that we're

610
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:37,978
able to connect the dots and expose intruders.

611
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:41,994
That's another area where large data sets

612
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,114
are very useful. But if we don't have a tool like Python,

613
00:37:45,242 --> 00:37:48,930
if we can't write some quick and dirty, don't mean it in a bad way.

614
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,306
Quick and dirty programs to reach in and look at

615
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:56,242
the data, to do some data analytics on it, then we're never going to know

616
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:59,800
what's going on in the river or what those molecules are all about.

617
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,682
Don't forget that AI is going to give us the ability

618
00:38:03,746 --> 00:38:07,206
to scan our networks and all the devices on it and do these

619
00:38:07,228 --> 00:38:11,350
vulnerability assessments and create remediation workflows and tracking,

620
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:15,302
but it's only going to be giving us advice on those vulnerabilities.

621
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:18,634
So we've got to make sure that we're using it correctly and

622
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,882
that there's not a flaw in the process

623
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:25,040
or a hitch in the get along, as some people might say.

624
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,630
For our cybersecurity professionals, they've got to have complete

625
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,198
picture of everything that's going on. And if you look at the benefits

626
00:38:33,364 --> 00:38:37,234
well, we're going to keep our vulnerable systems on our radar and

627
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:40,386
watch them closely. We're going to look at the notifications we're getting from

628
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:44,574
those systems. We're going to be planning our remediation processes

629
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:48,406
and projects. We're going to be tracking remediation, and we're going

630
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:51,346
to be making vulnerability management workable.

631
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:55,542
Whole goal is to decrease our attack surface. Now having said

632
00:38:55,596 --> 00:38:59,354
that, I want to remind you that

633
00:38:59,552 --> 00:39:02,778
we are going to be looking at

634
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:06,186
threats, vulnerabilities, again, knowing all the

635
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:09,946
assets on that network and then looking at patch management and how we're going to

636
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:13,830
handle that to decrease those attack surfaces. And when you start identifying,

637
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:17,454
even in an organizational of let's say 800 people,

638
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:20,954
you may run some piece of software to go out and identify

639
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:24,174
all the assets on the network. And the first time I did it, it came

640
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:27,634
back with something like 8 million assets. And my

641
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:30,690
first reaction was we only have 800 people.

642
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,034
You don't think everybody has that many computers. But when I started

643
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:37,800
going through the file and parsing through it, I found that every

644
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,894
Adobe reader since dirt was

645
00:39:41,932 --> 00:39:45,126
on most of the machines that we had because we

646
00:39:45,148 --> 00:39:49,346
had an image that we were using when we renewed our pcs

647
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:52,758
through their normal lifecycle that had every one of

648
00:39:52,764 --> 00:39:56,170
those on it, it had all the updates, it had all the patches net

649
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,006
frameworks do the same thing. You're going to have net remnants

650
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:03,258
from dirt that are going to walk through your network. You've got to be

651
00:40:03,264 --> 00:40:06,414
able to look at those data sets, parse those out and say, okay,

652
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:10,366
those 1st 27 Adobe's we can get rid of, then you've got to have

653
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:13,834
a process and a project to get rid of them, eliminate any potential

654
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:17,314
vulnerabilities that they may have had. And again, we're always looking

655
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:21,234
at decreasing that attack surface. That's where we're trying to get to.

656
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:25,162
And then you've got to tell people what you're doing. In cybersecurity.

657
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:28,930
It's very important that we report our activities

658
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,706
and we report what's going on so that everybody in the organization

659
00:40:32,818 --> 00:40:36,214
can have a vivid understanding of

660
00:40:36,332 --> 00:40:39,782
exactly what's happening. We're going to report to the board

661
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:43,146
quarterly, at least if not monthly, to a committee of

662
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:47,366
the board, which would be the audit committee, the compliance committee, the technology committee,

663
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:51,206
and those sorts of things. Those committees, again quarterly if not monthly.

664
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:54,954
And if we're reporting into a committee of the board, that board committee is

665
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:58,126
going to turn around in the very next board meeting and report up to the

666
00:40:58,148 --> 00:41:01,854
board so we can cover that in that manner. We want to make

667
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:04,942
sure that the CEO gets a monthly update or as needed.

668
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,578
PRN is a term from healthcare that means as needed,

669
00:41:08,744 --> 00:41:12,786
the point of keeping the CEO in these loop is because he or

670
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:15,954
she's going to be the person that everybody's going to turn around and look

671
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:19,394
at and say, what do we do now? And that

672
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:22,806
CEO is going to be the face of the organization. If we should have

673
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:25,958
an incident or if we should have a breach, you want to make sure the

674
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:29,926
senior management team isn't surprised again, monthly or as needed. And your

675
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:33,734
key stakeholders, the people that are heads of lines of business or department heads,

676
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:37,686
you want to make sure they're in the loop. They've got to be critically

677
00:41:37,798 --> 00:41:41,382
informed on everything that's going on within cybersecurity.

678
00:41:41,526 --> 00:41:45,214
Now, what do you put in those reports? Well, the board needs to know

679
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:48,794
something very simple. Are we safe? I've sat through governance

680
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,966
committee meetings, and you would try to explain something to

681
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:55,426
the committee that would have the senior management team on it or the board on

682
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:58,740
it, and they would start asking questions,

683
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,090
really, because they didn't really know what the words

684
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,706
meant. They might be asking the questions incorrectly. And when you

685
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:10,630
drill down in every instance, the bottom line is the men and women

686
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,086
that make up your board of directors and your senior management team want

687
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:17,426
to know one thing, are we safe? These it's up to us to give meaningful

688
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:21,146
metrics, budget performance and a snapshot of

689
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:24,902
our overall program status to those people, either monthly,

690
00:42:24,966 --> 00:42:28,486
quarterly and certainly annually. We certainly want to do an annual

691
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:31,738
recap for our board, committees of the board, same as the board,

692
00:42:31,824 --> 00:42:35,134
they want to know, are we safe? Your C suite. Well,

693
00:42:35,172 --> 00:42:37,934
you're going to do everything you're doing for the board. Plus you're going to add

694
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,406
in your threats and vulnerabilities and how they're affecting your

695
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:45,306
patch management. You want your C suite to understand what a threat

696
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:49,326
is, whether or not you've got that vulnerability on your network

697
00:42:49,438 --> 00:42:52,226
and what you're going to do to patch it, what process you're going to go

698
00:42:52,248 --> 00:42:56,014
through. And of course, you want to make sure your events, incidents and breach management

699
00:42:56,062 --> 00:42:59,638
processes are in place and your key stakeholders, you want to

700
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:03,734
do everything you're doing for the C suite, all of the above and

701
00:43:03,852 --> 00:43:07,438
that line of business information, it's all critical to what they're

702
00:43:07,474 --> 00:43:11,258
doing every single day in every single way. Now, we talked a

703
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:14,278
little bit about risks and identifying risks.

704
00:43:14,454 --> 00:43:18,438
Well, every organization should have a risk appetite statement.

705
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:22,170
Actually, in reality, maybe 30

706
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,882
40% of organizations have a formal risk appetite statement.

707
00:43:26,026 --> 00:43:29,406
The rest of the organizations may or may not even know what

708
00:43:29,428 --> 00:43:32,522
that means to say, hey, we need a risk appetite statement.

709
00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:35,726
Well, that just means how much of a loss are we willing

710
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:39,102
to endure before we're going to take corrective action

711
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:43,170
or mitigating action to reduce those risks? I always

712
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,166
encourage folks that I work with to just ask their chief financial officer,

713
00:43:47,278 --> 00:43:50,738
Mr. Or Miss CFO, what do you consider a material loss?

714
00:43:50,834 --> 00:43:53,798
The bank I worked at, the first time I asked it the first week I

715
00:43:53,804 --> 00:43:57,222
was there, these CFO said 25,000. The last

716
00:43:57,276 --> 00:44:00,582
week I was there, I asked him what a material loss was and he said

717
00:44:00,636 --> 00:44:03,626
300,000. If it's less than 300,000, I'm not going to worry about it.

718
00:44:03,648 --> 00:44:07,194
Anything over 300,000, I'm going to scrutinize heavily. So we

719
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:11,194
knew that the risk appetite for the organization was at the $300,000

720
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,862
mark. So any threat that was going to cost

721
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:18,718
us 300,000 or more, we needed to mitigate. Use a

722
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:21,886
framework, and there are many to choose from. In the US,

723
00:44:21,988 --> 00:44:25,134
you're looking at NIST and Europe. In the european theater,

724
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:28,626
you're looking at ISO. The Koso framework is always really good for

725
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:33,540
cybersecurity. Of course, the NIST 800 and ISO 27

726
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:38,362
and whatever will also have cybersecurity

727
00:44:38,446 --> 00:44:42,262
framework components in them. Those are places that you can go

728
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:46,386
to find out exactly what you ought to be doing. And of course you're

729
00:44:46,418 --> 00:44:50,178
going to have to do an assessment on whether or not it's working.

730
00:44:50,284 --> 00:44:54,060
And I always like to just use the old stoplight method. Is it good,

731
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,314
green, yellow or red? What process are we in?

732
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:02,218
What is our assessment going to look like? Well, the things that

733
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:06,334
we're going to assess are going to be our people,

734
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:09,646
our processes and our technology. Do the people have the

735
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:13,194
right training? Do they have the right set of program in place or our processes

736
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:17,074
there? Do we understand that tailgating is a bad thing in a secure area?

737
00:45:17,192 --> 00:45:21,054
Do we understand that not emptying our waste bins every evening

738
00:45:21,102 --> 00:45:24,354
into the shred bins is a problem? Do we understand our

739
00:45:24,392 --> 00:45:28,578
technology and we're keeping the CIA, the confidentiality, integrity and availability

740
00:45:28,674 --> 00:45:32,018
triad intact? Do we understand our threat

741
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:35,122
matrix, our vulnerability matrix,

742
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:39,126
and our patch management matrix? And are they actually working together? Are they

743
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:42,498
tied together? And we're going to look at our talent level, how can we

744
00:45:42,524 --> 00:45:45,658
improve it? Where do we need to shore it up? How can the talent that

745
00:45:45,664 --> 00:45:49,306
we've got in house laterally train others to bring them up

746
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:52,854
to that level? And we're going to look at our overall project management capability.

747
00:45:52,982 --> 00:45:56,218
And these are all assessments. And we're going to assess our standardization.

748
00:45:56,314 --> 00:45:59,694
Do we have standard ways of standing up a server do we have

749
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:03,354
standard ways of setting up a desktop? That standardization is critical

750
00:46:03,402 --> 00:46:06,978
to security of the organization? You don't really want to set up a

751
00:46:06,984 --> 00:46:10,594
lot of desktops and not restrict the

752
00:46:10,632 --> 00:46:14,226
admin account on those desktops and laptops, because people will

753
00:46:14,248 --> 00:46:17,026
go out to the Internet and they will find things they like and they will

754
00:46:17,048 --> 00:46:21,286
download them or they will click on things that will automatically download something.

755
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:25,030
You don't want to do that. You want to standardize it, lock them down,

756
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,418
see if you can't harden them as much as possible. You need a server hardening

757
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:31,322
policy. You need a desktop hardening policy,

758
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:35,350
and you want to start counting. You want to make sure that your quantitative

759
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:39,110
management capability is intact. You can quantify

760
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,634
everything you're doing, that you've got a baseline you're measuring against.

761
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:46,154
And these, you're always looking at that golden circle. And the golden circle

762
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:49,262
is just your area that you want to keep everything in.

763
00:46:49,316 --> 00:46:52,766
And that's if you look at these old Venn diagrams and put three of them

764
00:46:52,788 --> 00:46:56,206
together for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, where they

765
00:46:56,228 --> 00:46:59,458
all meet in the middle, that's your golden circle. You want to make sure that

766
00:46:59,464 --> 00:47:02,482
you've got the numbers to support that, that you're looking at these

767
00:47:02,536 --> 00:47:06,130
things that are mission critical to your organization.

768
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:09,686
The other things you want to do is to make sure that you understand the

769
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:13,442
skill level of people in your department, especially within cybersecurity.

770
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:17,526
We do this all the time. We take the person, what role they're in,

771
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:20,982
what skill level they're at, what their current scalability is,

772
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:24,442
what the ideal capability for that individual and that role would be.

773
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:27,674
And then we've got some development action. Are we going to send them to training?

774
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:31,662
In former lives, I made sure that my security teams and

775
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:35,422
my teams train for one week every

776
00:47:35,476 --> 00:47:39,102
quarter. So every 90 days, they were taking five days to train

777
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:42,666
on something. And while that may sound excessive, I would submit

778
00:47:42,698 --> 00:47:45,910
that Moore's law has been cut in half, that we're

779
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,694
now down to an 18 month life cycle on new equipment

780
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:53,426
coming out that is so much better than the equipment we've got

781
00:47:53,448 --> 00:47:56,174
in place that it's going to be hard not to upgrade.

782
00:47:56,302 --> 00:48:00,262
And we see that with Apple upgrading to Big Sur,

783
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:03,414
all of a sudden we've got to have a hardware platform come up to meet

784
00:48:03,452 --> 00:48:07,606
that level of excellence. Because the new operations system is

785
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:11,434
little more than the old hardware platforms can

786
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,414
adjust to in some instances. And that happens with Windows,

787
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:19,114
as they develop new windows, that happens with Apple as they develop new

788
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:22,382
oss. It happens on our smart devices, on our

789
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:25,806
phones and tablets all the time. All of a sudden you'll have an

790
00:48:25,828 --> 00:48:29,162
iPhone or some other Android device

791
00:48:29,226 --> 00:48:33,194
that will not be able to utilize the new software

792
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:36,494
that's coming out or the software updates that you're updating automatically.

793
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,434
So compensate for that. I strongly suggest that five

794
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:43,810
days out of every 90, your team is training everybody

795
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,710
on your team, and they'll be training in different areas, but that training is critical

796
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:51,202
and you're going to look at your projects in a project portfolio

797
00:48:51,266 --> 00:48:55,158
manner as you grow. You want to make sure that you have a project

798
00:48:55,244 --> 00:48:58,874
status in place so that you can look at how a new project comes

799
00:48:58,912 --> 00:49:02,282
in, how those milestones are monitored, how you add

800
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:06,266
and manage resources to the project, people, money, time, and how

801
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:10,106
you track progress and these, the workloads. And you

802
00:49:10,128 --> 00:49:13,414
also want to make sure you close projects out. A lot of organizations,

803
00:49:13,462 --> 00:49:16,766
especially with cybersecurity projects, the project just kind of goes on and

804
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:20,254
on and on. A project that doesn't have a definite end is a process,

805
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:23,806
and that process may be broken if it doesn't have a stop and

806
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:26,714
a start in it. You want to make sure that you understand how to close

807
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:30,082
a project. If you've got a project going that you can't close

808
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:33,634
for any reason, call it a process, close the project and say,

809
00:49:33,672 --> 00:49:37,494
we now have this process in place, and away you go. Only real way

810
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:41,414
to make that happen for you. The rest of your project

811
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:45,650
portfolio dials into your project portfolio

812
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,446
management. You've got to make sure that you're strategically aligned with

813
00:49:49,548 --> 00:49:53,178
the strategy and tactics your organization is going to use.

814
00:49:53,264 --> 00:49:56,714
And you want to make sure that you can execute and deliver on

815
00:49:56,752 --> 00:50:00,630
everything that you're doing in a project. You're going to have tools and methods.

816
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,198
One of those tools for projects in a project portfolio environment,

817
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:07,742
it's always going to be a programming language. Python is a great one.

818
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,478
I see a lot of java, I see a lot of python. I'm starting to

819
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:14,654
see a little go. But predominantly python. For the cyber

820
00:50:14,702 --> 00:50:18,546
people in the tool set, always good governance. Got to

821
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:21,838
have that securing committee on these projects and make sure that you're

822
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:25,294
dialing in your existing governance. Your existing governance

823
00:50:25,342 --> 00:50:28,818
risk and compliance is going to inform you, or you're going to inform

824
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:32,358
them both on your project status and they're going to give you advice on how

825
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:36,246
to handle these projects. Absolutely a normal part of it. And if you

826
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:40,326
look at it governance, these two off on the right, the strategic

827
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:43,834
planning, you need an IT and a cyberstrategic plan.

828
00:50:43,952 --> 00:50:47,286
You also need a way to request projects and tasks.

829
00:50:47,398 --> 00:50:50,858
Now, I'm not saying the rest of that's irrelevant, but those two off on

830
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:54,938
the right, as far as governance is concerned, are your cornerstones.

831
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:58,634
What's these strategic plan for the organization? How does the it strategic

832
00:50:58,682 --> 00:51:02,174
plan and the cybersecurity strategic plan dovetail into

833
00:51:02,212 --> 00:51:06,218
that organization's plan? And how do we handle projects? How does

834
00:51:06,244 --> 00:51:09,586
a project get started, how does it run and

835
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,946
how does it close down? Those are two critical areas that you want to

836
00:51:12,968 --> 00:51:16,802
make sure you understand. And when we start talking about frameworks,

837
00:51:16,946 --> 00:51:20,582
these is, in my humble opinion, what those frameworks should be used

838
00:51:20,636 --> 00:51:25,010
for. NIST, CFS, of course, is cybersecurity. These CMM

839
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,694
is going to be software development, Koso Enterprise

840
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:32,522
risk management, Cobit going to give you some really

841
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:36,522
good controls. Itil itsm always

842
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:40,678
a good one to have. Itil one of the first ever

843
00:51:40,784 --> 00:51:44,254
attempts to say, this is how the whole thing that is, it should

844
00:51:44,292 --> 00:51:47,854
operate. Your ISO IEC 2700s

845
00:51:47,972 --> 00:51:51,486
cybersecurity, Togaf, Sackman, lots of frameworks out

846
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:54,990
there. Find one that works for you. If you're in the US,

847
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:58,334
you're going to look at NIST, probably if you're in Europe or Asia,

848
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:01,826
you're going to look at an CISO standard. Doesn't matter which

849
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:05,474
one you use. They all look about alike when you get down to the absolute

850
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:09,246
nuts and bolts of them. But make sure you've got a standard. Now,

851
00:52:09,288 --> 00:52:12,342
I always have a clock in my head, and I found out a few years

852
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:16,262
ago that not everybody does. So I've started including this in

853
00:52:16,316 --> 00:52:20,010
everything that I do. The clock in your head is

854
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,234
important. You've got to understand that. I have my teams justify their

855
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:27,494
technology every 18 months, because again, as we discussed,

856
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:31,694
Moore's law has been halved. So that what we're seeing is

857
00:52:31,812 --> 00:52:35,386
new products and services, new software updates, new patches

858
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:39,098
coming in that materially affect our operational capability.

859
00:52:39,194 --> 00:52:42,894
About every 18 months, training every three months,

860
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:46,418
each member of your team has to go to training. And calendar up is a

861
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:50,018
little tool that I kind of stumbled onto 40 years ago.

862
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:53,570
It's having a Monday morning meeting at 08:00 a.m. On Monday morning.

863
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,426
And just asking everybody around the table, set your team in

864
00:52:57,448 --> 00:53:00,534
a room or in a Zoom meeting, and just say what's on your calendar this

865
00:53:00,572 --> 00:53:03,734
week, just this week. And somebody might say, well,

866
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:06,786
I'm going to be out Friday, or I'm going to install a new router,

867
00:53:06,818 --> 00:53:09,926
or I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. Somebody else around the

868
00:53:09,948 --> 00:53:13,862
table, if somebody says, I'm going to install a new router on Wednesday.

869
00:53:14,006 --> 00:53:17,434
Somebody else around these table might go, oh no, you're not.

870
00:53:17,632 --> 00:53:20,874
I have to do this before you can do that. And I can't get that

871
00:53:20,912 --> 00:53:24,462
done until these other things happen. So that Monday morning

872
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:28,286
meeting and allowing the team, not you, but the

873
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:31,898
teams itself, to decide the work and the work pattern that's

874
00:53:31,914 --> 00:53:34,974
going to happen for the week is kind of critical. Now we may have

875
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:38,674
projects going, people may say, I'm working on Project A.

876
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:42,514
I got to be doing a this week. I'm all project a all

877
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:46,094
week. Well, that's great. You know what they're doing and they're pretty much

878
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:49,958
going to be busy all week. GRC, you want

879
00:53:49,964 --> 00:53:53,090
to have at least a monthly governance risk compliance meeting,

880
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:56,518
your framework adjustments every twelve to 18 months,

881
00:53:56,604 --> 00:53:59,638
no matter what in mws, no matter what.

882
00:53:59,724 --> 00:54:02,886
Take those frameworks out, take a look at them and make any adjustments

883
00:54:02,918 --> 00:54:06,426
you have to have or as needed. You may have a

884
00:54:06,448 --> 00:54:10,422
framework if you're in NIST, if you're in the finance industry, that NIST framework

885
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:13,134
may get updated every year and you may have to go back and say,

886
00:54:13,172 --> 00:54:17,354
okay, well, we're now doing business continuity management

887
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:20,926
and it's not working exactly according to the framework. So we need to kind

888
00:54:20,948 --> 00:54:24,654
of modify what we're doing to fit these framework. Your GA

889
00:54:24,702 --> 00:54:27,620
releases again, twelve to 18 months,

890
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,442
no more than that. And as

891
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:35,426
needed, vulnerability assessments, we do those daily. What new

892
00:54:35,448 --> 00:54:39,042
equipment is coming on the wire? What are we taking off of the wire?

893
00:54:39,186 --> 00:54:42,898
What vulnerabilities do we have? What's our exposure? What's our risk?

894
00:54:42,994 --> 00:54:46,358
And that clock keeps on ticking. Your risk assessments need

895
00:54:46,364 --> 00:54:49,526
to be done annually. Anytime you're adding a new product or service,

896
00:54:49,628 --> 00:54:53,274
the cyber people need to be doing that. So as needed as

897
00:54:53,312 --> 00:54:56,646
every new service, every new product comes about, we need to be doing a risk

898
00:54:56,678 --> 00:55:00,934
assessment on that product or service. Our code reviews development

899
00:55:00,982 --> 00:55:04,338
is a team sport as well. You don't develop in a vacuum.

900
00:55:04,454 --> 00:55:07,854
The days of being able to have an isolated programmer that

901
00:55:07,892 --> 00:55:11,406
creates all this magic and just throws it over the wall and we turn it

902
00:55:11,428 --> 00:55:14,720
on and just say it works or doesn't. That's in the past.

903
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,994
We've got to do things like adhere to the Owasp model.

904
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:22,702
It's absolutely critical for our web application development.

905
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:26,094
Everything's getting a web interface patches.

906
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:30,166
You want to make sure that you're patching something every week or as needed.

907
00:55:30,268 --> 00:55:34,242
Patch Tuesdays is areas thing. So as Microsoft releases patches,

908
00:55:34,306 --> 00:55:38,374
you want to make sure that you're testing those patches before you implement them and

909
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:42,290
making sure that they don't kill. Production system configuration.

910
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:45,802
You want to do that pre production. You don't want to configure a system

911
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:48,762
that's in production. I know some of you have done that,

912
00:55:48,896 --> 00:55:52,346
but it's not that good an idea. The other thing

913
00:55:52,368 --> 00:55:56,362
I want to make sure you understand is your cybersecurity roadmap.

914
00:55:56,506 --> 00:55:59,278
These are those milestones, your set of program, security,

915
00:55:59,364 --> 00:56:03,354
education, training, awareness. Number one thing to have in place, because cybersecurity

916
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:07,266
is a team sport. Know who your stakeholders are. Watch your budget. Watch your number

917
00:56:07,288 --> 00:56:10,770
of employees. What's your burn rate? Your burn rate is, how much money

918
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,894
do you spend every month to keep the wheels on cybersecurity

919
00:56:15,022 --> 00:56:18,594
from a programming perspective? How much money goes into our programming

920
00:56:18,642 --> 00:56:21,762
effort every month? And know your four P's, your policies, procedures,

921
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:25,126
processes, and projects. Make sure you know your security

922
00:56:25,308 --> 00:56:29,066
architecture and you're able to identify your

923
00:56:29,088 --> 00:56:32,682
assets. Don't forget the cross training. Whatever you do,

924
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:36,154
let's not forget the cross training. So, at this

925
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:40,214
point, you've built your castle. Everything should be fine.

926
00:56:40,352 --> 00:56:43,566
You should be rock solid on what you're doing,

927
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:47,946
and we're ready to talk about those elements that make a CiSO successful.

928
00:56:48,058 --> 00:56:51,338
Your EIQ, your emotional intelligence quotient,

929
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:55,118
mission critical. You may be the smartest technologist on the

930
00:56:55,124 --> 00:56:58,254
planet, but if you can't deal with people and you can't control your emotions,

931
00:56:58,302 --> 00:57:01,746
you're worthless in a corporate environment. So you got to make sure your

932
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:05,042
EIQ is there. Your iq, you only get

933
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:08,482
sharper if you keep learning. So you're going to be a continual

934
00:57:08,546 --> 00:57:12,354
learner. Is your technical

935
00:57:12,402 --> 00:57:15,782
ability kung fu or Krav maga? And if you know anything

936
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:20,118
about martial arts, you'll understand that kung fu is a very elegant sport.

937
00:57:20,214 --> 00:57:23,818
Krav Maga is awfully brutal, so there's a

938
00:57:23,824 --> 00:57:27,194
difference. Technologists tend to take one of those two tacks. They're either

939
00:57:27,232 --> 00:57:31,066
brutal or they're elegant. A lot of times you don't have time for

940
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:34,522
elegant, and you go with brutal. I would suggest that we all

941
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:38,282
start polishing our kung fu. We want to be a little more elegant,

942
00:57:38,346 --> 00:57:41,886
and you want to make sure that you understand high performance team building. And you

943
00:57:41,908 --> 00:57:45,838
got to understand third party risk management. Those pesky vendors will get you every

944
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:50,318
time. So if you have any questions, this is obviously recorded.

945
00:57:50,484 --> 00:57:53,838
You can give me a call, you can send me an

946
00:57:53,844 --> 00:57:57,286
email. You can look me up LinkedIn. I'll be happy to interact with you at

947
00:57:57,308 --> 00:58:00,370
any time, answer any questions. You might have comments,

948
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:04,150
criticisms, emotional outbursts, whatever it is, thank you

949
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:08,118
so much for spending this time with me, and please

950
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:09,650
have a great rest of your conference.
