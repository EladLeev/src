1
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,010
Are living in can era of technological marvels

2
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,942
wherein new industrial revolution is triggered by

3
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:30,520
new advances in science and technology.

4
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,298
We talk about different technologies like artificial intelligence,

5
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:38,918
machine learning, nanotechnology, cloud and virtualization,

6
00:00:39,014 --> 00:00:42,842
et cetera. But while developing any

7
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:46,490
new product we tend to forget the amount of

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,382
energy it is producing as well as the amount

9
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:53,662
of energy it is consuming. This is

10
00:00:53,716 --> 00:00:56,030
harming our environment gradually.

11
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,926
Have you ever thought how new

12
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:04,910
products that are being developed impact the environment?

13
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,110
Hello, I'm Dr. Anubha Jain.

14
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,886
I come from Pink City of India, Jaipur.

15
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:15,942
I am working as a director of School of Computer Science and it

16
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,506
at is deemed to be university Jaipur.

17
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:23,190
In my talk I'll be talking about the role of technology

18
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,474
in developing sustainable environment for us

19
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:31,430
and our coming generations to lead a safe

20
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,660
as well as a smart life.

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,610
I start with this funny video of Charlie Chaplin

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,546
wherein there is a mechanical device feeding charlie.

23
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:45,850
This was a technological marvel of its time, but science

24
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,600
and technology has come a long way since then.

25
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,790
We are heading towards a world of communication

26
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,046
and connectivity as well predicted

27
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,940
by a futurist. Everything will be connected to everything.

28
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,114
We are witnessing a world wherein devices

29
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,470
are talking to other devices.

30
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,330
Individuals are connected and communicating

31
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,662
to devices at higher scales

32
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:21,046
which were unknown previously. And central

33
00:02:21,078 --> 00:02:24,230
to this concept of communication is connectivity.

34
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,378
Things around us are connected together in

35
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:32,110
a mesh of smart devices which

36
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,786
communicate with each other over the Internet seamlessly,

37
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:38,960
thus forming Internet of things.

38
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,554
This is transforming the way we live and we

39
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:47,022
work. And as we can see from this graph

40
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,370
generated by Statista,

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,098
the number of IoT connected devices worldwide

42
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:57,880
has been increasing. In fact,

43
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,974
from 2020 to

44
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:06,050
2030 it is expected that these devices

45
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,530
will triple down from 9.7 billion to

46
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,250
29.4 billion devices.

47
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,650
And most of this share of

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,090
devices are from consumer segment

49
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,714
like smartphones and your autonomous

50
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:28,026
vehicles, it infrastructures, asset tracking,

51
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:31,520
monitoring and asset growth. In fact,

52
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,906
National Intelligence Council of us has

53
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:40,222
identified six civil disruptive technologies

54
00:03:40,366 --> 00:03:44,210
that are going to rule the world and Internet of Things

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,086
is assumed to be one of them. By 2025,

56
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:52,054
IoT will be residing in each and

57
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:55,670
every device that you use, maybe food, package, furniture,

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,580
paper, document or anything else.

59
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,062
Now, what is fueling this IoT revolution?

60
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:07,130
As we all know, the electronics are getting more

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,120
compact yet more powerful and widely available.

62
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,690
At the same time, the backbone of your Internet

63
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,610
is getting stronger. The Internet infrastructure

64
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,138
has advanced from three g to five g.

65
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,086
Thus the protocol has also improved

66
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:30,722
and the adoption of IPV six has increased the number

67
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:34,114
of available unique identifiers that

68
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:37,874
we have. So each device may get a

69
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:41,578
unique address and still addresses may remain vacant.

70
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:45,910
So there will be a time where more connective devices than people

71
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,060
will be available to us.

72
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,294
Now. The enabling technologists for IoTs,

73
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:57,926
RFID sensors in actuators, smart technologies technologists

74
00:04:58,118 --> 00:05:01,818
for tracking the data as well as processing

75
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:05,326
and drawing decisions from this data.

76
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:09,898
Along with societal and technological challenges,

77
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:13,858
there are environmental challenges being faced by IoT. So the

78
00:05:13,864 --> 00:05:17,954
growth of IoT does not come for free. It has a

79
00:05:17,992 --> 00:05:22,260
major impact on environment. Let's look at IoT how

80
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,470
as the number of connected devices are increasing,

81
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,830
the energy being consumed by these devices is again increasing

82
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,590
and the usage of batteries is increasing.

83
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,170
Also, electronic appliances production has

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,058
raised as we need more devices to safer to

85
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:47,738
people. All this have resulted in

86
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:51,790
increased e waste and landfills

87
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,338
plus greenhouse gas emission.

88
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:59,034
This all has led to something called global warming.

89
00:05:59,162 --> 00:06:02,750
Thus the concern of environment

90
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,330
and sustainability is at break in case of

91
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,810
IoT. Thus,

92
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,634
the solution for all this is should we do away with

93
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:17,638
technology? No, we should use technology

94
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:21,942
for a better tomorrow. In order to build a

95
00:06:21,996 --> 00:06:25,250
safe smart world, which is sustainability,

96
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,650
it is of utmost importance that we go

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,954
green. Thus we have to become

98
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:37,014
green in using these connected IoT devices

99
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,606
also. So the green IoT is a

100
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:44,766
scenario where we optimize Internet usage to save energy

101
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:48,270
by judiciously using available resources,

102
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,234
by using renewable sources of energy and

103
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,730
building energy efficient procedures.

104
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,874
Now this greening in IoT can

105
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:02,994
be done by greening can

106
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:06,710
IoT or greening by IoT.

107
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,626
While greening of IoT focuses on manufacturing

108
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:14,854
energy efficient IoT hardware as well as

109
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:18,582
building greener software. While greening

110
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,294
by IoT involves IoT as an enabler

111
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,486
to create a sustainable environment. So let's

112
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:30,054
look at it into detail that how

113
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:34,062
greening of IoT and greening by IoT can

114
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:37,278
build sustainability solutions. Now,

115
00:07:37,364 --> 00:07:40,762
first we look at IoT as a game changer.

116
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:45,362
IoT has just transforming the entire world by

117
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:49,038
making all the devices smart, maybe in the sphere

118
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,838
of industrial automation, homes,

119
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:55,798
transport, healthcare, agriculture or

120
00:07:55,884 --> 00:07:59,334
any other industry. So let's look at some

121
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:02,838
important use cases where IoT has been

122
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:05,830
used to build sustainable solutions.

123
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,626
So the first and foremost use case that we see

124
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:13,658
is the safer management that we can do at different

125
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,366
levels. Maybe household offices at sea

126
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:20,750
level or wastewater management.

127
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,650
Smart utility meters can be applied

128
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,138
for real time power usage monitoring that collect,

129
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:31,690
store and send data to smartphones

130
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,074
to manage energy and water consumption at

131
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:38,740
households and at office and industry level.

132
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,390
At sea level, aquaculture can be done wherein IoT

133
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,762
systems track animal health and environmental factors

134
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:51,810
that impact them to adjust the conditions

135
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,194
for happier and healthier fish. It will help in decreasing

136
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:59,526
time to market as well as reduce

137
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:02,746
the waste by doing predictive analysis that

138
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:06,380
will help farmers for faster harvest and

139
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,862
looking upon what and how much fish will eat based

140
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:15,258
on different temperature levels, health timing, et cetera.

141
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:19,182
Also, it will comply with environmental and food

142
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:23,234
safety regulations. The next important use

143
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:27,138
case is smart homes or

144
00:09:27,224 --> 00:09:31,134
smarter offices wherein smart

145
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:35,274
lighting, demand driven heating and cooling for improved

146
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,454
comfort in homes as well as offices can help

147
00:09:38,492 --> 00:09:42,566
in saving energy consumption as well as

148
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,486
energy start certified thermostats can be used

149
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,994
which can learn what temperature users prefer to

150
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:53,942
build a schedule around that setting to make buildings

151
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:57,510
more sustainable. During pandemic,

152
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,010
the overall energy consumption of New York City reduced

153
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,030
approximately by 15% by using

154
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,830
this smart lighting technique.

155
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,662
Then IoT plays a pivotal role in smart healthcare

156
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:17,714
by building smart telemedicine services

157
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:21,202
and predictive health care

158
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:24,210
monitoring for betterment of society.

159
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,470
It was seen during pandemic that senior citizens started

160
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,910
using more of telemedicine services and

161
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,382
IoT devices helped along with big data

162
00:10:35,436 --> 00:10:39,034
and analytics for quicker diagnosis of health issues

163
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:43,286
and also decrease the expenses of hospitals

164
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:46,906
in terms of system cost and for patients in

165
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:50,170
terms of actual visit to hospital.

166
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:54,970
Smart city is another example of IoT

167
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,730
making the life sustainable by smart parking,

168
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,090
structural health, noise, urban maps, smart detection,

169
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,178
traffic congestion management, safer management,

170
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:09,134
etc. IoT can also help in maintaining

171
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:14,126
biodiversity of wildlife as well as marine organisms

172
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:17,880
by making use of technologies like

173
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,242
drone technology, acoustic monitoring.

174
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:25,958
In fact, the connected collars which have been used

175
00:11:26,044 --> 00:11:30,714
by smart breeding management systems allow

176
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:34,662
farmers to increase production while minimizing

177
00:11:34,726 --> 00:11:38,150
cost and the use of resources.

178
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,018
It allows the breeder to get information about animals conditions

179
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:46,746
and behavior of their body temperature,

180
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:50,458
ovulation, gestation period, et cetera,

181
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:54,690
which can be helped to maintain better

182
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,734
health of animals and they can locate their livestocks

183
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:02,434
using connected sensors. Another use

184
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,974
case is in smarter waste management which can help

185
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:09,686
in optimized routing of the

186
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:13,430
garbage and cleaning of garbage can

187
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,022
and properly dumping of them at the manufacturing plant

188
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:21,690
using IoT devices. Then we have something

189
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,380
known as Internet of energy.

190
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,142
IoT can be employed for improving energy efficiency,

191
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:32,558
increasing the share of renewable energy and

192
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,840
reducing environmental impacts of energy.

193
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,554
Using IoT devices the energy industry is creating

194
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:43,874
something known as Internet of energy to

195
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:47,090
manage energy generation and different energy

196
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,510
resources. Big data analytics

197
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,958
provide grid operators energy producers with real time

198
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:59,026
energy consumption trends, allowing them to forecast

199
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:02,742
where and when energy demand of energy consumption will

200
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:06,898
peak. Direct adjustments in the energy supply

201
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:09,740
can be done as needed.

202
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,754
These are the allied technologies which

203
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:18,330
can be used with IoT for making the world greener.

204
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,206
These technologies, along with mathematical algorithms are

205
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:26,218
making IoT more intuitive and user friendly.

206
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:30,218
Energy and facility management software based on AI

207
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:34,350
are being devised as part of green IoT movement

208
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,814
and it is adopting nanotechnology to design smaller nanoscale

209
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:41,758
devices for improved functionality,

210
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:45,474
energy efficiency and accuracy while reducing

211
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:49,698
the size. This is the green IoT lifecycle.

212
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:53,750
So for any IoT product to become green,

213
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,742
it must go through a closed process,

214
00:13:56,876 --> 00:14:00,106
including green design to green production to

215
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:03,514
green deployment as well as disposal of

216
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:07,322
the product should be in a greener way such that it can be

217
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:11,942
recycled. Green design involves designing cooling

218
00:14:12,006 --> 00:14:16,690
equipment, servers, computers and energy efficient components.

219
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,286
So the sustainability design is the first

220
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:24,690
initiating point where in greenness should

221
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,078
enter in the lifecycle.

222
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:32,446
It will be carried forward in different phases of the lifecycle

223
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,974
in producing computers, electronic components and

224
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:39,878
other associated subsystems and it will

225
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:44,338
be monitored to keep these electronic items

226
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:48,950
power usage to a minimum and developing

227
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,442
recyclable electronic equipments so that

228
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:56,310
whenever they are no longer in use, they can be recycled

229
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,006
accordingly. Then we look at green

230
00:15:00,128 --> 00:15:03,770
in IoT. So how IoT procedures

231
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,330
can be made green. They can be made green by developing

232
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,750
hardware efficient devices.

233
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,786
Efficient software coding can be done. They can

234
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:18,514
be habitual based, awareness based, policy based as well

235
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:24,318
as recycling based. So building hardware

236
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:28,582
which is efficient the design of integrated circuits is

237
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,498
crucial for energy conservation. Green IoT

238
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:36,978
enhances IoT network architecture by integrating

239
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:40,502
sensors and processing powers on a single chip

240
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:44,678
to minimize total infrastructure energy consumption.

241
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:49,078
Also, the processors based with energy efficiency

242
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:53,274
can be split into two cores, low computing task

243
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:57,162
and high computing task and then scheduling framework

244
00:15:57,226 --> 00:16:01,470
can be used to assign tasks to reduce energy consumption.

245
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,210
In case of software,

246
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,226
the software should be built in such a way they

247
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:12,082
are energy efficient, carbon efficient as well

248
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:15,254
as they

249
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:18,754
are energy efficient carbon

250
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:22,470
efficient and they should be able

251
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,910
to work to optimize the hardware.

252
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,594
We should build our habits in

253
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:33,866
such a way that we all start thinking

254
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:37,020
of saving energy in our day to day lives.

255
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,470
Building such habits will build a very

256
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,310
small effect in saving upon energy, but when looked

257
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,910
upon IoT worldwide, it is definitely

258
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,010
going to make an impact and we should

259
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,082
also work on creating awareness about how

260
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:02,498
we can go green, how we can save energy by building

261
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:06,786
campaigns or maybe by giving notification

262
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:10,642
and alerts through phones, through software applications

263
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:13,862
so that people get a checkpoint on

264
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:18,054
how they are saving upon energy. And industry

265
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:21,610
is still building green policies in order

266
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,866
to build standards which are sustainable for companies

267
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:30,006
to practice. Now, the enabling technologies that

268
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,790
we saw earlier in case of Internet of things like

269
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,318
RFID, wireless, sensor networks, et cetera, they also

270
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:42,522
need to go green by making use of

271
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:46,638
recyclable material and smart

272
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:51,330
algorithms in order to become more sustainable.

273
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,342
So the RFID,

274
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:56,262
WSN or M two M,

275
00:17:56,396 --> 00:18:00,550
they all need to become more sustainable by making

276
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,818
use of more and more smarter algorithms,

277
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:08,810
energy harvesting mechanisms and different

278
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,210
scheduling practices. Even the data centers and

279
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,602
the cloud computing should become greener by

280
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:20,686
making use of virtualization techniques and

281
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:24,430
nanodata centers that are more energy efficient than

282
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,774
conventional data centers. Now we were

283
00:18:27,812 --> 00:18:31,454
talking about greenness and software. So we should build applications that

284
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:35,166
are hardware efficient, carbon efficient, energy efficient,

285
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:39,378
which should at the same time spread carbon awareness and

286
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:42,782
optimize each step of software development

287
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:46,198
lifecycle. This can be done using

288
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:49,894
green coding, low code development and

289
00:18:50,012 --> 00:18:53,510
automated software quality monitoring.

290
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,822
All these depend upon the factors

291
00:18:57,986 --> 00:19:00,970
like choice of language design,

292
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,982
encoding options, AIO models and different software

293
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:08,362
development techniques. As they all contribute to

294
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,014
developing greener software. The choice of

295
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,550
language again plays a very crucial

296
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:20,222
role. Whenever we use software, we think that

297
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:24,238
software do not contribute to carbon emission,

298
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,462
but they do. They do not do it directly,

299
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:32,626
but as they control the operations of the hard way.

300
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:36,386
Thus, they are indirectly contributing

301
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:39,862
in carbon emission. And in fact,

302
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:43,942
a research was done on different 27

303
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:47,634
different programming languages and it was

304
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:51,818
study how much electricity they consumed for ten

305
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:55,734
different problems. So a software

306
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:59,482
was built for solving ten different problems using 27

307
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:03,482
languages and it was studied how many much electricity

308
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:07,354
was consumed and the speed and memory usage

309
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:10,734
of each language. And it was

310
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:14,482
found out that still c comes out as

311
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:18,450
one of the best language in terms of energy efficiency.

312
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:24,222
AI models also contribute

313
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:28,102
in carbon emission as they

314
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:31,510
are creating and sharing reproducible code.

315
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,362
And it is also helping in developing

316
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:39,606
generative AI models which can be converted

317
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,090
together, integrated together to build greener coding solutions.

318
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,422
Now, in order to get a reliable software,

319
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:52,858
it is mass that that software is well tested,

320
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:57,642
but in the lens of carbon

321
00:20:57,786 --> 00:21:02,074
emission, the test cases that we execute,

322
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:05,746
they also emit carbon in the environment for

323
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,862
each of the test case being executed,

324
00:21:08,926 --> 00:21:12,386
as it requires cpus to be working

325
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:16,802
at extra times in order to run the test cases

326
00:21:16,946 --> 00:21:19,030
and generate reports.

327
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,202
So we need to build a clean testing

328
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:26,690
environment in order to save our environment.

329
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,086
Maybe we can use cloud virtualization techniques

330
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:33,462
for greener testing process. We can build smart

331
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,170
test selection processes.

332
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,606
Also, we should shift early the

333
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:44,190
testing process so that in order we get

334
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,694
the bugs early, it will

335
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:51,710
reduce the cost of running the test cases.

336
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,430
Companies are now building their own green business

337
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,926
model where there is a transformative shift

338
00:22:01,118 --> 00:22:04,954
upon circular economy as compared to the linear

339
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:08,738
economy which was followed earlier and asset

340
00:22:08,834 --> 00:22:12,406
upcycling. They are also making use

341
00:22:12,508 --> 00:22:15,798
of AI and ML driven energy

342
00:22:15,884 --> 00:22:19,414
analysis to build faster applications

343
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:23,002
which are more sustainable and which

344
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:26,886
can draw decisions in keeping energy efficiency

345
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:30,666
in mind. Now let's look at the principles

346
00:22:30,698 --> 00:22:34,586
that should be followed in order to build greener

347
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:39,390
solutions and become more and ecologically friendly.

348
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,742
Turn off facilities that are IoT needed so sleep

349
00:22:43,806 --> 00:22:48,020
scheduling can be employed in order to

350
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,482
make the sensors go off to sleep when

351
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:56,354
not needed. There are two types of sensors, active sensors

352
00:22:56,402 --> 00:23:00,054
and passive sensors. So these sensors can

353
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:04,710
be activated or they can be put on to sleep accordingly.

354
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,174
Send data that is needed predictive

355
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:12,780
data delivery definitely helps in

356
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,910
predicting which data is required, and faster

357
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,058
data delivery can be achieved without consuming

358
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:25,914
more energy. And IoT also helps in minimizing

359
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:29,598
the length of data path by employing different

360
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:32,738
smarter routing schemes. There should be

361
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,890
a trade off between processing for communication.

362
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,590
We should start using more greener communication technologies

363
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,410
and machine to machine communications.

364
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,482
We should bank upon more renewable green power sources

365
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:51,670
like solar energy, wind, thermal, et cetera,

366
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:57,154
as well as we should raise awareness on lowering

367
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:01,302
our energy usage by putting checkpoints,

368
00:24:01,446 --> 00:24:04,986
notifications, smart metering on the devices that

369
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:08,634
we are using. So now let's look

370
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:11,710
at what is the future of IoT.

371
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,718
As we can see, in future,

372
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:18,462
IoT will be integrating with

373
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:21,838
artificial intelligence to build more

374
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:25,586
intuitive and more smarter solutions. In fact,

375
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:29,534
IoT devices can be thought of as digital nervous

376
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:33,470
system, while AI IoT applications

377
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,200
function as the brain of a system.

378
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,270
AI has ingrained into our daily lives nowadays

379
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,202
and even very small devices

380
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:49,366
like glasses are now having artificial intelligence

381
00:24:49,478 --> 00:24:53,450
to build smarter vision into this. Other future

382
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,586
applications are green social network as

383
00:24:56,608 --> 00:25:00,002
a service unmanned aerial vehicles,

384
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:04,026
which can be used for machine to machine communications

385
00:25:04,138 --> 00:25:08,430
in drones, which can help in

386
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,722
energy efficient solutions

387
00:25:11,786 --> 00:25:16,642
by having lower flight time, gathering data by

388
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:20,766
lesser delay. Other applications are green connectivity

389
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:24,354
data and context aware applications as

390
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:27,830
well as nanodevices. Green social

391
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,554
network as a service can enhance the system's

392
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:34,882
energy efficiency, service provisioning

393
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:38,950
sensor networks, and cloud based wireless

394
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,766
sensor network management.

395
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:46,122
Now, these are the few points which

396
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:50,538
we can delve for future research for making IoT

397
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:54,062
more greener, more sustainability by

398
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:57,806
building energy harvesting techniques and

399
00:25:57,908 --> 00:25:59,630
low power chipsets.

400
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,222
More radio optimization techniques such as modulation,

401
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:07,922
optimization or cooperative communication can be

402
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:12,590
applied to reduce the power consumption of the nodes. Energy efficiency

403
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,530
routing techniques like cluster architectures

404
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:21,430
or multipath routing can provide efficient solutions.

405
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,542
Leading opinion makers think that the

406
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:28,922
future pattern of development will be

407
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:32,540
largely influenced by renewable sources of energy.

408
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,954
Some attach topmost priority to knowledge as

409
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:40,490
a source and innovation as a force.

410
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,302
With this, we come to an end of my

411
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:47,982
presentation, which I usually end by saying

412
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:51,534
this quotation that we should go green. As there is

413
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:56,562
no planet b, we all should put

414
00:26:56,696 --> 00:26:59,922
in our own bit, which will definitely

415
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:03,774
be small, but when looked at a larger

416
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,818
scale, cumulatively,

417
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:11,046
we all can definitely make an impact by

418
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:14,790
cautiously checking our everyday practices,

419
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,310
our everyday digital transactions,

420
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,430
which all are emitting some

421
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,494
amount of carbon and depleting our

422
00:27:27,692 --> 00:27:31,354
layer of Earth. So let's all join

423
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:35,370
hands in order to make this planet greener

424
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,622
and safer for our future generations to come.

425
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:41,760
Thank you. I'm available for any questions.

426
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,330
Thank you for the patient listening.
