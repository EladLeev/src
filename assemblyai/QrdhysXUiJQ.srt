00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,774
You the title of my

2
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,502
talk is taming the spatio temporal uncertainty in

3
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:36,246
observability. Distributed systems are complex and are

4
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:39,522
prone to failures. These failures often occur

5
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:43,622
due to unpredictability of production, system workload and

6
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:47,698
usage patterns in production, and the consequent emergent

7
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:51,002
runtime response of distributed systems,

8
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:54,222
which cannot be easily predictions during design,

9
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:57,934
observability and chaos. Engineering techniques are usually

10
00:00:58,052 --> 00:01:02,486
combined by conducting planned and thoughtful experiments

11
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:06,126
to uncover weaknesses in the system by analyzing

12
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:10,558
the runtime data of the system. Outcomes of observability

13
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:14,466
observability is a measure of how well the internal states of

14
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,066
a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external

15
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:21,830
outputs. In practice, however, observability must

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,402
enable us to accomplish two objectives.

17
00:01:24,546 --> 00:01:28,518
First is failure diagnosis, which is essentially inferring

18
00:01:28,534 --> 00:01:31,942
these cause from effects, and secondly failure

19
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,446
prognosis, which means enabling early warnings

20
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:39,254
of any impending failure based on current observed

21
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:43,402
behavior and projected failure pathways. So the objectives

22
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:47,018
of observability are prognosis and diagnosis.

23
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:50,362
So data must be interpretable and actionable.

24
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:53,582
Every tool promises more observability,

25
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:57,054
but often we see that more data and interactive

26
00:01:57,102 --> 00:02:00,862
dashboards leads to data deluge and decision

27
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:04,702
dilemma. The challenge is to digest massive quantities

28
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:08,370
of data to find patterns and correlate seemingly

29
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,182
unrelated events for performing prognosis and

30
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:15,810
prognosis. The challenges there are multiple challenges

31
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,974
in proactively discovering failure modes and performing diagnosis.

32
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:23,594
During these experiments. Logging and monitoring data

33
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:27,402
and their visualization from observability tools is

34
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,878
often too overwhelming and voluminous for them to

35
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,074
be actionable. There is very low signal to noise

36
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,794
ratio since many systems interact.

37
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:41,102
Semantic reconciliation and correlation of all that data is

38
00:02:41,156 --> 00:02:43,950
very difficult. Large volume of events,

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,998
determining and reuse of third party components

40
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:51,874
aggravate the challenge. While many may argue that more

41
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:55,622
the data these merrier in reality, however, the more

42
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,542
data you have, the less insights you can discover due to

43
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,494
noise and nondeterminism. This diagram gives

44
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:06,870
an idea of how one can take an integrated view

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,234
of prognosis and diagnosis. As you can see,

46
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:14,022
there is a fault or an anomaly at a particular instant.

47
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:17,962
Initially, the subsequent event pathways after this

48
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,774
event could take three possibilities. First, it could lead

49
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:25,294
to failure. Second, it's a transient fault and modes

50
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:29,246
not lead to any serious failure. Third, it's actually a

51
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:32,614
false alarms and really not a fault as originally

52
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:36,542
believed. As you can see, there is significant uncertainty

53
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:40,542
here. There is significant uncertainty in deciding to classify

54
00:03:40,606 --> 00:03:44,158
an observed behavior, an observed response behavior,

55
00:03:44,254 --> 00:03:47,986
as either normal or anomalous. Both false

56
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:51,526
positives and false negatives have impact during a

57
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:55,478
course of series of experiments. This uncertainty manifests itself

58
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:59,382
in both temporal and spatial dimensions. The earlier the decision

59
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:03,078
point in time before the actual expected failure,

60
00:04:03,174 --> 00:04:06,934
the more the possibility of false alarms and possible alert

61
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:10,986
fatigue, the later the decision point that is closer

62
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:14,602
to the expected failure in time, the less the usefulness

63
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:18,734
of the decisions, since it is most likely too late to

64
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,834
take action. Moreover, the longer the causal

65
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,266
chain, that is, the spatial separation of original cause

66
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:29,166
and its later effect, the more the uncertainty. In causal

67
00:04:29,198 --> 00:04:33,234
analysis, there is always confusion and uncertainty between

68
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:37,410
what is cause, what is correlation, what is consequence,

69
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,754
what is confounder, identifying coincidences

70
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:44,982
and what is association. There is always confusion between these

71
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:49,002
various aspects and concepts, often with huge amount

72
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,342
of observability data. These causal connections

73
00:04:52,406 --> 00:04:55,578
between various connected events are not very clear.

74
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:59,226
What chain of events led to the failure event? Often a

75
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:02,490
failure is never the result of a single chain of events,

76
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,366
it's a network. Multiple conditions lead to a failure event.

77
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:10,030
The causality challenge has been a classical one from

78
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,582
aristotelian times to now. It cannot be easily

79
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,150
solved and often this problem is underestimated.

80
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,638
There is an assumption that data analysis

81
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:24,322
can determine causality. This is far from true

82
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:28,690
in any prognosis and diagnosis process. There is uncertainty,

83
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,726
as we saw earlier in prognosis, the uncertainty that

84
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:36,534
given current state of these system, what pathways will the

85
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:40,274
system state traverse in time? Will it lead to failure

86
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:43,126
or a normal behavior? If it is going to fail,

87
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:46,758
where will it fail, which layer will fail, what component

88
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:50,154
and when is it likely to fail? But there is uncertainty in

89
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:53,470
space, the space here being architecture layer space,

90
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,974
and there is uncertainty in time as to when the failure will

91
00:05:57,012 --> 00:06:00,474
occur. For example, if there is a spike in cpu and memory

92
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:04,122
usage accompanied by other events, will that likely

93
00:06:04,186 --> 00:06:07,886
cause a failure of a service through a long causal chain

94
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,998
of connected events? If so, when and where will that occur?

95
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:15,866
Note this problem can be modeled as a spatiotemporalcausal

96
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,314
problem. We can draw inspirations from other disciplines

97
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:22,610
like city traffic modeling, weather modeling,

98
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,418
epidemiology, cancer treatment, and social networks.

99
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:30,710
For example, in cancer prognosis, one cloud do prognosis

100
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,914
as to where the source of cancer is,

101
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:37,562
how the metastatic pathways do take

102
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:41,450
place in the patient, and that's a spatiotemporalcausal

103
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,066
problem modeling. Similarly, other disciplines

104
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:49,370
like social networks, the problem is very similar in observability.

105
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,838
Spatiotemporalcausal data analysis is an emerging research area due

106
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:57,886
to the development and application of novel computational techniques,

107
00:06:57,998 --> 00:07:02,030
allowing for the analysis of large spatial temporal databases.

108
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,614
Spatial temporal models arise when data are collected

109
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:09,222
across time as well as space and has at least one

110
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:13,330
spatial and one temporal property. This is true for observability

111
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,366
data. Every data has a space, a property of space

112
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:21,462
and a property of time. Here is an approach we suggest

113
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:25,206
we provide a very high level approach these to taming the spatio

114
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:28,842
temporal causal uncertainty from system under normal conditions is

115
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:32,958
ingested into a spatiotemporalcausal database. The data

116
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:36,334
under fault injection condition is also ingested into

117
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,362
these database. The spatiotemporalcausal model consists of multiple

118
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:44,234
techniques using statistical techniques, time series

119
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:47,966
analyzing, association rules, data driven

120
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:51,662
predictions techniques, bayesian networks, pattern recognition,

121
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:55,334
Markov's model, cluster analysis, etc. All this

122
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:59,154
analysis is done in both time and space. In addition,

123
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:02,566
there is also a knowledge graph using discovery of

124
00:08:02,588 --> 00:08:06,418
semantic connections, what we call the qualitative reasoning

125
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:10,026
derived from text outputs like logs which are

126
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:13,814
very important for some kind of reasoning and causal chain

127
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:17,242
analyzing. Also, it is to be emphasized that it is

128
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:21,034
important not to aim at 100% automation

129
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:25,182
of prognosis and prognosis, but cause

130
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:28,990
these prognosis and diagnosis engine as

131
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,678
complementary to these human expertise. The engine provides

132
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:36,494
various recommendation to these human user like most likely fault

133
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:40,430
pathways, anomalous behavior alerts, imminent likely

134
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,694
failures, events, time to failure, hierarchical failures,

135
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:47,522
alarms, failures, recovery recommendations and event correlation.

136
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:50,774
As you can see, all these are recommendations that the

137
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:54,262
human expert cloud interact with and dig

138
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:58,310
deeper and explore further to enable better

139
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,314
prognosis or better diagnosis.

140
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:05,094
In summary, data deluge is a huge challenge in

141
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:08,946
observability. Integrated prognosis and diagnosis

142
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:12,526
should be the outcome of observability. The problem

143
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:16,670
here is modeled as spatio temporal causal

144
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,638
uncertainty predictions and in causal analysis. And last,

145
00:09:20,804 --> 00:09:24,766
machines should complement human expertise and not

146
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:28,442
replace and cannot replace human expertise

147
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:32,222
in conducting intelligent prognosis and

148
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:32,810
diagnosis.
