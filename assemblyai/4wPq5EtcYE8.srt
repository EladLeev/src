00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,866
Hi. Hello and welcome to the case study of building operations team

2
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:52,114
at Makolab. For last three years I effectively and

3
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:56,290
efficiently built area of DevOps operations, maintenancesupport and support

4
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,462
that delivers outcomes by going beyond the standard DevOps framework

5
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:03,874
with diverse competencies. Every day I'm going out

6
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:08,214
of the box. Extending classic DevOps approach in multidimensional

7
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,654
operations that boost up projects and deliver highest

8
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:15,146
quality. I'm from Wooch. Woodch is a very colorful city,

9
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:19,146
the center of Poland and in case that you will visit it,

10
00:02:19,248 --> 00:02:23,354
let me know. I can guide you through the main areas

11
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:27,306
that you should visit. Okay. My name is Grzegorz Sztandera

12
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:30,958
and for the last 20 years I'm working for the

13
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:34,734
banking and it industry. Twelve years for the project management

14
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:38,066
and also last few years, as I said,

15
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:42,030
building the DevOps area at Macula,

16
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,310
providing services for multiple industries.

17
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,034
Personally I like traveling to extraordinary

18
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:54,274
destinations like on the picture you can see me in front of the fourth

19
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:58,694
reactor of nuclear plant of Chernobyl in Ukraine and

20
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:02,558
also I'm working on the free shifts because I'm working at Makolab

21
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:06,262
and also I have two sons being creative

22
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:10,522
means. Also that I'm a painter for the board game Minifix

23
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:14,222
and recently I wrote a book stories for kids which is

24
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:17,866
in printing process right now. What is the pipeline

25
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,018
for our today presentation?

26
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:25,154
First I would like to highlight our

27
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:28,978
areas of expertise with our plugin approach of the operations team.

28
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:32,930
So you will see what we reached after two three years of building

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,770
that area. Then I will explain more about operations

30
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,546
team and I will cover multiple stages and aspects

31
00:03:40,658 --> 00:03:44,360
of building this team for the last few years.

32
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,198
Before the end and before the summary, I will present

33
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:52,026
few projects that we were taking part of on

34
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:55,654
a general layer and after that I will share a few takeaways

35
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,698
with you. The most important from my point of view, which was crucial

36
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:02,878
for this success story. Okay,

37
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:06,526
let's start DevOps up. Plugin approach what does it

38
00:04:06,548 --> 00:04:10,218
mean? We are in the middle of the ecosystem,

39
00:04:10,314 --> 00:04:14,306
so generally I will explain the plugin approach later. But we are

40
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:18,082
between the project developers, QAS and

41
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:21,906
project management and we are taking care of everything. What is needed for

42
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,330
the project does mean we are taking care of

43
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,710
test int e to e environments and also

44
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,998
supporting testing for the project. From the second

45
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:36,834
side we are supporting customer, third party

46
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:40,010
companies and end users taking care of everything

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,546
around us. 360 we are taking care

48
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:47,594
of environments including production, monitoring of the

49
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:51,246
environments. We are providing the whole scope of it

50
00:04:51,348 --> 00:04:54,990
services and maintenancesupport building

51
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,846
and delivering the CICD processes also

52
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:02,758
hypercur with extended productivity and predictive

53
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:06,500
maintenancesupport everything in the 24/7 manner of on call

54
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,946
and if possible and if we will have time, we are providing also

55
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:14,402
a lot of automation inside our

56
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:17,958
work. I can divide my team services

57
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:21,446
into three areas, as I said, Dev, Ops and sub.

58
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:25,414
So Dev, it's strictly connected with coding and

59
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:29,002
creating something. Ops in my

60
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:32,362
understanding means that we are operating what we did

61
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,154
create or what we receive to operate from the

62
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:39,714
customer with extended productivity, predictive maintenance

63
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:43,550
and so on. SAP refers mostly to itil

64
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,010
processes and standard support extended with deep

65
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,182
analysis of case within our team from

66
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:54,770
my perspective as an operations manager,

67
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,846
we are capable of creating any architecture and providing

68
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:03,154
the ideas for service architecture for the customer to

69
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:06,754
suit the customer needs. After that we are managing

70
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:10,214
it in example on production and after

71
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:14,054
delivering or having the application or

72
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:17,550
the product that is needed to be on production,

73
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,098
we can optimize and provide service optimization based

74
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:24,874
on our know how and our operations. For example from

75
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:28,330
the monitoring systems plugin approach,

76
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,238
the sample activity for plugin approach is just

77
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:35,454
in case of need. We are capable not only

78
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:40,046
to provide the full scope of DevOps operations, maintenance and support services,

79
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:43,826
but in case of need we can plug in into the project or into the

80
00:06:43,848 --> 00:06:47,854
customer environment, perform the tasks and then switch

81
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:51,060
off the sample of that is for example

82
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,454
building the automation with terraform for AWS

83
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,806
environments. We had a project where

84
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:02,294
customer asked us to look into

85
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:06,566
the manually created AWS environment for the product

86
00:07:06,748 --> 00:07:11,210
to optimize it and after that to create it using

87
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,154
terraform. So we were plugged into the project,

88
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:17,226
we provided the terraform scripts, run it,

89
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:20,826
deployed a new infrastructure and after that we

90
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:24,634
switched off from that specific project. This is the plugin approach

91
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:27,726
so we are not only providing the complex services but in case

92
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:31,182
of need. Like a wanting army, we can act and

93
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:34,954
provide the specific tasks that are needed

94
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:38,306
by the project or the customer. On the screen you

95
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:41,410
can see just the sample list of the activities that we can provide.

96
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,226
Also, we are multi cloud team, so we are capable

97
00:07:45,278 --> 00:07:48,930
of providing the solutions on for example AWS.

98
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,094
On azure environment we are the can in black,

99
00:07:53,212 --> 00:07:56,614
so we are available and we are providing the services during

100
00:07:56,652 --> 00:08:00,346
the day and the night. In case of needs. During the

101
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:04,102
day we are providing knowledge sharing with the project or we are participating

102
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:08,890
in the standard activities that project is having

103
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,846
in the scrum or agile methodology. So to

104
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:16,426
sum up, we are able to deliver the whole DevOps

105
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,078
classic approach, including development and QA based on other

106
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:23,946
Makolab teams. But we are involved in any of

107
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:27,634
those eight activities, as you can see on the screen, in a different

108
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:30,610
way of working in a different approach.

109
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,510
Now we will move to the building of my team.

110
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,454
When I came to Makolab three years ago, I had a team

111
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:41,894
of three persons and after a month two

112
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:45,202
of those free persons gives the resignation letter.

113
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:49,180
So at the very first month

114
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,314
of my potential of leading the team, I left with one

115
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:57,610
person having one project on production and

116
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,530
supporting in the full 24/7 manner.

117
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,862
So it was not the best

118
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:07,710
start. But as you can see on the chart,

119
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,886
based on the FT number of employees in the team,

120
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:17,234
it was rapidly growing. Between 2021 and 2022

121
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:20,786
I will focus on those two first years of building the team because right

122
00:09:20,808 --> 00:09:24,622
now it is quite stable and the competition are

123
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:28,098
growing and the projects are changing

124
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,634
so very fast. I was forced to deliver

125
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:35,574
additional engineers into the team. It was done by

126
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,974
adding a person by the both leasing,

127
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:43,046
not by direct hiring, but generally

128
00:09:43,238 --> 00:09:46,490
starting from 2021, we are permanently,

129
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,274
almost permanently looking for the new engineers

130
00:09:51,322 --> 00:09:55,358
to join the team. What brings it also

131
00:09:55,444 --> 00:09:59,102
so having 24/7 on production gives

132
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:02,478
the necessary on being on the permanent on call

133
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,714
for the first year of my existence in the team,

134
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:09,602
supporting the team for providing the highest quality of our

135
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,910
services based on the ITIL methodology.

136
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,560
So in the first year I did over 100

137
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,214
overtime hours per quarter. And also

138
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:26,070
the team as it was growing and the number of competencies both

139
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,074
combine with the number of work that

140
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:33,226
has to be done was rapidly growing. We had in

141
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:37,334
the first year around 1000 overtime

142
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:41,030
hours. In 2021, at the

143
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,094
end of 2022, we had ten people on board.

144
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:48,302
So from one to ten within two years, it was also

145
00:10:48,436 --> 00:10:52,642
combined with growing the competencies, growing the

146
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:56,882
number of projects which I will show you later,

147
00:10:57,016 --> 00:11:01,134
I was recruiting mostly junior and regular DevOps

148
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,270
engineers, each in different specialty.

149
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,274
While to be able to do all of the possible tasks,

150
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:12,040
as you can see on the screen, there are some

151
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,942
amount of daily tasks common for the whole team.

152
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,830
But case on the individual specialized

153
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:24,314
into different areas. Like one person was more

154
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:28,266
an expert in the databases, the second person was more the expert in

155
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,982
IT processes. I was able to very

156
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:35,422
fastly deliver the high quality for the

157
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:39,630
first project and other projects that was started

158
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,234
within the operations team at Makolab. What is

159
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:47,202
the advantages of having the junior regular team

160
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:51,086
on board with some areas of expertise they learned

161
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:54,814
from each other. So based on the person that is

162
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:58,920
specialized in databases, he didn't have the well

163
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,170
and deep knowledge about IT methodology.

164
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,694
So the person that is not knowing much about

165
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:10,826
databases is an expert for him because he

166
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:14,230
is an expert for the IT processes and opposite,

167
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,102
the person that was taking care of the IT processes

168
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:21,882
was saying that the database

169
00:12:21,946 --> 00:12:25,854
person is the expert for him. So the team was

170
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:30,638
and is constantly learning from each other and

171
00:12:30,724 --> 00:12:33,986
they are experts for each other and they are not in

172
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:38,274
the point that they do not see any possibility to grow

173
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:41,380
within the team and within the company.

174
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,506
Okay. I also have line manager who

175
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:49,462
is taking care of the HR processes. And this

176
00:12:49,516 --> 00:12:52,966
at the very beginning stage of my journey of building the

177
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:56,902
operations team at Makolab was very important to have such support.

178
00:12:56,956 --> 00:13:01,210
And also today having line manager

179
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,466
in the scope of the team is giving a

180
00:13:05,488 --> 00:13:09,020
boost for both technical and business

181
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,542
area. So generally the team evolved into having

182
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:18,282
competencies in sub areas and having the commitment

183
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:23,074
for the common tasks and providing the

184
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:26,782
proper quality. Also, what I want to highlight

185
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:29,300
that at the very beginning of creating this team,

186
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,238
and also even today I'm looking on the personality

187
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:37,618
even more than the technical skills,

188
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:41,286
because I believe that we can learn everything, but we are not

189
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:45,286
able to change our attitude as fast as

190
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:49,206
we can learn the new technologies.

191
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:53,020
So that was the time of building the team. It was

192
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:57,354
quite interesting and I really love the time with

193
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:01,706
the retrospection from today, a lot of work, a lot of challenges,

194
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:06,762
which gave at the end a lot of positive

195
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:10,842
effects. Going further to the overview,

196
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:14,530
you can just see the number of deployment

197
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,286
releases, because deployment was releasing

198
00:14:18,318 --> 00:14:21,330
one of the projects due to some security reasons,

199
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,826
we were not aligned with the standard DevOps approach.

200
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:29,686
But what is important in this chart that you

201
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,042
can see how fast we were growing with the number of tasks.

202
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:37,542
And it is also showing

203
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:41,302
how we were expanding our competencies,

204
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:44,906
team and projects within the first year

205
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:48,182
of building this team in Makolab.

206
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:51,742
So I was looking for multiple data

207
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:56,366
that I will be able to show you. This is presenting the best the

208
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,954
whole scope of growing,

209
00:14:59,002 --> 00:15:02,462
expanding and building the team based

210
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:06,434
on the sample data from the deployment releases from

211
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:10,434
one of the projects. Also, as you

212
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,698
are able to see on the previous slides, there was a lot of work

213
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:17,400
for the certifications. Just to confirm that

214
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:22,822
we have the competencies and

215
00:15:22,876 --> 00:15:26,086
how the team was built. First I was providing an

216
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:29,418
onboarding. It took three months for every single person.

217
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:33,402
And after some time we discovered that the best person

218
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:37,146
that will be providing the onboarding for the new joiner will

219
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:40,286
be the person that was recently joining our team.

220
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:44,954
Because that person has the best overview

221
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:48,702
for the onboarding process. It was very effectively and also was

222
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:53,090
able to integrate the new person to the whole team based on

223
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,674
daily connections, not only with the team,

224
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:00,626
but deep connection with the last onboarded person. So it

225
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:03,940
was very smooth to join the team and also to join the

226
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,680
tasks and competencies. After some time

227
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,294
at Macolab there was a decision to run a bootcamp program.

228
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:18,986
First it was for the Java, but after some time the

229
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:22,890
decision was also to start it for the DevOps area,

230
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,820
for the operations team. So we started that.

231
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,554
It is also the three months program that we can hire

232
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:33,866
juniors or even persons that were not familiar

233
00:16:33,898 --> 00:16:38,000
with DevOps activities before. And ensuring those three months

234
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,810
we are teaching those persons in area of

235
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,730
AWS, terraform Jenkins and it

236
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,294
processes. And after that that person can join

237
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:55,698
very smoothly the team and start working on the real production

238
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:58,742
environment. As I already said,

239
00:16:58,796 --> 00:17:02,178
personality was more important than technical skills.

240
00:17:02,274 --> 00:17:06,680
And also for the team, a lot of trainings and certifications were

241
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,786
provided. So how to integrate the remote team? This is

242
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:15,260
when it's creating. I joined during the pandemic for

243
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,530
building this team. The first was

244
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,786
that all of the calls are with cameras on and there is no excuse

245
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,822
for that. We work on a daily basis with each other.

246
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:31,694
So we are not looking how someone is looking on the very

247
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:35,102
specific day. We want just to see each other and see the emotions

248
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:39,234
and be able to integrate more. Also after

249
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:43,634
a few months I decided to have one on one outside the

250
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:47,720
company area and discuss how the team is growing and

251
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,526
what is the perception of the engineers about

252
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:55,878
the team. And it also gives me a

253
00:17:55,964 --> 00:17:59,418
very big boost in the possibility to understand

254
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:03,082
exactly what was going during that

255
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:08,010
time. After that we are joining during

256
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,646
the weekends, we are going to one of the cities in

257
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:14,926
Poland and we are spending time together

258
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:18,458
just to integrate more than only on the remote.

259
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:22,946
If possible, I'm also available at the office. And from

260
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:26,274
time to time someone is just joining the

261
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:29,362
office to have at least few minutes of talk,

262
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:33,410
even if I'm overwhelmed with the

263
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,374
meetings, which I will also present later. So I

264
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:42,326
building the team that feels the responsibility of

265
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:45,686
the tasks of the common tasks, that those are not the

266
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,146
tasks of the company, but tasks of the

267
00:18:49,168 --> 00:18:53,494
team. And everyone is responding

268
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:57,082
for delivering the high quality. And also we have

269
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,034
a trust for each other inside the

270
00:19:01,072 --> 00:19:04,638
team. What is not obvious,

271
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:07,722
but also very important risk management.

272
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:11,246
So from the very beginning also this is the culture of

273
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:15,810
Makolab, of having the strong risk management processes.

274
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,090
I was identifying and managing the risks,

275
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,314
which I can say that 20% of the risks are

276
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:27,142
connected with people, 50% were connected with quality

277
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:31,206
and 30% with the customer or the competencies that at

278
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:34,486
that time we didn't have in the team.

279
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:38,054
So this process is quite critical for delivering

280
00:19:38,182 --> 00:19:41,500
the high quality and being able to scale up

281
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,930
very quickly. From my management point of view,

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,846
what I did to also have

283
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,594
the team working together in the close knit

284
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:57,134
manner. I provided some logo type for our team

285
00:19:57,172 --> 00:20:00,718
and also t shirts and some other gifts for the team.

286
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:04,338
So for understanding that we are a

287
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:07,790
team, we have something in common. And also I was promoting

288
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,506
on the webinars internal webinars competencies and

289
00:20:11,528 --> 00:20:15,218
the team inside the company to let everyone know

290
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:19,186
that there is something going on in this area and we are growing

291
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,758
with the competencies multitasking. I will present on the

292
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:28,614
next screen the sample week of my calendar. But all

293
00:20:28,652 --> 00:20:32,666
of the work for building the team brings me to

294
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:36,742
the time that I have six or even sometimes seven meetings

295
00:20:36,806 --> 00:20:39,934
in parallel. So I was able to take two, one of

296
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:43,066
laptop and one of mobile.

297
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,926
There was an issue, I was able to listen to them both in

298
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:50,480
parallel, but if someone asked me to

299
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,074
speak something, it was quite difficult for having those

300
00:20:55,112 --> 00:20:58,994
two meetings. I work under it and right now

301
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:02,546
I delegate some of the tasks to my team and

302
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:06,146
also optimize the

303
00:21:06,248 --> 00:21:09,774
calendar on my side. From the internal development.

304
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:14,414
Before I joined the team, I completed MBA

305
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:18,490
studies and also it project management studies. And during

306
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,570
the first both months I did personally

307
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,210
quite a number of cloud and related certifications. And also after

308
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,870
that the whole team was certified with the ITIL

309
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,174
version four. From the external development I am

310
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:37,694
talking for example to you about how the team was built up.

311
00:21:37,732 --> 00:21:41,566
And also in 2023 I

312
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:45,970
was presenting a lot of talks on multiple conferences in Poland

313
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,930
and across Europe.

314
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,834
I built the process knowledge base and

315
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:56,518
competencies inside the team. So we have the training

316
00:21:56,604 --> 00:22:00,200
program, the bootcamp program and also

317
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,574
multiple documentations like the tasks list,

318
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:08,518
emergency procedures, first aid kits,

319
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,374
FTE reports and so on and so on. So generally

320
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:15,754
based on the growing of the team, there was a need for

321
00:22:15,872 --> 00:22:20,140
having more and more data combined to

322
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,946
having the information about how the team is growing,

323
00:22:23,978 --> 00:22:27,150
how the team is delivering and

324
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,782
what we can offer for our existing and new

325
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,810
customers. So also some acquisition,

326
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,410
negotiations or transition of the processes,

327
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,742
providing the information that hello, we are the operations

328
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:45,510
team and we can deliver some added value for your projects.

329
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,294
And it really gives us the boost in the number of projects for

330
00:22:50,332 --> 00:22:56,486
the recently 2021 and 2022.

331
00:22:56,588 --> 00:23:01,260
What is also important, based on the IT report

332
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,570
from ITMT in Poland,

333
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,254
they are dividing the leaders into four groups, people leader,

334
00:23:09,302 --> 00:23:12,670
business leader, technical leader and additional leaders,

335
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,246
corporate architect. So I believe that

336
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:20,734
what helps me most was that and I

337
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:24,914
am more the people leader then I'm looking also on the business area

338
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,674
and also due to the fact that there is no much time

339
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:32,370
for that, I just delegate the

340
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,762
leading, the technical part for the team. And I believe

341
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:39,254
that they are specialists, there are engineers and they know what they

342
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:44,114
do. I need to provide them the right environment

343
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:48,374
for delivering the outcomes. Okay, I said

344
00:23:48,412 --> 00:23:52,074
that I will show you my sample calendar. So one

345
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:55,626
or one and a half year ago it was looking like

346
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,146
this. So there was no much time for me

347
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:02,880
to work. I changed it, I moved some competencies to the team and also

348
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,066
then I was able to take some responsibilities.

349
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:11,290
So it was really demanding time at the very beginning

350
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,814
to make it working, to build it, to make it efficient

351
00:24:14,942 --> 00:24:18,818
and to integrate the whole team together.

352
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:22,466
How I can see the future. So right now we

353
00:24:22,488 --> 00:24:26,198
have one manager with assistance of line manager and we

354
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,726
have a team of engineers. In the future,

355
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:32,630
when the number of project and variety of competencies

356
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,710
will grow, it will lead us to

357
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,602
extract two competencies areas within one team and

358
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:44,362
deliver separately the IT processes within

359
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,754
one team and the DevOps processes within the

360
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:52,378
second team. If there will be growth

361
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:56,174
above, for example, 20 to 30 people, there will be

362
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:59,662
also the third team. The operations which now in this plan

363
00:24:59,716 --> 00:25:03,534
is combine between the ITIL and DevOps

364
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:07,570
teams on a different technical layer.

365
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,020
What about the project? So we started with one customer and one project.

366
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,694
We received the feedback that we are the first company that was

367
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:21,030
taking care and was correcting 100% of the issues

368
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,934
founded on production. Also under

369
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:29,378
cooperation with developers, they start asking us for the help

370
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:33,082
that they usually should receive from the corporate IT

371
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:36,266
area. But they were so used to receive support from us.

372
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:40,220
So even with those tasks that were coming to us and

373
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,606
being honest with the customer is also very important.

374
00:25:44,788 --> 00:25:48,158
So if we find the bug, we inform the customer.

375
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:51,626
If we find vulnerability on production that is not in our scope,

376
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:55,074
we also inform the customer. And based on our

377
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:58,514
competencies, we can advise other teams and say

378
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:02,366
them what to improve. So this approach and this high quality leads

379
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:06,054
us from one customer and one project starting 2021,

380
00:26:06,092 --> 00:26:09,234
to seven customers and twelve projects overall,

381
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:15,206
eight running at the end on 2022.

382
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:19,880
Also within the five tier, we provide

383
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,314
the team and competencies give

384
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:28,074
us the possibility to double the revenue from

385
00:26:28,112 --> 00:26:31,858
the first project. And within two years, the overall

386
00:26:31,974 --> 00:26:35,630
income for the operations team was

387
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,006
tripled. I am not revealing the numbers from 2023,

388
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:42,830
because it is not ended, but we can discuss it and hopefully

389
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,482
next year I will be able also to show this area

390
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:50,706
some statistics from one of the products that

391
00:26:50,808 --> 00:26:54,686
we are running. Those statistics are from the

392
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:58,546
two years period. So weekly inside the applications

393
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:02,310
we are taking care of 200,000 processes

394
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,678
and during those two years we provide over 500

395
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:10,730
deployments. So it means that every single working

396
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,666
day in average growth and deployment based

397
00:27:14,688 --> 00:27:18,538
on our productivity. Because we are also looking

398
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:22,078
into the logs, the operations team,

399
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:26,106
without any incident from production,

400
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:29,934
was able to identify over front hundreds defects that

401
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:33,694
the end customers end users were not

402
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:37,822
able to see. And we were able to fix it before

403
00:27:37,876 --> 00:27:41,186
being hit by the critical incident of production or something like

404
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,846
that. During that time we received over 1000 incidents and

405
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:49,480
our SLA for delivering the solution was over 99.5%.

406
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,322
And also as we were working in a quite complex

407
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,870
environment with multiple other companies and applications connected

408
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,594
to us, we did create over 600

409
00:28:01,632 --> 00:28:05,526
incidents to other teams. And unfortunately the SLA

410
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,242
was not as good as ours because it was around 95%.

411
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:13,614
So usually we were struggling with the issues, sometimes that

412
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:16,814
were not our fault and we were hited by other

413
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:20,458
teams failures. On production.

414
00:28:20,554 --> 00:28:24,046
We also provided the independent monitoring of application on production,

415
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:28,260
which brings us the possibility of having

416
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,354
faster notification of possible errors, because from

417
00:28:32,392 --> 00:28:36,820
the customer side we're alarmed after ten or 15 minutes of

418
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,854
having some issues. For example on production, based on our

419
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,486
own monitoring of this application, we are able to identify the

420
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:47,914
issue after 1 minute and start working to provide the

421
00:28:47,952 --> 00:28:51,322
resolution. Okay, that's all. Regarding the building

422
00:28:51,376 --> 00:28:55,014
of operations team, right now I will quickly switch

423
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:58,662
to the sample projects

424
00:28:58,726 --> 00:29:02,554
that we are or were running for the customers. So one

425
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,574
of these is service event assistant. I will not go deeply into what

426
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:10,026
the applications was doing because from the DevOps,

427
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:14,146
operations, maintenance and support, it is important to make the application

428
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:17,874
operational and understand what the application is

429
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:21,842
doing. But generally the business case is not always the most important part

430
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:25,794
for having it maintenance on production.

431
00:29:25,842 --> 00:29:29,474
So for this project we provided the whole CI CD

432
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:32,466
processes, including deployment of those processes,

433
00:29:32,578 --> 00:29:35,926
everything in 24/7 maintenancesupport and support on

434
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,854
call model. It was based on AWS.

435
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:43,770
We provided a lot of monitoring. For example Kibana Grafana Dynatrace

436
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:48,474
and we are analyzing locks, including for example 1

437
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:52,286
million locks per week. Based on

438
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:55,866
that, as I said, if we see any possibility to automate

439
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:59,930
our work, we are providing automation with terraform and symbol

440
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,822
cloud formation, but also scripting in bash or python

441
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:07,618
if the tasks is possible to be done

442
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:11,774
automatically. The next one from the aviation regarding

443
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:15,906
the applications, which were the flight components

444
00:30:15,938 --> 00:30:19,862
with the whole ecosystem of for example communication between the

445
00:30:19,996 --> 00:30:23,874
ground and aircraft, Macaulay provided the whole development

446
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:27,930
into scrum agile methodology, including quality

447
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,110
assurance, UX and project management.

448
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,506
We as can operation team. We are

449
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:38,346
providing 24/7 maintenance and support in a call model

450
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:42,494
and also expanding the monitoring, for example using data docker or

451
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:46,430
using new relic with log analysis and also

452
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,826
incident management based on the IT processes.

453
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,974
The last sample that I have for you today is from the health industry.

454
00:30:55,102 --> 00:30:59,246
And here based on AWS and based on cloudformation,

455
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,974
we did provide the full DevOps engagement,

456
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:06,962
which brings us to the situation that we are building

457
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:09,846
the environment from the very beginning. First,

458
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:13,590
because it was important to deliver it quickly,

459
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,174
so it was manually. Then we provided the cloud formation for

460
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:21,242
building the whole ecosystem and expand for the new customers. And after

461
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:24,842
that when there was some time for looking

462
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:28,458
deeper into what was needed

463
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:32,810
exactly for specific customers, we started cloud cost optimization

464
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,742
process which can bring to lower

465
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:41,150
the invoices with a really

466
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,820
huge number, even over 50%

467
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,050
after that time of optimization.

468
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,146
Okay, going to the summary, I want to share with you

469
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:56,422
some takeaways. The most important things

470
00:31:56,476 --> 00:31:59,766
that I believe drives us to the point that

471
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:02,834
we are and being able to rapidly

472
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:06,454
expand the operations team within the company and within new

473
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:10,090
projects, new competencies and new team members.

474
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,866
So the personality at the very beginning, in the

475
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:17,462
long term is more important for the team success than technical

476
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:20,586
level. If you need something to be done right now,

477
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,938
today, and you don't have time for building the competencies,

478
00:32:25,034 --> 00:32:28,334
you should hire a senior person that is an expert in this

479
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,974
area. But if you are building something and want to make it stable,

480
00:32:32,122 --> 00:32:36,386
it is in my perception better to give

481
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:40,020
people the space for learning

482
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,386
and take to the team the persons that will bring the

483
00:32:44,408 --> 00:32:47,954
same, maybe not personality, but the same

484
00:32:47,992 --> 00:32:51,606
level of understanding why we are here, what we want to do

485
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,960
and where we want to be in the future.

486
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,378
Small teams of course are more flexible and are being

487
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:01,820
more able to be integrated and working closely together.

488
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,634
And as I said, the role of line manager and the team leader can

489
00:33:06,672 --> 00:33:10,910
be like an intersection. And generally

490
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,846
I really love working with the line manager right now and in the

491
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:19,440
very beginning because it boosts up the possibility of

492
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,834
expanding the team as now at the end,

493
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:27,682
for the customer we can be one man army, but inside

494
00:33:27,816 --> 00:33:31,246
we are not one man but one team army.

495
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:35,566
And we are working together to deliver the results

496
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:39,606
for the customer, for the company and for the team. And we should understand that,

497
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:43,026
that we are not an individuals that are making individual tasks,

498
00:33:43,138 --> 00:33:46,162
but those individual tasks are combining

499
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:50,058
into some common added value that we can share with the customer

500
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:53,914
and bring it and build and

501
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:57,530
expand the cooperation with the customers.

502
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,390
I always trying to give my team the broad context on the business,

503
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,046
operational and other layers if possible, because the better

504
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:09,486
we understand what is behind the task that we have

505
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:13,054
to do, the better we are able to deliver it.

506
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,338
So it improves quality and it is really working. So at

507
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:19,426
the end, if you are building such a team, I will say

508
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:23,106
that be more people leader than technical or business leader at

509
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:25,990
the very beginning to build the common goal,

510
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,590
to build the common sense of being together

511
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,854
and working and delivering the tasks. And I think

512
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:38,966
it will work not only in the DevOps operations area but also in

513
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:42,686
multiple other teams, not necessarily

514
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:45,334
in the IT industry.

515
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:49,610
Okay, if you have any questions or you are in any stage of

516
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,590
presented projects, you can contact me anytime.

517
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,718
When everything around is on fire, it is sometimes

518
00:34:56,804 --> 00:35:00,606
good not only not to extinguish a fire, but to

519
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:04,466
grab a coffee and have a short discussion because it can bring us to

520
00:35:04,488 --> 00:35:08,514
the good conclusion and we will be able to move

521
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:12,062
the things and deliver

522
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:15,586
something better than just the fire around us. So you

523
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:19,762
can join me on LinkedIn and if needed

524
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:23,570
I will give you assistance with your
