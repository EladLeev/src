1
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:21,802
All right, so we are here to talk about Pachamama,

2
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:26,006
the planet, modern nature and how as a develop or

3
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:29,110
as human bring. You should care about it. I consider

4
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,566
myself as a political activist with a h because I'm a developer as well

5
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:35,106
as I will tell you in a second, my name is Manuel Carrasco Molina.

6
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:38,994
On the Internet I go under blip.org

7
00:00:39,042 --> 00:00:42,854
is so blip means stays in German. It's my journalist

8
00:00:42,902 --> 00:00:46,426
activity following the environmental movements. I like to

9
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:50,266
play around with final cut pro and logic pro and try

10
00:00:50,288 --> 00:00:53,822
to do some hopefully good video. I'm a

11
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:57,646
french speaking spanish guy, born in Belgium, which has been living in

12
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:01,434
Germany for the last 18 years. We see. Yeah, I basically love Europe,

13
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:05,214
except for the way they treat refugees at the border. I'm not 24 years

14
00:01:05,252 --> 00:01:09,374
old, I wish, but I am a dinosaur in this environment

15
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:13,326
of developers because I've been developer for 24 years, developing for the iPhone

16
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:16,786
since 2008. But I like way more than nature. So this is why

17
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:19,934
I'm pretty critical at Apple when it comes to environmental aspects.

18
00:01:19,982 --> 00:01:23,382
Ten years active with the Green party, four years in the city council near

19
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:26,774
a city that I will show you where there is a big coal pit called

20
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:30,294
captain. We moved three years ago, we bought a new house, and so

21
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:33,802
now I am since last year again involved in the city

22
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:37,494
council, but this time also in the regional council. And I hope that my political

23
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:40,746
career will go further on just for the sake of protecting the environment.

24
00:01:40,778 --> 00:01:44,554
Considering myself a climate activist and also refugees activist,

25
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:47,642
I do this mix of politics, activism,

26
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:51,070
journalism, free journalism, reporting on the field,

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,260
being with the real activists, I would say.

28
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,622
But I see myself as part of the global solution,

29
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:02,002
being just hopefully a tiny part of it.

30
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:06,946
Eight years without any meat. I wrote a book on APIs called

31
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,654
Karma based API on Apple platforms. It's about building privacy into iOS

32
00:02:10,702 --> 00:02:14,118
and OS apps. If you take a picture of this

33
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:17,334
QR code and you will make a tweet that you like the book,

34
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:20,726
even though you haven't read it yet. And I will pick the three first ones

35
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:23,786
that are retweeting this thing and all the others. I hope you can help me

36
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:27,466
spread the good message about our privacy is an important thing.

37
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:31,162
I gave talks about privacy also at different conferences. You can find

38
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:35,134
it online. Let's look at the mass, as I call

39
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:38,430
it. This is what we always refer as like the base point.

40
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,078
Obviously since were industrialized, we've fixed a

41
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:45,694
couple of problems. We have less poverty than we used to have. It also

42
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:49,186
means that growth comes with a few problems. As you can see by this

43
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:53,090
curve, it goes all the way to the top. And we are right now about

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,494
1.2 degrees. This is why every time you hear 1.5 degrees,

45
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:00,290
which is the goal, we have to reach it, actually, because if we dont,

46
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,566
we will be in a big mess, especially people in the global south. In this

47
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:07,462
talk, I will play a couple of videos. The next one is from ITV News.

48
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:10,406
Let's go into it and let's face the truth, truth,

49
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:14,646
truth. Scientists say that since 1970, temperatures have risen

50
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:18,522
faster than in any other 50 year period over the past 2000

51
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,994
years. They fear that a target of keeping warming

52
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:25,870
below one dont five degrees will now be breached within 20

53
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,778
years unless there is immediate,

54
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:32,662
rapid and large scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

55
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,740
So this is what we have to do together.

56
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,486
Immediate, rapid and large scale reductions.

57
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,946
So as an

58
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:46,974
industry, as developers, as ceos or whatever, we can be responsible

59
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:50,710
for large scale reddictions. The socalled obviously depends

60
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,662
if you are whatever, the CEO of Facebook or

61
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:58,790
if you have just an app which three people have downloaded.

62
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,626
But every one of us can do something at this scale, and also every one

63
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:06,794
of us can do something personally. So this is why this talk is also

64
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:10,602
about, not only about you as a developer, but also you as a human

65
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:13,694
being. One of the things that I do since many, many years is I go

66
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:17,082
with my camera, with microphone and whatnot,

67
00:04:17,146 --> 00:04:20,446
call the years that are necessary to do, to produce those kind of

68
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,866
videos. Some people that I know are going with drones,

69
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:27,614
for example, and we follow the people that are

70
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,350
doing basically civil disobedience.

71
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:34,966
Thank.

72
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:49,350
It's happy.

73
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:57,590
That's.

74
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,440
Thank you.

75
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,854
All right, so the video goes for another, like, in total for 14

76
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:21,650
minutes. So check it out if you, if you'd like. And basically,

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,526
they were fighting against the next problem, so to

78
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:28,962
say, which is gas, and generally lng,

79
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:32,290
which is the liquid gas imported from the global source,

80
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,034
from parts like Argentina, from Vacamuerta,

81
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:39,482
for example, where basically indigenous people are

82
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:43,610
endangered. Another thing that is more like

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,066
the current problem, but which is hopefully starting to be fixed and

84
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:51,066
being phased out, is lignite. So it's bronchial, as we

85
00:05:51,088 --> 00:05:52,410
call it in German.

86
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,034
A big chunk of Germany is filled with those holes,

87
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:02,606
which I explain you a little bit on the right. And this

88
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,494
is the biggest polluter in Germany, which is just a couple of kilometers

89
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:10,402
away from where I live. And it produced every year as much co2

90
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:14,078
as New Zealand. So as you can tell. So I'll

91
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:17,462
show you in this map over there. If you go somewhere over there,

92
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:21,240
it's very tiny. But if you look it up on Apple Mac, for example,

93
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,786
this thing is actually where the image

94
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:28,120
on the left is. And this other thing

95
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,618
over there, this huge thing, is actually the could

96
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:37,334
pit. It's actually as big as cologne itself. And you might recognize

97
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:40,602
that over there it says Hamburg forest.

98
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:43,882
So it's the forest which has been decimated

99
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,982
for the last 40 years. And hopefully, luckily, all the

100
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,110
activism together and a little bit of political work and whatnot

101
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,822
could stop this madness.

102
00:06:55,886 --> 00:07:00,146
So this part you see is still there, but because

103
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:03,474
there are lots of problem with water not being there,

104
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:07,334
where it should be, nobody knows if the trees will

105
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:11,222
actually survive. All right, let's move on a little bit and speak about another

106
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:14,600
way of activism. It's about moving to a plant based food.

107
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,302
And I show you another small video,

108
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,794
which is called in 20 to 30 years. So it's a video from five years

109
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:26,326
old. So that's why I call it in 25 years, the world would be mostly

110
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:29,942
vegan. So you could technically start today by at least reducing meat.

111
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm not asking anybody to start today to be young vegan myself.

112
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,606
It took me two years after my father was

113
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:42,986
ill from cancer, to start reading about it and understanding the problematics

114
00:07:43,018 --> 00:07:46,690
around cancer and what food had to do with it and whatnot.

115
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,774
And then after two years of reducing meat, I became a pescatarian,

116
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:55,074
which is basically only eating fish. And then

117
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:58,582
after three months, I became a vegetarian. And for little

118
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,974
under three months than three years. Sorry. And then I became a vegan five years

119
00:08:02,012 --> 00:08:05,190
ago. Animal agriculture contributes 51%

120
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,322
of total global greenhouse gas emissions. It's responsible for

121
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:13,034
91% of Amazon deforestation, and one

122
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:16,506
to two new acres are cleared every second.

123
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:19,818
One third of all freshwater globally is used by the

124
00:08:19,824 --> 00:08:23,834
meat and dairy industry. A vegan can be fed on just one 16th

125
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:27,610
of an acre of land for a year. A meat eater needs 18

126
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,246
times that much land. Waste and pollution from animal farms are

127
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:34,942
an environmental catastrophe. This is why you can call us crazy

128
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:37,874
and you can think like, oh no, I'm not going to stop on meat because

129
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:41,154
this is so tasteful. And whatever. The fact is that at one point

130
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:44,850
or another, it won't be possible anymore to eat as much meat as we do,

131
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,738
for obvious ecological reasons. And if you think politics will solve

132
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:52,134
the problem, it can. In some ways, at my level,

133
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:55,800
I'm trying to fix some stuff, but not only

134
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,054
in terms of food. I'm also bring to have lets space for cars and more

135
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:03,290
space for bikes, for example. At the more local

136
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,938
level, right now in Germany, the greens with the socialists and

137
00:09:06,944 --> 00:09:10,906
the liberals are trying to bring Germany on the target of 1.5 degrees.

138
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:14,814
We are trying to phase out coal by 2030

139
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,990
without making nuclear longer because

140
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,606
nuclear station power will be phased out next year

141
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:26,350
in Germany. I'm happy to speak about terrium and all those kind of stuff,

142
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,586
but I just think this is not the solution. And so in

143
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:33,266
some ways it can. But if you think about the cups, we had

144
00:09:33,288 --> 00:09:36,614
26 of this and I just don't trust it. I don't trust

145
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:39,894
it because as Greta was mentioning, this is a lot

146
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:43,142
of blah blah blah, build back

147
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:45,986
better blah blah blah, green economy,

148
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:49,814
blah blah blah, net zero by 2050, blah blah blah

149
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:53,126
net zero, blah blah blah, climate neutral blah blah

150
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:56,442
blah. Our hopes and dreams drown in their

151
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,326
empty words and promises. They've now had 30 years of blah

152
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:03,914
blah blah. And where has that led us? Over 50% of all

153
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:07,310
our co2 emissions have occurred since 1990 and a third

154
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,794
since 2005. If this is what they consider to be climate

155
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:15,006
action, then we don't want it. They invite cherry picked young people

156
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:18,194
to meetings like this to pretend that they are listening to us,

157
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:21,426
but they are clearly not listening to us, and they

158
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:24,786
never have. Just look at the numbers, look at the numbers, look at the

159
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:28,326
facts. And most of those world leaders aren't listening to

160
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:31,906
us. So one way to solve the problem is we will solve

161
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:35,574
the problem. It takes some of us to go into politics, which is

162
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:38,982
not always easy, believe me, in the way,

163
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:42,438
I am pretty radical. So I have to do some compromises, which I don't

164
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:46,700
really like a lot, but it takes of us to do some civil disobedience to.

165
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,954
Look, if it wasn't for the activists in the Hamba forest since

166
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:54,234
2012, we wouldn't be speaking about phasing out coal

167
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:57,982
by 2030 in Germany. Actually, up until three years ago,

168
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,310
the discussion was still 2045,

169
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,500
so we were going to phase out coal in 2045.

170
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,346
Let's try to fix this together. And speaking of problems,

171
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:14,946
there is this tiny it problem. It's like kind of the

172
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:18,402
elephant in the room. You can imagine we are generating a lot of co2.

173
00:11:18,456 --> 00:11:20,726
There are a lot of things to fix, and can we fix it together?

174
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:23,446
So let's try to fix it together. I give you a few tips. One of

175
00:11:23,468 --> 00:11:26,966
it is a search engine. We search all day long,

176
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:31,046
right? We go like, oh, how do I convert a swift ui

177
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:35,206
font to can ui font? Yeah, go for it on Stackervoplo

178
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:39,194
and you'll find out it's a terrible enum thingy and

179
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,842
then oh my Ruby version is not found. So my fast lane isn't working

180
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:45,966
anymore. Or am I going to fix it? And how many engineers does it take

181
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:49,246
to save the world? Well I dont know, probably not

182
00:11:49,268 --> 00:11:52,366
too many but at the same time a lot. So you get

183
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:55,598
it right. We are constantly looking it up.

184
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:59,282
And when I'm saying searching, looking it up you're probably thinking of a word

185
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,766
in your mind. And this is my question to you. Are you still googling?

186
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:05,858
You want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or do you

187
00:12:05,864 --> 00:12:08,438
want to come with me and change the world? Come with me and change the

188
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,750
world and stop searching and start planting, right. Stop using Google,

189
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,406
use Ecosia. Some of you might know them.

190
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:18,294
Ecosia.org, it's a german company which

191
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:21,782
is being founded by this guy Christian Krell. As this

192
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:25,082
german newspaper was saying, he prefers to plant trees instead

193
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:28,694
of making millions. So what they do is you search the web with Ecosia

194
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:32,074
and by the way they are based on bing, so the algorithm is not too

195
00:12:32,112 --> 00:12:35,598
bad. And if by any means you dont find what you find

196
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:38,814
over there, you just click on another link and then you go to google just

197
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:42,190
in case. Google is better, they generate money with ads just like

198
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,386
Google does or bring does or whatever everybody does. But the

199
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:49,874
difference is they do it with good ads. So by good I means

200
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:53,806
they will never put you an ad for fossil

201
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:58,146
fuels or for flying from Hamburg

202
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:01,574
to Berlin for example. And they do some money

203
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:05,410
out of it. And once they get the revenues,

204
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,586
like the pure revenues, 80% of it, they use it to plant trees with partners.

205
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:13,482
So it means they pay their people, they pay

206
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:16,890
their computers, they pay their servers or whatever. And the money they still have,

207
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,250
they use 20% of it to make the company a little bit

208
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,374
richer, so to say, so that the company can grow a little bit, but 80%

209
00:13:23,412 --> 00:13:27,246
of it, they just plant trees. Tune your code. And if

210
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:30,734
you think, or if you thought that this

211
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:34,270
talk was going to be only about this, then you were obviously wrong.

212
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,254
I give a talk about this at least at iOS devs UK,

213
00:13:38,302 --> 00:13:41,758
but I think at other conferences as well, which is about optimizing

214
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:45,346
your code. This is very specific in this case to

215
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:49,574
basically Xcode and iOS, which is the tool in which you

216
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:53,522
guys watching this video are commonly

217
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,934
using. One thing you can do over there is you can use the gadgets and

218
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:59,740
see basically what's the load like.

219
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,506
You see you're using 30% of location, so it means

220
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:08,106
what are you doing all the time with location and

221
00:14:08,128 --> 00:14:11,898
Whatnot? Yeah that's one thing. The other thing is

222
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:15,550
related to that. If you go in your iPhone, in settings battery, for example,

223
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,658
this is basically were users go if the battery is draining.

224
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:24,094
Right. So you really dont want your app to be in this list because

225
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:28,180
it's kind of like the losers list at the same time. It also means that

226
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,666
if you are over there, it means that your app is well used by the

227
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,234
user. Right. So to give you an example on those two

228
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:38,902
screens, the top app over there, which is Tiger show, is from

229
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:41,954
the first channel in Germany from IRD.

230
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:45,814
So I use it a lot. But what's interesting is that it's kind of

231
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,126
weird that it has been draining 27% of my

232
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:52,186
battery. What's even more weird is if I go to the next screen is you

233
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:55,754
will see that it has

234
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,162
actually been only used 18 minutes in total. So it's really

235
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:02,806
not a lot. So I wonder what was

236
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:06,400
wrong over there. Right? And so you have to

237
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,118
have a look at this. And actually I hope that not only you as

238
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:14,526
a developer, but you as a user, look at over there or in

239
00:15:14,548 --> 00:15:18,018
macOS you have the same thing. Look over there on the top bar, what kind

240
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:21,166
of app is using your better and just report to developer,

241
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,930
say to the developer what's wrong? And so

242
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,286
yeah, that's one of the things you can do. The other thing you can do

243
00:15:27,308 --> 00:15:31,190
is run 100% renewable energy, whether it's your app

244
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,302
infrastructure or your company or whatever. The best case

245
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:38,682
is to have your own pvs photovoltaic like solar

246
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:43,420
panels. That's what Ecosia do by the way, they run all

247
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,746
their business renewable and

248
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:52,426
they generate actually more than 100%. They generate I think 200% or something like that,

249
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:56,046
or 250 whatever. And if it's not possible to have your

250
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:59,706
own pvs, then run from 100% renewable energy provider,

251
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:03,086
right? If you have to go from the grid. But please don't pick a mixed

252
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:06,814
company. And by mixed company I mean like for example RWE

253
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:10,066
in Germany, this big bad company which has been digging holes. Sure they

254
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:11,540
have green products, right?

255
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,294
But yeah, that's not the idea behind

256
00:16:18,332 --> 00:16:21,750
it, right? Sure you can probably order your vegan food from Amazon,

257
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,160
but that's also not the idea behind it. Right?

258
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,778
And so speaking about apple, apple goes were carbon

259
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:33,146
neutral. They go on their website, if you have a company you

260
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:36,330
should do something. But my point here is carbon neutral is great,

261
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,362
apple, but it's not enough. It's just not enough. You should be 200%

262
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,570
renewable and they should say, hey, we're carbon negative. And actually apple

263
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,550
just for you. I made you a badge that you can put in your website.

264
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,782
Let's try to fix this together altogether. Right? Right.

265
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:54,138
Another thing, go vegan again. But I'm

266
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:58,274
not specifically saying that to yourself. But I'm also more

267
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:02,258
your company. You don't have to become yourself vegan from a day to

268
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:06,446
the other. But what if as a company you would say during lunch like Ecosia,

269
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,750
you wouldn't have any of those products. If you offer lunch,

270
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,470
it's actually pretty easy and it's actually better for the environment

271
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,754
because fruits belong to startup anyways, right?

272
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,578
So if you just have fruits and

273
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:27,674
add lots of fruits, people eat fruits so they will eat less of

274
00:17:27,712 --> 00:17:30,986
the other stuff during the day. So that would

275
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,814
be one thing in your company. You could also go plastic and packaging free.

276
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:38,846
Why not? In case you order pizza for example. That's just one

277
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:42,478
of the example. There is this website called order Green, I think it's only in

278
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:47,010
German but you get the idea. And they basically made

279
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,486
this reusable packaging. If you want to have a vegan pizza,

280
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:55,166
a lot of pizzeria they dont have it. Just take the vegetarian

281
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:58,998
pizza and ask them to not put any cheese. Offer breakfast at

282
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:02,966
your company would be also a way to go kind

283
00:18:02,988 --> 00:18:07,106
of packaging free. Because if you have like cereals in ten kilo

284
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:11,210
packages we buy at home, for example, a lot of our stuff, whether it's

285
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,318
pasta or cereals in big ten kilo packages.

286
00:18:15,414 --> 00:18:19,254
We're a big family of six people. So we try to generate

287
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:22,826
less plastic and use, please use ceramic

288
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:26,810
cups, not plastic cups. And stop grabbing a coffee

289
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,158
with something you have to throw away. If you

290
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:33,450
want to grab your coffee in the morning, then have your own cup,

291
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,106
even if it's a plastic cup. Obviously it can be. But the

292
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:41,010
one you reuse all the time, right? And finally go out

293
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,450
to eat with the company because when you go out at lunch

294
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,642
there is a big chance that you are actually producing less crash,

295
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:52,086
right? Because call of those companies, like all of those

296
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:54,920
restaurants for example, they just wash their dishes, right?

297
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,630
Also we need more home office, it's less cost,

298
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,522
right? But it's also less traffic, it's less co2.

299
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:06,106
So less people taking their cars or whatever. The downside is that each one

300
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:09,366
is taking their own decision, for example in electricity wise.

301
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:13,214
So even if your

302
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,718
company has a green provider, you cannot be sure that

303
00:19:16,804 --> 00:19:20,126
the people that are working for you at home have their

304
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:23,262
own green electricity. Write them an email and say

305
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:27,294
hey, we are happy to be 100% renewable

306
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:30,674
at the company. But would you want to

307
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,794
help us do the same thing at home. Maybe you can even strike a deal

308
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:36,962
with some electricity company. I don't know. If you're a big company enough,

309
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:40,422
you can have a rebate. The upside is that it's also way better

310
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:44,962
work life and family balance. I've been working myself remotely

311
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:48,806
since many, many years. And really, I don't know why I would want to go

312
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:52,730
back to regularly, at least to the office. My current

313
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,946
company, to give you an example in terms of the cost,

314
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,850
has an office, or we are about to change the office and

315
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,994
the new office will have room for 35

316
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:07,310
people. The thing is, until we move over there, we will be 70 people,

317
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,246
right? So you're getting it so it years that we will have a system

318
00:20:11,348 --> 00:20:14,718
where you have to kind of say, register when you want to

319
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:17,906
go to the office. If you absolutely have to go to the office. Are you

320
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:20,754
walking or are you biking? Right. Call.

321
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:24,386
Right? You're not neither. But you're taking the train, right?

322
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:27,794
You are taking the train. But worst

323
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:30,578
case, you have an EV, right? Like an electrical vehicle,

324
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:34,262
like battery powered. And my car

325
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,022
is 100% based on renewable energies at home. I'm really happy

326
00:20:38,076 --> 00:20:41,882
to speak about evs. I've been driving an EV since three years.

327
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:45,574
Way better is to use the train and way better is to use the bike.

328
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:49,530
Or if you can walk, it's even better. Try to reduce or quit flying.

329
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,734
It's been three years. I'm fine with it. I haven't been flying

330
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:57,118
anymore. I'm sure at one point in the future I will have to

331
00:20:57,124 --> 00:21:00,526
fly again for whatever reason, but I'm trying not to. Even when

332
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:04,218
I was, for example, going to iOS devs UK, which is in Wales,

333
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:07,538
which was a long trip with the train, basically the whole day I took the

334
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:11,522
train. And it was interesting. You see a lot of years

335
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:14,420
and you can work also longer.

336
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:18,098
Online conferences are great. And otherwise,

337
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,702
like I was telling you, just use the train and please stop

338
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:25,302
going for a company weekend in Mallorca if you are a german company

339
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:28,822
or whatever. And generally please stop going

340
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:32,346
because it's cheap. Don't go into this thing like,

341
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:35,626
oh, it's cheap. So I'm going for two days trip in Majorca and over there

342
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:38,010
I'm going to do some nature mountain biking.

343
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,160
It's ridiculous. Make an app that does good for the world,

344
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,654
not just the next useless app.

345
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:49,838
Be that CEO, the one that cares about the world. If you can start a

346
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:51,600
company like sonomotors, for example,

347
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,358
they are working on a solar powered

348
00:21:57,454 --> 00:22:01,934
car which will hopefully see the light of the day in 2023. Right now prototypes

349
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:06,018
are there and they started their company with

350
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:09,414
the idea of not selling a car

351
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:12,838
to every single person, but sharing the car with other people. For example,

352
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:16,678
it's weird to start a company, a car company to have

353
00:22:16,844 --> 00:22:20,806
lets car, but that's one of the goals they will most probably achieve.

354
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:24,186
And it's a mess out there so there are many problems to fix. Keep it

355
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,770
small and so you generate less

356
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,546
co2. Use the inspectors like the network's inspector seeing to see

357
00:22:31,568 --> 00:22:35,226
which part is that you will probably discover that there is like a four megabyte

358
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:39,166
pictures over there which could be actually six hundred k.

359
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:42,510
Do you really need that 100 megabyte video on the front page?

360
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,286
Probably not. And also please don't do autoplay. It's not

361
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:49,650
only bad for the environment, it's also bad in terms of user experience

362
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,026
because I don't want to go on a website having a video played on my

363
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:56,660
face. The iPhone, since the iPhone X has been using an OLED screen,

364
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,866
we still don't have older on the iPads and still no OLEDs on the Macs.

365
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:04,274
That's too bad. So really you might notice,

366
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:08,294
but a dark pixel on an older screen is actually not turned on.

367
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:11,510
So it's sparing energy. Turn off your tv, use a power switch.

368
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,746
Automatic updates is the thing that I will show you now, which is that if

369
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,058
you look over there, what you

370
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:21,674
can see over there on the top, I turned off

371
00:23:21,712 --> 00:23:24,942
the automatic app updates and apps for whatever

372
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:28,526
reason. I have music over there and books as well.

373
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:32,474
So it means that every time that I will download a music on one device,

374
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:36,206
it would download on the other one. I'm not sure how old the screenshot

375
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:39,426
is, but definitely when I install an app on

376
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:43,058
a device, it won't install on another device because this is not what I

377
00:23:43,064 --> 00:23:46,286
want. And also the updates. I know it's kind of weird,

378
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:49,958
but one of the thing that I like about doing the updates myself,

379
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:54,166
besides the fact that I don't want to have to update some

380
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:57,494
of the apps every two weeks, there are a lot of

381
00:23:57,692 --> 00:24:00,440
apps out there like Facebook for example,

382
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,974
which are basically working in this sprint update

383
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:07,754
thing. Like every two weeks they will release a new app and so I don't

384
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:11,546
necessarily need it. But the other

385
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:14,826
thing is, I realize a lot of time, oh, this app, I haven't

386
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:17,886
been using it forever, so I'm just going to delete it.

387
00:24:17,988 --> 00:24:20,910
Stop. Now I really, really have to stop.

388
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,282
And this is why I'm really happy I'm

389
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:27,658
saying Shukran here, which is thank you in Arabic.

390
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,954
You can find me over there at Seth MC on Twitter.

391
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,142
I'm on Instagram as well with Seth MCM, and this is my email

392
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:36,630
if you want to get in touch with me. And now I am really,

393
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,210
really more than happy to speak with some of you in the Q and A's.
