00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,126
Hello, good day. Welcome to this presentation how to develop a

2
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:07,950
web three app in blockchain with JavaScript Frontend

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,094
and Python backend. You can develop in JavaScript or

4
00:00:12,212 --> 00:00:16,458
JavaScript but focusing in this presentation

5
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:20,026
we are developing in JavaScript and Python,

6
00:00:20,138 --> 00:00:23,230
Python in backend or any language in backend.

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,182
Cisco Rodriguez is my name from

8
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,150
latin chain introduction

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,150
to PI Network and PI browser.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:40,220
The first step we will

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,674
have here Latin shame the repository and how

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,066
to develop a app a web three web app

13
00:00:49,168 --> 00:00:54,880
in blockchain with JavaScript Frontend

14
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,538
and Python backend introduction

15
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:04,750
to PI Network, TM PI browser

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,766
and Pyap platform PI

17
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:14,210
Network TM is a

18
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,654
new crypto based on stellar where you can

19
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:20,870
mine cryptos from your phone daily.

20
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,338
This like bitcoin

21
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,670
or any other crypto.

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,378
The mining of the crypto with

23
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:38,780
PI app in Android or

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,342
the other system like for example

25
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,742
app PI browser is a new browser

26
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:59,522
kind of metamask but specifically for

27
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:02,690
PI network. For that crypto.

28
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,858
PI app platform is the app to develop

29
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:11,330
PI app latticent repository

30
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,646
Lattice is a PI app webtress app winner of

31
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:18,242
PI Hackathon 2021 where you can play games

32
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:21,994
daily using cryptos. The hit hub repo is this

33
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:25,654
with code in Python, JavaScript and HTML.

34
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:29,290
We are going to see this repository more

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,390
on in the following presentation.

36
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,240
How to develop a PI app use

37
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,674
app platform to develop your front end in

38
00:02:44,712 --> 00:02:49,186
JavaScript or JavaScript in back end in

39
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:53,490
any language following these instructions

40
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,698
you can develop JavaScript with JavaScript

41
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:01,350
in frontend. What are you going to do with

42
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,458
frontend? You can capt

43
00:03:05,554 --> 00:03:09,820
or catch from the users the

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,020
request to pay and

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,514
that payment request is going to the back

46
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:23,614
end. That's why it's important the

47
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:27,742
front end to catch the user requests. And then

48
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:31,182
in the back end you can do the request to the

49
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:35,082
PI app platform not only from users

50
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:38,814
but for PI app platform. When you get the request

51
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,474
from Piyabi platform,

52
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:46,246
you get the response from there and

53
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:50,134
return the response to the frontend and

54
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:54,566
the users will have an answer

55
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,390
for his request.

56
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,186
Okay then here web are

57
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,690
going to see the heathub repository for Latin chain.

58
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,514
Then we are going there and the Heathub repository

59
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:14,378
is that link you saw in the presentation.

60
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:19,342
In the slide is hithop.com

61
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:23,694
piaps Latinchain PI apps is an

62
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:28,606
organization in Hithub for PI

63
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:31,570
app ecosystem.

64
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,214
Latin chain is open source. You can develop

65
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:39,346
over Latin chain new apps,

66
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:43,734
but only if that app is

67
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:47,430
inside the params of PI network.

68
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,978
I mean if you want to develop in Latin chain, you have

69
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:56,554
to use that new system

70
00:04:56,672 --> 00:05:00,358
you made in PI network. You can't use

71
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:05,454
that system in other platform

72
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:09,230
that is competitor of PI network.

73
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,202
You can watch here the license. The license says

74
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:19,214
that the copyright Cesar

75
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:22,734
Cordero Rodriguez and Latin

76
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:26,482
chain and the SEC permission had to be granted

77
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:31,334
and all this and the

78
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,920
permissions you have.

79
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,034
Okay then how

80
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,046
to develop a PI app here with PI network

81
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:47,274
and with the help of Latin Shane you

82
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:51,838
go to the repository and there is a

83
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:55,550
folder called Docs

84
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,520
Fierce app.

85
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,038
Here you have how to develop a fierce Pynettor

86
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:07,330
app. I use Odo to develop this app.

87
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,506
Mainnet you have it the link

88
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:15,734
testnet this link you maybe could

89
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:18,338
use your framework election.

90
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:21,734
The link I have said

91
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:25,430
before is latinchain.com

92
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,180
for mainnet and Testnet test latinchain.com

93
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,594
okay this is the official documentation to build

94
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,060
a PI app in Piabi platform.

95
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,510
Okay you have the link developers

96
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,698
mindpie.com official Pyap

97
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:53,070
demo example code hillhop.com pyapps

98
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,430
demo simplest

99
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,514
example for users two app

100
00:07:02,712 --> 00:07:06,694
payment and the following is a working example

101
00:07:06,812 --> 00:07:10,198
for receiving the payments in PI platform.

102
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:14,390
This is for client side HTML.

103
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,002
We have this example in Javascript and

104
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:23,260
the example in backend in PsP but

105
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,660
going back for a moment,

106
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,674
you have the latin chain

107
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:37,166
system working the working latin chain system in

108
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:40,800
latinchain.com that you have the

109
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,722
code here and you can watch in the code

110
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:49,010
website PI network auto and website PI network

111
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,690
PI network games Odo you have models

112
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,014
and you have in Python how

113
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:02,946
to develop here you have to use ODO

114
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:10,140
14 to develop over these

115
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,770
models of Latin chain.

116
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,334
Okay but in the simple example you

117
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:29,774
have in the docs first app you

118
00:08:29,812 --> 00:08:35,554
have a server side PSP in

119
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:39,474
PsP you have example in PSP to

120
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:42,478
let you know you can use any backend.

121
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,914
I'm using backend in Psp

122
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:49,542
for example for an example and

123
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:52,840
in Python for my working app.

124
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,982
So for you you can use Psp

125
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:01,850
or python if you want to develop over odo

126
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,180
using my app to make it work

127
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,934
in several one php you

128
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:17,822
need to change the app code as out app

129
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:21,758
one by the one coming from client request example

130
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:25,870
if you have out example in client Javascript

131
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,762
site you must

132
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:33,010
set it in several one php.

133
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,360
Then you have to access

134
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,200
this link PI app example

135
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,380
in latin chain developments and you have in

136
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:57,580
main HTML you have okay,

137
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,734
you have here the

138
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:07,120
code and you can

139
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,710
let me check here. Okay here

140
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,026
app client out example if

141
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:18,980
you have example here you need

142
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,130
to use the same out example in

143
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,330
JavaScript,

144
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,640
the same out example in the back end side.

145
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:41,100
Then I'm using here auth example and

146
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,478
this is all developed.

147
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:49,642
You just need to use a configuration out

148
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:53,374
example out example in the front end out example in the back

149
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:57,550
end and you have it working. You have to set here your

150
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,430
app key from the PI browser,

151
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:09,220
okay, there are some steps you need to use,

152
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,114
okay, you have the

153
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:18,066
documentation, the official documentation

154
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:21,400
in PI SDK documentation, okay?

155
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:28,146
And you have working an

156
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:33,322
example you have here

157
00:11:33,376 --> 00:11:37,274
read me and you have the official documentation from that

158
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:40,910
link I said in the presentation.

159
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,102
And you can watch the official documentation here

160
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:50,974
to develop in a PI app a

161
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:53,540
web dress web three PI app,

162
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,962
okay. But here I'm giving

163
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:09,334
you all examples in just one side app

164
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:13,222
to user payment because the first example is

165
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:17,560
user to app payment when an end user will pay

166
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,726
to an app and this

167
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:26,950
is for app to user payment. You have to read the documentation

168
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,478
and the official documentation that you have here in

169
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:36,480
developers developers mindpie.com

170
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,250
official documentation and you have app to user payment

171
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,430
in Ruby node, JS,

172
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,970
Python, Go Blazor and C sharp.

173
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,626
If we find here PI

174
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:03,446
browser we

175
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:11,082
will watch the

176
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:15,034
apps working for

177
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:18,540
example Latin Shane or any other app

178
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:35,654
and you will watch many apps here latin

179
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:40,620
shame for example and

180
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,340
you will see it working with

181
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,630
cryptos.

182
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,538
Play games using cryptos, okay share Sudoko

183
00:13:54,554 --> 00:13:58,222
Snake if you are a developer that

184
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:02,094
is a thing for us. We are

185
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,070
developers,

186
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,398
okay, for developers the

187
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:15,110
the documentation is

188
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,230
