00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,966
Hello everyone, I am Alberto Garcia Garcia and I am going to

2
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:27,270
talk. And this talk is going to be about my quantum career.

3
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,606
Well, I'm from Joca in Spain, but I'm based now

4
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:35,890
in Madrid at Accenture. And well, I studied physics in university

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,510
in Madrid because it was my favorite subject

6
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,420
at the school, at the high school.

7
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,206
Then I realized that I really liked quantum mechanics. And it's

8
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,146
when I did my last year of my Erasmus change in tomb,

9
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:54,080
where I specialize on quantum information.

10
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,966
Then I started working in accenture at Madrid, where I'm based now.

11
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:02,830
And I also did quantum chemistry,

12
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,370
theoretical and computational chemistry master.

13
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,706
And I also developed some quantum computing courses while I

14
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:16,694
was learning myself. Now I'm leading the quantum computing team here

15
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:20,434
in Spain at Accenture, developing real proof of concept,

16
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:23,874
real use cases for the industry. But let's take a look deeper

17
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:27,714
into that, because this is just a quick

18
00:01:27,772 --> 00:01:31,386
introduction. What about me?

19
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:34,634
Well, as I said, if we see

20
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:38,042
in the left side of the corner, this is a timeline that I will explain,

21
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:40,810
more or less my trajectory.

22
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,754
I started studying physics in university akobutanza, Madrid,

23
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,614
in 2012.

24
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:52,606
And in 2015,

25
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:56,354
more or less, I decided to do my last year of my degree of my

26
00:01:56,392 --> 00:01:59,986
bachelor's, my bachelor on an

27
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:03,490
Erasmus exchange. And that's why I decided to go to Munich,

28
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,286
because I think the place could give me a lot

29
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:10,534
of opportunities. And this is what it was. In third year

30
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:13,654
of my degree, I realized that I

31
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:17,298
really love quantum mechanics. I did the subject of quantum mechanics.

32
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:21,100
Quantum physics, sorry. And I realized I really like it.

33
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,386
That's why when I go to my last year of my

34
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,714
Erasmus exchange in Munich, I decided to do as

35
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:31,710
much subjects as possible around quantum mechanics.

36
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,210
Honestly, it was really grateful because I could decide

37
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,586
any subject I wanted. So I really focused on quantum

38
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,218
mechanics. Moreover, I saw that there was the opportunity to

39
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:47,442
work in the Max Planck Institute. So I decided to work

40
00:02:47,496 --> 00:02:51,330
there. Unfortunately, there wasn't open the position I wanted

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,706
in the quantum computing department. I spoke with them

42
00:02:54,728 --> 00:02:58,086
and I did some work, but not much. But where I did work is in

43
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:01,826
the nuclear physics department. And by that time I knew that quantum

44
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:05,442
mechanics was my favorite subject. But I really liked

45
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:09,100
as well nuclear physics. So that's why I was working.

46
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,490
I worked in the nuclear physics department,

47
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,062
where I worked to understand and analyze

48
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:23,094
the polition of particles around the Alice. The Alice

49
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:27,038
is a large. I don't collider. Remember the

50
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:30,526
last word. Sorry. But this is a project of CERN, where I

51
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:33,770
received all the data that was between the collision

52
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,102
of two protons and then I needed to identify

53
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:42,642
what kind of atoms were

54
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:45,940
formed from this collision. I really enjoyed that work.

55
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,226
And Tomb Munich, because I studied in

56
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:54,166
tomb and then Max Planck Institute is nearby, so I

57
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:57,110
also work, as I said, in the Max Planck Institute.

58
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,170
Tomb also gave me another opportunity and is to really decided

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,714
my degree thesis. Sorry. And I had the opportunity to

60
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:11,438
work on quantum cryptography. In fact,

61
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:15,066
my bachelor thesis, my degree thesis

62
00:04:15,178 --> 00:04:18,954
was around quantum information and quantum cryptography.

63
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:22,426
Basically having deep research on that since the

64
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:26,162
beginning and finally explaining the BB 84

65
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:29,490
protocol for quantum key distribution.

66
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,274
Then when I finished at Munich, my studies, I came

67
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:37,682
back to Madrid and I started working in accenture. Why?

68
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,574
Because all the people surrounded me. I knew that I wanted

69
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:45,030
to do academia, but due to my personal situation,

70
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,518
I needed to start working. So that's why all the

71
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:52,220
people around me told me that consulting films has very interesting,

72
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,458
because they give you a lot of different possibilities to work on,

73
00:04:56,544 --> 00:04:59,974
not only just one of specified job. And that's why I decided to start working

74
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:04,126
in Accenture. At Accenture. The first year,

75
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:08,094
the first two years, because I have been in Accenture since six years

76
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:08,720
ago,

77
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,530
I started in the consulting finance department.

78
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,070
I liked the work was doing, but coming from physics,

79
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,626
I realized that I needed more. I wanted to do really interesting

80
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:26,058
problems and really interesting use cases. And that's

81
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:29,686
why I started on March 2017 at

82
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,254
Accenture. And on September 2017, I was

83
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,930
super lucky and super fortunate because a managing director,

84
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,010
Ulysses Arant at Accenture,

85
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,490
decided to start working on quantum computing. So I was super lucky because

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,618
I contacted him and he accepted me. And then we found it

87
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:52,334
with another partner, Jaime. With another mate for me,

88
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:55,642
Jaime, we founded the quantum computing department in Iberia.

89
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:59,786
Iberia Tax center is the region that is gathering Portugal,

90
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:03,746
Spain and Israel. Then since

91
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:07,234
September 2017, I was still

92
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:10,526
in the consulting finance department doing finance projects.

93
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:14,162
But then since September 2017, till now,

94
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:17,510
I've been working on quantum computing. But since

95
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,126
2017, September till more or

96
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,802
less February 2018, I was in the consulting finance department.

97
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,702
But from 2018 till

98
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:32,438
2021, I was in the applied

99
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:36,678
intelligence department. That is the data scientist, that engineering and business intelligence department.

100
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:39,930
So what happened that these three years,

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,414
more or less, when I started one year and then the following three years,

102
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:46,942
I was doing quantum computing on my behalf, on my free time

103
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:50,654
and sometime inside work. But most of the working hours I was doing

104
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:53,818
data science, data engineering and business intelligent employees

105
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:57,202
in clients. I needed to do both things at the same

106
00:06:57,256 --> 00:07:00,100
time, because quantum computing was an emerging technology,

107
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,754
but I was belonging to another department. So I was really

108
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,242
doing data science, classical data science and business

109
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:11,794
intelligence projects. But as quantum computing, quantum technologies.

110
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:15,174
Quantum mechanics is my passion. That's why

111
00:07:15,212 --> 00:07:18,454
I really wanted to work on it.

112
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,420
I was doing it as much time as I can,

113
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,574
most of the weekends, not all the weekend, because I really love resting

114
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:29,610
to rest as well. And Sundays I need to rest because otherwise I get crazy.

115
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,680
But Friday afternoon, evenings and Saturday morning, I usually

116
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,254
got used to work on quantum computing. So this is

117
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:42,126
more the time frame where we are right now. And in 2018 as well,

118
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:45,746
I was in the BBBA project. That was the first quantum computing project I

119
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:48,914
work on, and it was very, very interesting.

120
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:52,290
This was done, of course, in his accenture hours, not in my free time,

121
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,594
but was very interesting. Moreover, in 2019,

122
00:07:56,722 --> 00:08:00,114
I started being a teacher in the quantum Technologies master

123
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:04,050
of the university, Polytechnic of Madrid. University of Polytechnica in Madrid.

124
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,126
In fact, I want to say hello to Jane Pratik,

125
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:12,202
that I know that he's also talking about his really amazing work

126
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:15,702
on Gen AI,

127
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:19,814
on life science, and I just want to say hello to him. Super proud

128
00:08:19,862 --> 00:08:23,146
and glad that he's speaking now on quantum computing.

129
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:26,986
Okay. And then since 2018,

130
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:31,470
more or less till 2022,

131
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,294
I was in the applied intelligence department, but also working on quantum computing

132
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:38,706
all time evangelization of the ecosystem, doing a lot of

133
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:42,334
talks, et cetera. Still developing proof of concept,

134
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:46,454
internal and client proof of concepts. But since 2022,

135
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:49,442
I moved to the global quantum computing department.

136
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:53,590
And yeah, my dream became really, I'm now

137
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,366
spending since 2022, 100% of

138
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:01,834
my time working on quantum technologies. So since then,

139
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:05,386
I've been doing more or less the same work, but much more, developing much

140
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:09,062
more internal assets, leading the team here in Iberia, in Spain,

141
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:12,622
Portugal, Israel, in Iberia, and doing the same

142
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:17,598
talks, et cetera, and working with real client projects now,

143
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,862
and it's public. I'm working in Atlantic, that is

144
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:24,514
a north regime of Spain, where we are developing proof of concepts around

145
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:27,666
quantum computing, trying to get the limits of the technology

146
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:30,370
and really benchmark how it is feasible.

147
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,722
And just to add one more thing, in my career,

148
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:40,386
this is more or less, I did a teacher. I have been also a teacher

149
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:44,386
of other masters, like in the university in university

150
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,846
autonoma de Madrid. And one more

151
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:51,318
thing that I need to say is that more or less on 2018,

152
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:55,094
I also did a master on theoretical

153
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:58,954
and computational chemistry, because I'm cross industry. I work in

154
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:02,606
finance, supply chain, life science, et cetera. But I

155
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:05,838
really want to specialize on life science for problems

156
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:09,326
like drug discovery or protein folding. And that's why I did

157
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:13,280
this master because I needed to know more about this.

158
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,762
I needed to know more about this

159
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:22,002
area and that's why I wanted to do this, because thanks to this, it gave

160
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:25,586
me a lot of knowledge on how to implement quantum computing

161
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:28,950
for quantum chemistry problems. Then,

162
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,354
since last year, our global quantum

163
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:35,782
computing team in Iberia has changed. We are not

164
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,470
now only covering quantum computing.

165
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,500
My team is now called Next gen computing team

166
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,382
and is covering several other technologies, good INX technologies

167
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:51,534
like neuromorphic technology. We are also covering now quantum security

168
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,246
that, as you know, is a must and everybody should need to

169
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:58,414
be aware of and really take

170
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:01,562
into consideration for future quantum computer attacks.

171
00:11:01,706 --> 00:11:05,242
HPC privacy per saving computing

172

confidential computing space experiments computing

173
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:11,822
space compute we're coming much more technologies.

174
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:15,410
But yeah, just speak about the quantum career.

175
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,806
This is more or less a bit of my

176
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:25,000
career where I am now working on or where I work on

177
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,126
in the different areas in the university I studied in the university computing

178
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:34,166
Madrid the tomb and I also study my theoretical and quantum chemistry

179
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:37,686
master in university autonomy Madrid in the sense of academia,

180
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:41,358
I work as a teacher University of Polytechnica Madrid. I work in the

181
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:45,054
Max plan and in terms of consortium, I'm in

182
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:48,922
Ametic. Ametic is the spanish

183
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:52,474
industry consortium where we have a working group around

184
00:11:52,532 --> 00:11:56,194
quantum technologies, and I am leading the use case working

185
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:59,794
group inside of it. And then I am

186
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:03,506
also actively participating in the quantum industry consortium in

187
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:06,914
Quic. There I am contributing in the

188
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:10,998
use case workgroup, but basically I am

189
00:12:11,084 --> 00:12:14,760
actively participating in the work group three. That is called education,

190
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,094
because one of the main goals in my life is helping

191
00:12:19,142 --> 00:12:23,594
people. I really like helping people and try to get

192
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:27,978
the best of everyone. And that's why I

193
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:31,546
don't want never to be separate of academia, because I think that teaching is very

194
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:35,294
important in life. And that's why I am also concerned that for

195
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:38,302
quantum technologies, talent is going to be a must.

196
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:41,994
And it's very difficult nowadays to find talent around quantum

197
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:45,522
technologies. We will see that later on. But it's very important that

198
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:49,266
everybody upskills their own skills as well as

199
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,860
study quantum technologies to understand the technology.

200
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,354
Okay, so now I will tell you what I've been doing in

201
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:59,460
accenture quantum computing Iberia lead,

202
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,254
because I now explain a bit of

203
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:06,774
my career, but I also would explain what I've been doing exactly around

204
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:10,318
quantum computing. Well, first of all, and I'm

205
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:14,166
sure that you all know that quantum computing is going to be the following

206
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,658
continuous technology that will disrupt at all the business.

207
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:21,622
In fact, we did a survey in the New York metropolitan

208
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:25,178
area a few years ago where in

209
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:28,222
this survey we get this number, that is the

210
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:32,362
97% of the people of the survey thought,

211
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:35,874
and I think they now think that

212
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:39,522
quantum computing is going to be much

213
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:42,802
more disruptive than AI. And this is something

214
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:46,680
to really keep in mind, because disruption is happening now,

215
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,830
and everybody needs to be prepared.

216
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:54,534
In fact, one of the key areas is not only the investment that

217
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:58,214
public government is doing, this is hugely all private companies and

218
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:02,106
public companies are doing huge risk, but also how the

219
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:06,070
ecosystem has been growing since I started in 2017

220
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,834
working on quantum computing, that there were only, I don't know,

221
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:12,782
three, four, five companies, maybe ten.

222
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:17,210
But those ten five were the big players, like IBM,

223
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,582
Google, et cetera. So now you can see that the ecosystem is quite large,

224
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:24,898
and even that is starting, growing every time.

225
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:27,570
So this is just the very beginning.

226
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,774
That's why in Accenture, we really understand that this emerging

227
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:35,146
technology is very, this emerging

228
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,018
technology is very disruptive,

229
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:41,426
very different from what we already know. And that's

230
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:47,446
why we need to understand, and we

231
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,854
need to ensemble all possibilities, like talent.

232
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:54,134
That is a priority for us. We did, since the very beginning,

233
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:58,394
a lot of internal trainings for our people, because we understand that this

234
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,834
technology is not easy. It's a change of mindset.

235
00:15:01,962 --> 00:15:05,550
And this needs training strategy.

236
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,710
All businesses needs to know how this technology

237
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,826
will impact their business, because the adoption of it is not easy,

238
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:17,234
and everybody needs to know it. And the other

239
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:20,370
thing that I would like to highlight is experimentation.

240
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,962
Understanding the technology is not only training and

241
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:28,454
reading papers, it's also experimenting with it. We need to

242
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,942
grow with the technology. And for this case, you need to really

243
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:35,906
develop quantum algorithms and apply those quantum algorithms

244
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:39,482
to real use cases. That's why usually

245
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:43,658
startups, and it's super good, they have the norm. Startups or companies,

246
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,874
they have the norm to approach a

247
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,510
bottom up approach. What does it mean that they get a specific

248
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,190
quantum algorithm and a specific use case and they apply it,

249
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,578
okay, and it's absolutely fine. But where we realize

250
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:01,450
from our success use cases, success stories,

251
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,566
is that a top down approach is better. We don't go

252
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:09,486
for the quantum algorithm and then apply this quantum algorithm

253
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:12,754
to the use case. We do the opposite from the use case. We go to

254
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:16,478
business and say, hey, what are your dependencies? What do you need?

255
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:20,102
Then we get the use case, and then we apply the best

256
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:23,974
quantum algorithm that fits to the requirements and to give them

257
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:27,734
business value. Our key differentiator, our differentiator value

258
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:31,994
at Accenture on quantum computing is that we always try to give business value,

259
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,530
not just applying quantum. That's why we consider

260
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,386
an end to end architecture. Okay. That's why

261
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:43,434
we consider can end to end architecture where we orchestrate

262
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:47,280
different pieces of the different layers to

263
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,006
use the best software for dedicated problem as

264
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:53,860
well as the best hardware for dedicated problem.

265
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,734
This is just a bit of commercial, where it's

266
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:03,346
all of our services, where we have, since the showcase demo to

267
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:06,982
the business experiment on the middle, a bit right

268
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:10,310
of the slide. The business experiment is the most important

269
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,974
one for me because it's when we have the delivery, we implement that.

270
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:17,798
But of course, the long term projects

271
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:21,206
like the strategic next steps like innovation or quantum

272
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:24,746
foundry, to really understand how the technology is going

273
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:28,086
to be impacted

274
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:31,258
in the business, are also very important as well as all the services. But for

275
00:17:31,264 --> 00:17:34,682
me, the business experiment, because with this experimentation

276
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:38,506
is where you really learn quantum computing. Iberia lead how quantum computing

277
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:41,470
works and what are the limits of quantum computing.

278
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,886
Some of the examples that we did at Accenture, some of the demos

279
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:49,922
we have is currency arbitrage. It is an optimization problem

280
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:53,122
that we applied in BBBA and this is based

281
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:57,330
on what is the best path that we need to go forward to get benefit

282
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,110
of changes on arbitrage, on currencies.

283
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,098
Another example of the life science industry is the molecular companies.

284
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:09,462
By doing again an optimization problem,

285
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:13,734
we can compare two different molecules and see how

286
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:15,480
similar they are.

287
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:25,198
You another demo

288
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:28,846
that we have, another application that we did is the

289
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:32,494
quantum intelligent power scheduling. It is based that

290
00:18:32,532 --> 00:18:35,490
we have different batteries. It's electrical trading.

291
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,586
This use case is from the resource, it's from

292
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:43,586
the resource industry. And it's basically that we have different batteries and

293
00:18:43,608 --> 00:18:47,430
those batteries can charge and discharge energy. So based on the energy

294
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,170
price, that is very volatile. What's the optimal

295
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,966
scheduling of the battery charging or discharging to

296
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:58,586
obtain as much benefit as possible while fulfilling the

297
00:18:58,608 --> 00:18:59,290
demand.

298
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,254
Another demo that we provided by the Airbus challenge is the aircraft loading

299
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:09,126
optimization. How we can get into the airplane,

300
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:14,030
the different boxes, what is the best structure and how

301
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,326
many boxes we can go enter the airplane to

302
00:19:17,348 --> 00:19:21,520
fit with the constraints of center of mass, maximum number of

303
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,306
weight, et cetera. And this

304
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:30,062
is not very related to quantum, but I wanted to highlight this credential.

305
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:33,342
We have this demo that is related to HPC.

306
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:37,186
That is one of the technologies we already saw in

307
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,514
the past. We already worked in the past, but this is one of the milestones

308
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:43,862
we had earlier, because here we really fit

309
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:47,474
with a production environment. We are tackling the PFAS

310
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:51,126
molecules. PFAS molecules are very dangerous for life and is

311
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:55,078
degrading for plastics and is one of the main problems of America.

312
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:59,242
Okay. And here the myson is that we use the

313
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:02,846
1 million core HPC from Intel and we

314
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,966
were able to architect all the jobs of the

315
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:09,390
execution to use all

316
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,854
the computational power that the 1 million come HPC

317
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:16,914
gave us. And it is good because we were very near to

318
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:20,846
get the minimal energy of the PFAS molecules,

319
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:23,220
not the biggest one, but almost the biggest one.

320
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:28,006
Then finally, what are my suggestions for your

321
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:31,126
quantum career? Quantum computing is true,

322
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:35,062
that is in a very earlier stage, and it's not now

323
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:39,340
giving revenues to the companies. But one thing is sure,

324
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,786
everyone is investing a lot of money because they know

325
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:47,254
that it's going to be disruptive. And as all technologies,

326
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:51,098
this is an exponential, and everything in life is an exponential learning.

327
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:54,814
What it means is that we don't want, I mean,

328
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:58,590
businesses shouldn't want to happen to their business.

329
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,870
What has happened to some of them. About the Gen AI,

330
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,022
the famous JGPT new so businesses

331
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:10,930
should be ready about quantum computing. Business should start now

332
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,706
around quantum computing. Even if it is

333
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:18,760
not giving now revenues, they should be ready for it because

334
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,726
the exponential learning, the exponential progress on the

335
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:26,082
technology could damage

336
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:29,274
them. The same as Gen AI for those businesses that

337
00:21:29,312 --> 00:21:33,290
haven't been prepared has just damaged them this year.

338
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,906
So every business needs to be prepared. So,

339
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:40,134
for you, if you are not prepared,

340
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:43,902
I mean, if you don't start learning quantum computing, if you don't start

341
00:21:43,956 --> 00:21:47,646
learning quantum technologies, it's true that now it might

342
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:51,066
not be a lot of positions on quantum technologies, and the positions

343
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:54,782
that there are are very difficult to access them

344
00:21:54,836 --> 00:21:58,754
because they really require very specific skills. Big companies want

345
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:02,866
someone that knows quantum technologies, but another skills as well. And we

346
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,014
understand that it's very difficult to get the quantum job nowadays.

347
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:09,526
But as businesses need to be prepared for when

348
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:12,550
the moment arrives and quantum gives a lot of revenues,

349
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,742
you need to be as well prepared for that

350
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:22,918
moment. Because if you don't study quantum computing now, if you don't start

351
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:26,502
studying quantum technology, quantum technologies now,

352
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,686
when this moment arrives and you want to start, there will be a lot of

353
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,386
people that already learn quantum computing

354
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,698
and will be in front of you in this race.

355
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:39,790
That's why my four recommendations for you is,

356
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,342
first, start studying quantum technologies now.

357
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:47,106
It's true that it could be difficult, it might be or not, because you

358
00:22:47,128 --> 00:22:50,450
could have the chance or not. I have several students, like, for example,

359
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,414
Jane Pratik is here explaining this. He's working on quantum

360
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:58,242
computing because he is the master of quantum technologies

361
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:01,846
in UPM, the first edition and now he's working. It's true

362
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:05,122
that there are other students that are not, but if you don't

363
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:08,534
start now studying quantum technologies, you don't know what

364
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:11,962
would happen. Secondly, apply to any open position around

365
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:15,098
quantum that might have. Of course it's true that you

366
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:18,394
need to apply the position you want, but if you don't try, you will

367
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:21,200
never know what happened. Third three,

368
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,938
you haven't any other skills, just quantum technology skills.

369
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:33,274
Learn another data scientist skills in case you want to do quantum

370
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:36,874
applications. If you want to do, for example, quantum hardware,

371
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:40,702
do engineering skills. What I'm trying to say is learn other

372
00:23:40,756 --> 00:23:44,494
skills about quantum technologies. Don't stop and say I cannot do that. Just learn

373
00:23:44,532 --> 00:23:48,200
more so you can improve your cv. And finally,

374
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,006
stay in tune for future opportunities because quantum is

375
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:55,634
a must. Everybody's investing and the opportunity will arrive.

376
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:59,478
So stay tuned and be prepared. Thank you very much to all

377
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:02,966
of you. Hope you enjoyed the session and please do not hesitate on

378
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:04,900
asking me for any question. Thank you.
