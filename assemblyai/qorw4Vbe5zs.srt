00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,242
Hi, I'm Emily Arnott, the content marketing manager at Blameless.

2
00:00:34,386 --> 00:00:38,690
And today I'm going to share with you something pretty exciting, a new definition

3
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,502
of reliability. In this talk, I'm going to break down a

4
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:45,858
surprisingly difficult question. What is reliability?

5
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:49,302
We're going to look at why we need to align on a single

6
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:52,398
definition, even though it can be kind of nebulous. We're going

7
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:55,386
to zoom out a little bit and take a look at how this definition applies

8
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:58,826
to the real world to get a little bit more context. Then we'll

9
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,478
zoom back into the technical and look at three different services

10
00:01:02,644 --> 00:01:06,014
and how this definition of reliability applies to them and

11
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:09,170
can help you prioritize. Then we'll take a look at the real

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,542
gritty question of how do you measure this new reliability?

13
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:16,066
How do you know you're moving towards it? So what is

14
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,078
reliability? We can all agree that it's very important, right?

15
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:23,122
It lives in the very center of what we do, site reliability

16
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:27,206
engineering. But once you actually start asking people, it becomes a

17
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:30,982
surprisingly nebulous question. If you ask ten different engineers,

18
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:34,442
give me your definition of reliability, you'll probably get ten different

19
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:38,374
answers. Maybe someone will say it's basically just your uptime,

20
00:01:38,422 --> 00:01:42,266
right? Like if you're reliably available,

21
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:46,206
that means you're reliable, and that makes sense, but maybe you

22
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,694
should include the error rate. Like, sure, the site is up, but if it's giving

23
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:53,146
the wrong information, that kind of makes it unreliable.

24
00:01:53,338 --> 00:01:56,274
And then if you're kind of thinking along those lines, well,

25
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:59,586
the speed matters too, if the site is giving the right information,

26
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:03,298
but at a snail's pace, are people really going to think of it

27
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:06,778
as reliable? Maybe some of the more SRE inclined

28
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:10,246
people could cite Google's SRE book and say that it all

29
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:14,242
comes down to the customer's expectations. They set the context

30
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:17,766
and the standard of what is reliable enough based on

31
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:21,674
their expectations. But that kind of just opens up more questions.

32
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:25,082
Like what customers? How do you know these

33
00:02:25,136 --> 00:02:28,378
expectations? How do youll know when they're happy? Do any of these really

34
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:32,250
cover everything? I think even if you can answer all of these questions,

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,598
I'm going to put forth that this still isn't holistic enough.

36
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:39,566
It still doesn't consider one key ingredient that we're going to get into.

37
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:43,130
And this stuff is important. Orgs of all sizes are realizing

38
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:46,366
that reliability should be a focus. In many cases,

39
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:50,062
it should be priority number one. And even if they don't know what reliability

40
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:53,954
exactly is, they know when it's missing. Here are

41
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:57,574
some examples of recent major outages among major tech

42
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:01,682
corporations. Within minutes, decades of goodwill,

43
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,590
of customer service, of customer happiness, can be wiped out

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,654
by one bad incident. The costs can be astronomical

45
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:13,430
for big companies and even more devastating

46
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,622
for small companies that don't have the leeway to recover from a major outage.

47
00:03:17,766 --> 00:03:21,110
If you aren't considering these sorts of factors,

48
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,506
incidents can easily overwhelm you and put you deep

49
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,786
into the red. So what is our working definition

50
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:30,926
of reliability? What is the one that I want to explain to you? Well,

51
00:03:30,948 --> 00:03:34,298
it starts with product health, which is something that I think

52
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:38,206
we all understand. It's what's being spit out by your monitoring

53
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:41,874
data. It's everything that you have in terms of how

54
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:45,454
your system is functioning, how fast it's functioning, how accurate

55
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:48,942
is it. But we like to contextualize that with customer happiness.

56
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:52,678
As it says in the Google SRE book, these numbers really mean nothing in a

57
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:56,690
vacuum. They have to be compared to what your customer's expectations

58
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,586
are. And then we have our third ingredient, which I think is all

59
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:04,026
too overlooked in the technical world, and what we consider kind of

60
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:07,462
the secret sauce of this new perspective,

61
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:10,974
sociotechnical resilience. This is the ability for your

62
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:15,226
teams to respond quickly, confidently and effectively

63
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,306
to any incident that may occur. And that's what we're really going to be focusing

64
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:22,734
on in this presentation. So think about the real

65
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:26,098
world, for example, and you'll find that this definition is probably

66
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:29,714
already deeply entrenched into how you

67
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:33,170
make decisions, how you judge the reliability of something

68
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,334
where you put your confidence. So consider flying.

69
00:04:36,462 --> 00:04:39,798
We'll set up our three buckets here, and then think about all

70
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:43,634
the different assumptions you make when you choose an airline. When you step onto

71
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:47,462
a flight in terms of customer happiness, you feel

72
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:50,486
like the airline is prioritizing your needs,

73
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:53,802
that they have some sort of picture of what would make you a happy,

74
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:57,238
satisfied customer. And the choices they make are aligned

75
00:04:57,254 --> 00:05:01,030
with that. You also assume that the airline systems are working properly,

76
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,606
that whatever computer programs are assigning you

77
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,134
tickets, are printing your boarding pass,

78
00:05:07,332 --> 00:05:10,746
are making sure that there is in fact a seat for everyone who bought

79
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,458
a ticket for that flight, that are displaying the correct gates.

80
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:17,986
All of these little things that build up the workings of the airline and the

81
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:21,362
airport are functioning properly. You trust these things.

82
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:24,958
You also trust that all the systems in place to stock the airline,

83
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:28,542
the actual airplane itself, are consistently functioning.

84
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,986
That there's going to be food and water, that the bathrooms

85
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:35,910
are going to work, that there's going to be toilet paper, all these little things

86
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,222
that you never even consider you're implicitly

87
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:43,046
assuming are happening behind the scenes consistently.

88
00:05:43,238 --> 00:05:46,554
And when it comes to these stocking choices, when it comes

89
00:05:46,592 --> 00:05:49,686
to the things they prepare, once again, there's this implicit

90
00:05:49,718 --> 00:05:53,134
assumption that the airline is making these choices based on what

91
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,574
youll want, that the airline understands what makes

92
00:05:56,612 --> 00:06:00,298
you a happy customer and are working along those lines.

93
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:03,918
But there's a major factor here, and this is something

94
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:08,002
so implicit that we don't really even think about it. But we also put

95
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:11,502
a lot of faith that all the people who are working at the airline,

96
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:14,786
that are flying the airplane, that are serving, you know what

97
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,430
they're doing. You assume that the pilot knows how to fly,

98
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,230
right? That goes without saying. You also assume that the crew will

99
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,746
show up on time and be ready to work. You assume that the crew

100
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:29,494
will be in good spirits, that they'll cooperate with each other

101
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:32,746
and with you, that they'll be able to execute on things that

102
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,250
you need them to do throughout the entire flight. These things go without

103
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,182
saying, and yet our understanding of what makes a good flight

104
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:43,966
is so rooted in them. It's so essential to the operation of the

105
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:48,126
entire industry. The airport staff itself also needs to know what to do.

106
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:52,474
We extend this sort of thinking about the sociotechnical resilience

107
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:56,002
and capability to everyone we interact with in the process

108
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,186
of flying the plane. So let's take

109
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:03,054
a look at when this breaks down. In the previous holiday season,

110
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:06,386
if you tried to fly out to see family or friends or go on a

111
00:07:06,408 --> 00:07:10,550
vacation, you may have had a rough time. You wouldn't be alone.

112
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,562
There was a once in a generation winter storm

113
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:17,320
that passed through the continental United States.

114
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,306
Over 3000 flights were canceled. We can

115
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:25,530
see here a dramatic spike in cancellations

116
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,642
over many years. And we can also

117
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:33,646
kind of examine how these things failed through the lens of

118
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:37,246
our three pronged definition of reliability. So we bring up

119
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:40,526
our buckets again. So something like bad weather we

120
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:44,674
can kind of contextualize as product health. And this is something that's not

121
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:48,478
always in the control of the people working at the airline.

122
00:07:48,654 --> 00:07:52,274
Something like bad weather certainly isnt. High demand is

123
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:55,986
also a customer oriented factor that puts a lot of strain on

124
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,426
these systems. Suddenly there were so many people wanting

125
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:02,806
to fly out for the holidays. It was way more flights needing to

126
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:06,006
be scheduled and filled and processed than

127
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,606
on any typical day. And then as a result, the systems start hitting

128
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:13,194
their limits. The algorithms and programs they have

129
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:17,366
set up to do things like automatic seat assignment to coordinate

130
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:21,630
different schedulings, layovers, making sure that everyone can

131
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,198
actually get on the flight, that they're meant to start breaking down

132
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:28,842
under this unreasonable amount of strain and sudden

133
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:32,154
changes. As a result, flights start getting canceled.

134
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:35,922
And this creates a huge domino effect where now

135
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:40,286
different connecting flights are being canceled, which causes flights

136
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:44,082
that they were meant to connect to, to be effectively canceled. And people

137
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:48,194
who have complex journeys of multiple layovers suddenly

138
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:52,374
have their whole house of cards falling apart. And what this resulted in

139
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:55,842
was a lot of unhappy customers, in part because this was communicated

140
00:08:55,906 --> 00:08:59,274
poorly. People weren't finding out that their flights were canceled until

141
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:03,290
it was way too late to make alternative plans after they would already

142
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,130
arrive at the airport. And now they're just stuck. It really

143
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,278
broke down this trust between the customers of

144
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,846
the airline and the airline itself. If they can't maintain the standard of

145
00:09:14,868 --> 00:09:19,118
communication, there is inconsistent messaging. People received completely

146
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:23,578
conflicting requests and confirmations

147
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:27,330
and were told one thing by one person and a different thing by another person.

148
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,990
And then on the sociotechnical side, we see downstream

149
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,406
of all of these changes in the customer's demands and their expectations and their happiness,

150
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:38,934
and then the systems that they were relying on. This creates a

151
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:42,674
sociotechnical resilience crisis. In many cases,

152
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:46,466
things that were done automatically by the systems now had to be performed

153
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:50,026
manually by people who probably weren't trained to do these

154
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,194
sorts of things. They weren't trained to have to process these

155
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:56,694
crisis situations. Also, as a result of the pandemic,

156
00:09:56,742 --> 00:10:00,566
a lot of airlines significantly downstaffed.

157
00:10:00,758 --> 00:10:04,030
They laid off people. They reduced in size as travel

158
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,266
wasn't really an option for a few years. And now, as demand has spiked

159
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:12,666
back to where it was before, if not higher, they're finding themselves understaffed.

160
00:10:12,698 --> 00:10:16,306
And people are stretched too thin and unable to perform all

161
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:20,238
of their normal duties, let alone all of the additional duties of this crisis.

162
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:23,586
And flying is just one example where we

163
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:27,362
can see a crisis of unreliability play

164
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,058
out in these three distinct areas. But it is really everywhere.

165
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:34,706
In fact, I would say if you think of any sort of service you're unhappy

166
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:38,394
with, you can very quickly start contextualizing it in these three

167
00:10:38,432 --> 00:10:42,934
categories to see how it really is. Always this threefold

168
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:46,518
breakdown that leads to an undesirable outcome.

169
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:50,814
For example, let's say you have a terrible cell phone provider. Well, what makes

170
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:54,062
them so terrible? Sure, maybe it's the phone

171
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:57,258
itself is not so great. It's missing features,

172
00:10:57,354 --> 00:11:01,838
it crashes, it's slow. Maybe the

173
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:05,762
networking functionality isn't very good. Your cell phone

174
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:09,362
provider doesn't have good service where you live. Maybe it's a

175
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,310
customer happiness issue where they're prioritizing profits

176
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,854
too much at the cost of having good customer service,

177
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:20,486
good customer feedback loops, responding to the needs and

178
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:24,034
market demands. And maybe it's a sociotechnical resilience

179
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:28,338
failure where even if they have the best intentions,

180
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:32,234
the people who are meant to supported you simply do not

181
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:35,786
have the training to deliver on what you want. How often have

182
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:39,434
you called technical support and found that the person on the other end really

183
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:42,730
doesn't know how to answer your questions? They've been undertrained,

184
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,170
they're probably overstressed, overworked and underpaid,

185
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,870
and they can't live up to the expectations you have for them.

186
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,226
With many other examples. A car when you're choosing

187
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:57,202
a car, sure, you're thinking about the product health of the car, that is

188
00:11:57,256 --> 00:12:00,958
its functionality, is it top of the line in its features,

189
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:04,642
its fuel economy. You're maybe also

190
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:08,242
thinking about how well does the visions of the car

191
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:12,214
company and what they want to deliver to you match your expectations and

192
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:15,894
what would make you happy. But you also really consider, is this car

193
00:12:15,932 --> 00:12:19,382
reparable? Am I going to be able to find mechanics that know how to fix

194
00:12:19,436 --> 00:12:22,646
it? Am I going to know that the people who I'm

195
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:26,346
going to rely on when my car breaks will be trained enough to

196
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:30,154
know what's going on? Think about your apartment building. An elevator goes

197
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:33,918
out of service. Well, that's immediately a system health issue,

198
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:37,422
but it also becomes a customer happiness issue, that you need to trust

199
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:41,486
that your building understands how debilitating it

200
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:44,880
is to not have elevators, how inconvenient that is,

201
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,042
understands how much of a priority it should be, and that they

202
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:52,562
actually have a function within themselves. There's someone who's either

203
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:56,290
trained to fix it, trained to know who to ask to fix it,

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,054
has the time and the confidence to move

205
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:03,414
this along quickly. If you don't have confidence in all three of these

206
00:13:03,452 --> 00:13:06,966
areas, a lot of these services that we take for granted in

207
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,498
our lives can easily fall apart. So now that we've

208
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:14,410
kind of seen how naturally this definition occurs in the real world,

209
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,802
I want to challenge people and think, why don't we kind of have the same

210
00:13:17,856 --> 00:13:21,054
standards for our technical solutions? Why aren't we

211
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,318
considering the programmers behind the products we choose,

212
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:27,578
the operators that are resolving bugs and incidents,

213
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,406
and generally just understanding that in

214
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:35,294
order to have a good product, there needs to be a confident team of people

215
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:38,898
behind it. So in order to kind of illustrate what this looks like in

216
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:43,006
the tech example and how it can kind of help you strategize and prioritize

217
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:47,042
in terms of improving your products, let's imagine three services,

218
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:50,902
and this is going to be a pretty simplified example. Nothing ever

219
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,726
is so cut and dry in the real world, but hopefully it can illustrate the

220
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:58,534
way that this sort of definition can inform your strategic thinking.

221
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:02,218
So we have three services, a, B and C, and we're going to

222
00:14:02,224 --> 00:14:05,430
look at them in these three buckets of reliability.

223
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:09,114
So in terms of service health, that is all of your

224
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:12,798
typical monitoring metrics. Service A is pretty good. It has a lot

225
00:14:12,804 --> 00:14:16,238
of uptime, it always runs smoothly, it's always returning the

226
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:19,726
correct data. Service B, it's okay, maybe it

227
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:22,902
has the occasional outage, maybe it has some slowdowns,

228
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:26,900
but it's chugging along. And service C, that's bad.

229
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,970
It has frequent major outages, it works inconsistently,

230
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,466
even when people are able to get requests through to

231
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:39,622
it, it's very slow. So you're thinking, all right,

232
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:43,314
I have some free engineering cycles, I want to shore

233
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:46,854
up the problems of my product and make my customers happy.

234
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,618
Which one should I look at first? You're going to say service C,

235
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:54,042
right? That seems like an obvious choice, but let's throw in the next

236
00:14:54,096 --> 00:14:57,654
ingredient and contextualize this based on what are the user

237
00:14:57,782 --> 00:15:01,422
expectations for each of the services. Well,

238
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:04,686
service a, it's kind of popular. It's a feature of

239
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,314
youll product that, let's say around half of your users

240
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:11,098
make use of semi infrequently.

241
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:15,010
It's not super critical for them to enjoy your product,

242
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,194
but it's certainly an expectation they have that

243
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,580
they'll be able to use it when they need to.

244
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,082
Service B is something that's actually in very

245
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:27,842
high demand. It's something that every customer, no matter

246
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:31,734
who they are, no matter what their use cases are, is interacting with and they

247
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:35,250
need it to work or their experience is as good as ruined.

248
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,914
And service C, let's say that's like a brand new feature.

249
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:42,314
It's something that is only being rolled out to certain customers.

250
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:45,814
The usage of it isn't all that high yet, and nobody

251
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:49,498
really is hinging their continued usage of your product

252
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:53,374
on whether or not service C is functioning. So now you're thinking a little

253
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:57,118
differently, right? If you improve service C,

254
00:15:57,204 --> 00:16:01,198
sure, that's great, but maybe not that many customers

255
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:05,346
are even going to notice. It's going to have pretty small returns on

256
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:09,570
your customer satisfaction, whereas a, and especially b,

257
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,014
really do need to see some attention to meet up with these increased

258
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:17,846
customer demands. So now maybe you're thinking,

259
00:16:17,948 --> 00:16:21,526
yeah, service b, that's the one I should take a look at. Finally,

260
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:25,270
let's look at this bucket of sociotechnical resilience.

261
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,098
Service A is a product that is very different

262
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:34,778
than anything else that's offered in your company.

263
00:16:34,944 --> 00:16:38,554
It's something where the engineers aren't that trained, they aren't that

264
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:42,030
prepared. They haven't dealt with many outages of a service

265
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,614
like it. There's not runbooks in place, there's not

266
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:49,322
a typical escalation procedure for it. There's not communications

267
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:53,620
that you've already written up around it. Whereas service B and service C,

268
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:57,922
even though service C is new, it's very closely modeled after

269
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,918
something like service B. And all of your engineers are very confident

270
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:05,714
that they're able to resolve any issues that

271
00:17:05,752 --> 00:17:09,358
arise with it. They've been trained, they've been through it

272
00:17:09,384 --> 00:17:12,678
all before. All of this is kind of old hat to them.

273
00:17:12,844 --> 00:17:16,626
So now you're kind of thinking, well, maybe I should be spending these engineering cycles

274
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:20,374
on shoring up service a proactively, writing some guides

275
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:23,530
on how to fix it. Sure, its system health is good now,

276
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,306
but as demands change and users expectations change,

277
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:31,018
suddenly it could be very unacceptable, and you have

278
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:34,446
to kind of proactively prepare for that. Now, at the end of the

279
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:38,410
day, it's not entirely clear just from this diagram

280
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,950
which service you should prioritize. And obviously, in real life,

281
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,618
things aren't going to be so cut and dry with such clean,

282
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:48,580
single metrics of mid, high or low.

283
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,958
But I hope you can see how this can be a guiding framework

284
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:56,614
to really uncover and highlight where there

285
00:17:56,652 --> 00:18:00,146
are deficiencies. It's not just as simple as looking at monitoring

286
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:04,386
data, but understanding this bigger picture of how things would actually unfold

287
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:05,990
when something breaks.

288
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,038
So when we're talking about these buckets in the technical context,

289
00:18:12,134 --> 00:18:15,494
they're all made up of smaller

290
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:19,002
factors. And usually these are kind of questions you can be asking

291
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:23,010
about your service. So let's break these down a little bit further

292
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,280
in the first bucket, product health. These are the things we know very well.

293
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,066
All the data that comes out of your product as it runs,

294
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:33,730
things that your telemetry is capturing,

295
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:39,950
looking at the stability of the code base. Sometimes it requires some meta analysis,

296
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,034
but all of this sort of like objective, cold data about how

297
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:46,050
your product is actually functioning.

298
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,450
This can be embedded in the program as it runs,

299
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,146
or it can be sort of a more black boxed approach where you're querying

300
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:57,918
your product in a production environment and seeing how well it responds

301
00:18:57,954 --> 00:19:00,826
in terms of latency or the error rate,

302
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:05,082
the traffic you're getting, the saturation of your resources, these being

303
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:08,522
your typical four golden signals. These are

304
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:12,426
all very measurable, very trackable facts

305
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,670
about the way that youll service is functioning.

306
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,150
Customer happiness starts to become a little bit more nuanced,

307
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,890
but it really boils down to, are your customers satisfied?

308
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,866
Is the product healthy enough that they're happy to continue to use it?

309
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:31,090
What does their user experience look like? When we think about

310
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,674
users, it's maybe not so helpful to think about an individual

311
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:38,390
as much as a function. What are the steps that they take

312
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,846
when they use your product? How critical are

313
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:45,654
each of those keeps to their overall satisfaction? What types of

314
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:48,994
steps link together that if one breaks,

315
00:19:49,042 --> 00:19:52,906
another one will break? Breaking down this user journey can really

316
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:56,246
make these questions about user happiness a lot more tangible.

317
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:59,962
You can start putting numbers to them and say, well, the login page

318
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:04,394
has to work 99% of the time in under five milliseconds,

319
00:20:04,522 --> 00:20:08,430
or else users will start feeling like it's too slow or too unstable.

320
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,614
Youll have to really understand this idea of importance. Probably logging

321
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:17,106
in is more important than searching, is more important

322
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:20,100
than adding something to a favorites list.

323
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,806
But there's no universal prescriptive

324
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:27,634
formula to this. It's something that you have to get from your users, from observing

325
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:31,046
their behavior, from surveying them, to build up

326
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:35,446
this kind of statistical understanding of importance. This one is

327
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:39,194
definitely more of a nebulous question. But do they feel confident in your

328
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:42,458
product? Do they feel like it will continue

329
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:46,662
to work to their satisfaction? Does your business have a good reputation

330
00:20:46,726 --> 00:20:49,734
for a reliable product? Do they feel supported,

331
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:53,182
informed? Are there places that they can ask questions? Are there

332
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:56,826
faqs where they can learn about failure modes

333
00:20:56,858 --> 00:21:00,862
and understand what they can expect from the product? Do they feel

334
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,080
connected to you?

335
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,126
Finally, if we look at this sociotechnical resilience bucket,

336
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:12,254
this is where we turn inwards and think about the teams that are operating,

337
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:15,762
supported, improving and developing for

338
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:19,094
your products. So think about when

339
00:21:19,132 --> 00:21:22,806
something goes wrong. How effective is your team? Is there

340
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:26,674
a lot of toilsome work that's repeated every time? Are they moving swiftly?

341
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:30,554
Are they moving effectively? Are they repeating work because

342
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:33,994
there isnt good communication between people and people are trying the same

343
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:37,882
solution independently over and over again. Is there

344
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:40,742
clear service ownership when something goes wrong?

345
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:44,414
Are the right people called in? Is there

346
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:48,058
a clear understanding of who should be the subject matter expert

347
00:21:48,154 --> 00:21:50,560
of who knows the answers to the questions?

348
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,878
Are teams aligned on their priorities and responsibilities?

349
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:59,026
When something breaks, do you have a clear sense of how important it

350
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:02,610
is that it breaks? Is there a clear severity scale and

351
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,260
is there a consistent response that's proportional to that problem?

352
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,194
Are the on call loads balanced? Are there people that are overworked,

353
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:13,874
overstressed? You have to kind of look at this not just through the lens

354
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:17,414
of on call shifts, but the actual expected number

355
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:20,678
of incidents for different types of services, for different teams

356
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:23,994
of different specializations. In the end,

357
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:26,806
you want something that feels fair and transparent,

358
00:22:26,918 --> 00:22:30,140
where everyone feels like they're putting in roughly the same amount of work.

359
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,126
Are people burnt out? Are there too many incidents? Are people

360
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,934
endlessly fighting fires? Do they feel like they're disconnected from the work

361
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:41,834
that they want to do, which is probably more planned,

362
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:45,086
novel feature work? Are people equipped with the

363
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:48,786
tools and knowledge that they need when something breaks, are they scrambling to

364
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:52,510
figure out what to do? Do they have no way of consulting previous

365
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,360
cases? Are there run books in place for them to work through?

366
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,400
Or is everything coming from the top of their head?

367
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,214
And does your team still function if somebody is suddenly away?

368
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:08,680
Are there critical points of singular failure where if

369
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,742
so and so from the login team is missing?

370
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:16,282
Well, they're the only one that understand how that code worked at all.

371
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:20,074
It breaks, nobody else has any clue what they're doing

372
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:23,678
and everything falls into disarray. These are some

373
00:23:23,684 --> 00:23:27,226
of the questions you can start asking yourself to start getting a picture

374
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:30,318
of where your overall reliability is now

375
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:34,034
with this new definition. And it's in this last bucket that

376
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:37,842
we really want people to focus because the first two things,

377
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:41,902
I think most organizations already have some function to capture.

378
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:45,266
But this looking inwards and really understanding, what are

379
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:49,046
the stress points for your teams? Where do your teams feel confident and

380
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:52,326
where do they feel insecure? That takes a lot

381
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,978
of deliberate work, a lot of reflection,

382
00:23:55,154 --> 00:23:57,720
and should really motivate a lot of change.

383
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,746
And what does it do for you once you're kind of aligned on?

384
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:06,566
We really should prioritize looking at these three buckets.

385
00:24:06,758 --> 00:24:10,506
What benefits should you expect to get from this alignment

386
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:13,520
on reliability? Well, first off,

387
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,374
the value of just aligning in the first place is huge.

388
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:22,026
So often in this world of distributed teams and microservices,

389
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:25,778
where system architecture is so complex, it creates a

390
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:29,506
lot of inconsistent communication, prioritization and

391
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:33,950
understanding between different teams. But if you have the singular definition

392
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,606
that any incident can be viewed in the lens of where

393
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:41,206
you're constantly thinking about what is the overall impact on our

394
00:24:41,228 --> 00:24:45,602
product's health, what is the impact of that on our customers happiness,

395
00:24:45,746 --> 00:24:48,886
and how equipped are our teams to remedy that.

396
00:24:49,068 --> 00:24:52,346
All different issues across all services can be kind of

397
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:56,106
put into this one singular language which creates a whole

398
00:24:56,128 --> 00:25:00,006
lot more of an alignment, motivation and engagement to improve these

399
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:04,302
things. These motivation for impactful changes

400
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:08,426
is also absolutely huge because it's

401
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:11,934
sometimes hard to get your teams to want

402
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:15,954
to invest in reliability. There is an eagerness to want to

403
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:18,990
launch new features, to gain that competitive edge,

404
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,134
to get ahead of competitors on having all the latest

405
00:25:23,182 --> 00:25:26,722
and greatest tech. But by showing

406
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:30,806
that this definition links into the

407
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,640
health of your product, the happiness of your customers,

408
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,054
and the confidence and capability of your teams, it becomes

409
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:40,940
clear, like what could really be more important than that?

410
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,946
Finally, it prioritizes where these changes are

411
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:49,450
needed by turning the question of is our product

412
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,454
reliable? Into something that's a lot more measurable, that's a lot more

413
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:56,510
monitorable, that's easier to assess.

414
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:01,018
It creates a situation where you can see what improving reliability

415
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:04,862
actually looks like in practice. It's not just this sort of vague

416
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:08,350
goal of let's make our product more reliable,

417
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,434
but it'll show you the clear outages of we need

418
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:15,990
to fix this so it meets customer expectations. We need to trained

419
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,190
this team so we don't have another twelve hour outage.

420
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,426
It points you towards the changes that are most impactful

421
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:24,840
and needed most.

422
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:30,374
So I mentioned a lot that one of the goals of thinking reliability

423
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,938
like this is that it makes it more measurable, it transforms it into something

424
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:38,730
quantitative from something totally qualitative.

425
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,326
And how you do that exactly will vary a lot from organization to

426
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,682
organization. But what we think this definition outages

427
00:26:46,746 --> 00:26:50,202
a lot of is sort of a question and answer format

428
00:26:50,346 --> 00:26:53,386
that points you to the numbers that will be most valuable.

429
00:26:53,498 --> 00:26:56,802
So here's some examples you can think about.

430
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:59,950
What are the sources of manual labor for each type of incident?

431
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,358
Think about all of your most common types of outages

432
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:06,834
or slowdowns or errors or whatever.

433
00:27:07,032 --> 00:27:10,098
When those things happen and they're being resolved,

434
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:13,174
where is there a lot of toil? Where is there a lot of steps being

435
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:16,694
taken manually? You can look at

436
00:27:16,732 --> 00:27:20,602
each of your engineers that work on call and think about how many hours

437
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:24,086
have they spent actually in the trenches of responding

438
00:27:24,118 --> 00:27:27,722
to incidents, not just on call shifts, but actual on call

439
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:31,126
work where they were paged and had to suddenly

440
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:34,814
jump to their computer. How much time has your

441
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:37,934
team spent fixing each service? Think about all your

442
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:41,790
different service types and just come up with a total number of hours

443
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,406
spent fixing them. So it's not always trivial to

444
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:48,606
get these numbers. It's not like there's going to be a program that can spit

445
00:27:48,638 --> 00:27:51,954
them out for you. And it's not like these numbers will actually tell

446
00:27:51,992 --> 00:27:55,330
you the entire story, but instead it's in the process

447
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,710
of gathering this data and having these conversations

448
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:02,950
that you can start to really figure out where your strategic priorities should lie.

449
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:06,422
So let's say you're trying to

450
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,846
list off all the different sources of manual labor for each type of

451
00:28:09,868 --> 00:28:12,540
incident. And one has a lot.

452
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,874
Oh, jeez. This thing, it goes down every couple of weeks. And every

453
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:20,138
time it does, we have to do this, we have to restart that, we have

454
00:28:20,144 --> 00:28:24,206
to run this script, we have to coordinate with this guy, that guy has

455
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:27,614
to run this script. It becomes very

456
00:28:27,652 --> 00:28:31,546
tedious and toilsome. And once you're starting to tabulate these lists,

457
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:34,846
once you're starting to quantify it, that leaps right out. You can see

458
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:37,986
that that's an outlier and you should go, yes, it's time to

459
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,426
invest in automating this. When you're looking at the number

460
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:44,642
of incident hours, you can see easily, wow,

461
00:28:44,696 --> 00:28:48,134
the team for this incident type is always busy. We should

462
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:51,862
consider investing a few more people into this to

463
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:55,446
pick up that slack, to make

464
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:58,634
sure that there's nothing slipping through the cracks, to make sure this

465
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:02,010
team isnt going to get burnt out. Once again,

466
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,914
just trying to quantify things tells you this story that you can

467
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,786
investigate further. And this

468
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:13,086
one, every time you log some hours on

469
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:15,678
a service, fixing it, repairing it,

470
00:29:15,844 --> 00:29:20,190
upgrading it, you become more experienced with it, you become more confident,

471
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,966
you're capable of dealing with a greater range of issues that

472
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:27,262
can emerge from it. So if you find an outlier, again,

473
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:30,786
where, geez, this service, thankfully, it hasn't gone down much

474
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:34,850
at all, because our teams have really no experience at all in fixing it.

475
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,326
That's a sign that maybe you should proactively practice. You can run some

476
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:41,666
drills, you can write some runbooks, you can prepare resources

477
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:45,494
and processes that will get people confident even

478
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:48,410
in the absence of the real world crisis.

479
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,306
So measuring this thing, this brand new definition of

480
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:57,642
reliability, it isn't trivial. It's something that varies from

481
00:29:57,696 --> 00:30:01,162
organization, from product, but it's something

482
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,766
that's really worth investing your time in. And the goal, again, isn't to

483
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:08,126
come up with one magic formula that answers every question,

484
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:11,550
but to reveal what the right questions are,

485
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,426
to find outliers and to decide priorities in the

486
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:18,820
process of investigating the numbers behind them.

487
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:23,294
So, in conclusion, our new definition

488
00:30:23,342 --> 00:30:26,710
of reliability is your system's health that we know

489
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,722
very well, contextualized by the expectations

490
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:33,720
of your users, what are adequate numbers?

491
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,614
And then prioritize based on your engineer sociotechnical

492
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:42,074
resilience. Where do they have confidence and where do they

493
00:30:42,112 --> 00:30:46,010
need trained and help in order to keep everything running smoothly.

494
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,806
Here are a few citations around the cost

495
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:55,146
of downtime in tech companies and also the crises among

496
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:58,814
airlines last holiday season, so feel

497
00:30:58,852 --> 00:31:02,334
free to investigate that further if you want to see just

498
00:31:02,372 --> 00:31:05,822
how important this question has become to so many

499
00:31:05,876 --> 00:31:09,918
organizations. But I hope you've enjoyed my talk.

500
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:13,326
I hope I've opened your eyes to a new way of

501
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:17,234
thinking about reliability and motivated you into investing

502
00:31:17,282 --> 00:31:20,898
some serious time into building up that practice

503
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:23,942
in your organization, too. Have a wonderful day.

504
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:24,802
I've been Emily,
