00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,994
Hi there. This is Arfad. Today I'll

2
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:01,470
talk about how to be a digital nomad without

3
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,010
losing your job. I'm going to give you a small tour,

4
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,334
more of my life as a digital nomad, and also bring

5
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:12,566
in the bigger philosophy of why I choose to live this

6
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:16,166
way. So before I start this talk, let me tell you a little bit

7
00:02:16,188 --> 00:02:19,718
about me. I'm a production engineer at Shopify,

8
00:02:19,894 --> 00:02:23,430
which is like being a DevOps engineer. So I do terraform,

9
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,206
kubernetes, system stuff, and a lot of other buzzwordy

10
00:02:27,238 --> 00:02:30,358
stuff. Aside from my job, during the summer,

11
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:34,186
I'm a hiker, and I really, really love the mountains.

12
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,978
So during the wanted, I am a skier and a snowboarder,

13
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:41,306
and I'm also learning how to surf.

14
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:44,382
And aside from that, I'm an avid traveler.

15
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:47,970
So I've been to many countries, and I'm always

16
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,420
looking for recommendations for cooler and newer places to travel to.

17
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,466
Since this talk is about traveling, I want to

18
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:59,030
mention that there's two kinds of traveling.

19
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,938
So the first kind of traveling is the one where you have new experiences

20
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:07,702
and you experience the joy and the aha. Moment of seeing

21
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:11,354
something new and novel for the very first time in your life.

22
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:15,254
So imagine if you're looking at the pyramids of Giza

23
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:19,094
or if you're looking at the Eiffel Tower. Just the sheer

24
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:22,666
bliss of, like, oh, my God, I'm seeing something new for the first time.

25
00:03:22,848 --> 00:03:26,190
That's amazing. And that takes your breath away. And that's usually

26
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,166
what we think of when we think of the word traveling. We think of it

27
00:03:29,188 --> 00:03:32,954
as, like, seeing new things. But there's another kind of traveling.

28
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:36,434
And this kind of traveling is the ability to see the same

29
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:40,414
things you're always seeing, but with a different outlook. So imagine

30
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,426
if you're in a relationship with a person for many years,

31
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:47,186
and even after all these years, you learn something new about them,

32
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:50,626
and you get so surprised, like, oh, my God, I still can't

33
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:54,006
believe I'm learning something new about this person. Or imagine if

34
00:03:54,028 --> 00:03:57,766
you're going to an office and you've been doing the same drive to

35
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:01,354
your office for, like, 80 years, and on

36
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:04,762
this time, on this new day, instead of taking

37
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:08,234
the same old drive, you took a different route, or maybe you played a new

38
00:04:08,272 --> 00:04:12,302
song, and somehow it becomes just a bit more joyful and cheerful because

39
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:15,486
you did the same thing you do every day, but you did it with a

40
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:19,358
different frame and you had a better fun

41
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,600
doing it. So,

42
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,090
ideally, my goal in life is to inspire people to learn

43
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,634
to do the second kind of traveling, because if you do that, then no matter

44
00:04:29,672 --> 00:04:33,234
where you are and what you're doing in life, there's always an

45
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:37,250
element of spontaneity and joy that comes with the newness of

46
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,530
seeing new experiences. It's the ability to inject

47
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,720
spontaneity and novelty in anything that you're doing.

48
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,520
However, in the interest of time,

49
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,786
this talk is about the first kind of traveling,

50
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:54,154
where you learn to have novel experiences in your life while still

51
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:57,706
trying to maintain your job, your physical health, your mental health,

52
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:01,150
and you have to do all of these things without breaking a buck.

53
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,646
Fortunately, we are in a place where we

54
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:08,942
are extremely blessed with our abilities as

55
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:12,430
skilled programmers, managers, DevOps engineers.

56
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,658
We are in a unique place in history where we can use our work

57
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:20,766
to work remotely. And remote work is something that's considered

58
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:24,510
not only acceptable, in fact, it's even encouraged

59
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,006
in our workforce. And it's time that we take

60
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,206
the full advantage of this opportunity to travel and

61
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:34,870
explore the world while still maintaining our jobs.

62
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,742
So I sort of gave you the main idea that, yeah, traveling is cool,

63
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,186
traveling is fun, it's an amazing experience, and we should all do it.

64
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:46,234
But I'm also going to highlight a bigger question of why we should be

65
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:49,434
doing it. So instead of giving you all my

66
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:53,326
lessons in kind of like a package sort of a way, how about I give

67
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:56,574
you a story? A story that I actually went through myself.

68
00:05:56,772 --> 00:06:00,478
And then as I followed through my own story, I would offer

69
00:06:00,564 --> 00:06:03,954
different lessons, which I learned by randomly stumbling upon and

70
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:06,980
trying out many different things in my own life.

71
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,954
So here it goes. So 2020,

72
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:16,206
that was a very hard year for all of us. It changed

73
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:19,814
my life for the better in some ways, and also for the

74
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:23,446
worse in other ways. I had a roller coaster of

75
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:27,206
a ride. You see, at the start of the year,

76
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:30,198
I used to live in this cute little town called Ottawa.

77
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:33,706
Ottawa is the capital of Canada. And I was

78
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:37,466
working in the beautiful offices of Shopify in

79
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:40,874
Ottawa. And I had a very fun life full of

80
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:44,206
friends and coworkers. And we would. We would

81
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:47,786
meet up every day, we would hang out, we would play games,

82
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:51,530
we would go to parties together. We would have so many get togethers,

83
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,182
and we would do cooking, tech conferences, everything.

84
00:06:55,236 --> 00:06:59,246
We would do all kinds of things. And I honestly felt so connected

85
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,706
to people and had such a fun life. So I've been

86
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:06,082
a very social person, and just the joy and the camaraderie

87
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:09,640
of being around people makes me very happy

88
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,626
now. March 2020. The COVID

89
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:18,358
happens. When the COVID happened, it was

90
00:07:18,524 --> 00:07:22,810
quite a shocker for me. I was actually in complete denial.

91
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,666
I was still going to my gym. I literally turned off all the

92
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:29,878
news sources that were hitting me because I lived

93
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:33,546
by myself and I wanted to maintain my mental

94
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,846
health. For the first few days of

95
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:40,880
work from home, I was like, this thing is going to end.

96
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,590
This has to end. And when this ends,

97
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,498
I'm going to go back to my office, to my friends. We're going to

98
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:51,666
have these fancy lunches. We're going to chill out. We're going to make fun of

99
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:55,586
this. And we all know how that turned out so well.

100
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:59,634
That's life now. Different people deal with different things differently.

101
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:03,046
But for me, this was a complete turnover. I was

102
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,438
a very social person. And the feeling of being around people

103
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,962
and vibing with people is something that's very important to me.

104
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:13,994
So to revamp everything by myself was too much

105
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,674
work. It was a shocker, but I had

106
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:21,120
to adapt. So as months went on,

107
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,262
I realized that the emotions of the shock of COVID finally

108
00:08:25,316 --> 00:08:28,574
faded away. And I was slowly adapting to the new

109
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:31,040
lifestyle of remote work.

110
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,374
I was very methodical, very calculated. I would take

111
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:39,086
good care of my health. I would always work out. I would always be diligent

112
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,546
with my work. And I had a very appropriate work from

113
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,980
home set up to take care of the work stuff.

114
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,622
Things were actually going fine for a couple of months until I

115
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:54,470
woke up one day and started having serious troubles in my relationships.

116
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,254
You see, what happened was both my dad

117
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:03,162
and my sister got really sick. They had

118
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:07,446
Covid and they all live in India. And meanwhile,

119
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:10,666
here I was in Canada, thousands and thousands of miles

120
00:09:10,698 --> 00:09:14,014
away from my family. And I couldn't help

121
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:17,326
them. I was completely incapable of doing anything

122
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,574
to help and support them. And that, to me,

123
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:24,402
was extremely stressful because I really want

124
00:09:24,456 --> 00:09:27,090
my family to be safe and healthy.

125
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,150
And aside from that, the rest of my social circle

126
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,578
was kind of drowning out day by day.

127
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:38,534
So people were moving to different cities, people were switching jobs. So pretty

128
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:41,890
soon I felt this pain of isolation

129
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,750
like I'd never felt before. And I really

130
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,414
wanted to get past it. I actually

131
00:09:49,612 --> 00:09:53,574
felt like this guy, to be honest. It's like the guy hearing,

132
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:56,538
like, a bad news over the phone. That was me. I was hearing quite a

133
00:09:56,544 --> 00:10:00,042
few bad news over the phone. And to be honest,

134
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:04,426
those were not good times for me. And that's

135
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:08,346
kind of how my story starts. It starts from a rather dark

136
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:12,078
places of escapism. I was having a hard time

137
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:16,130
dealing with stuff. And it turned me into someone who

138
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,634
wanted a coping mechanism to deal with

139
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:23,714
stuff. And fortunately for me, there comes

140
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,574
this ski season. So as I've told you before, I'm a good

141
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:32,534
skier and skiing is my saving grace. So I

142
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:36,466
used to go to these ski hills called Mothamblan.

143
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:39,706
It's a beautiful ski resort in Quebec. This is

144
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,194
an actual photo of the ski hills that I

145
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:46,858
used to go to. It's a beautiful place. It's basically straight out

146
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,542
of Narnia. And I love skiing.

147
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:52,926
So at the time it was a release from all the

148
00:10:52,948 --> 00:10:56,106
stresses and the isolation that I was feeling.

149
00:10:56,298 --> 00:11:00,254
It was a two hour drive from my city of Ottawa to Motombla and

150
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,518
back. So whenever I

151
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:06,958
went skiing, I always used to stay at this hostel

152
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,962
and I really enjoyed my time there. I even made some friends with other

153
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:14,770
people. I was finally able to connect with other people,

154
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,158
share the things that kind of made me very uncomfortable about

155
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:22,806
my family's illness and those kind of things. And slowly and

156
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:26,166
gradually, the emotional stability and the connection that I

157
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,514
was missing that was actually gained back by

158
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:33,114
connecting with people, with other skiers, other friends.

159
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:37,494
And I think that to me was the most important thing. Not just skiing,

160
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,594
not just the beautiful views, not just know, living in basically Narnia.

161
00:11:41,722 --> 00:11:45,246
It's actually meeting with people, having fun with them, making memories and

162
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:48,654
connecting with them. And that helped me

163
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:51,966
cope with the stress of my family stuff.

164
00:11:52,148 --> 00:11:55,682
Very fortunately, over the next couple of weeks,

165
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:59,230
both my dad and my sister recovered from COVID

166
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,610
They are perfectly fine and they're fine now.

167
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,326
So that's a good thing. And I had some new friends to hang out

168
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:10,086
with. So that's a great news for me. So just

169
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:13,990
to keep the momentum, I actually started going to Mothamblan

170
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,080
almost every weekend and staying over.

171
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,286
Things are looking pretty good. And one day when I was

172
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,442
at the hostel, they hit me that I come here

173
00:12:24,496 --> 00:12:28,554
so often. I really like living here and there's really

174
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,898
no obligation for me know, take the journey back

175
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:35,902
to Ottawa and go there. So at this point I'd become

176
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:39,534
good friends with the people who live there. So one day I basically went

177
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:43,626
to the owner of the hostel. His name was Matthew. So I'm talking to Matthew

178
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:46,894
and I told know if

179
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,690
I, if I go on booking.com

180
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,626
and book this hostel for an entire month, it's going

181
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,980
to cost me like $3,600.

182
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,446
That's a lot of money for me at the time and

183
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:05,334
I think that might be a little too much for me. But what

184
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,546
happens if I just pay you straight out of pocket?

185
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,782
However much you want, you can make a rental agreement you can take cash however

186
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:15,606
much you want, and then I pay you and you let me stay for a

187
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,438
month. And this was kind of a strange request. It's like it was two in

188
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:21,246
the face. It was kind of a surprising. So told him, hey, man, take your

189
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,814
time. Take your time. Think about this. You don't have to answer me

190
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:28,606
right now. So the next day, he comes back and he

191
00:13:28,628 --> 00:13:31,342
says, $1,200. And that was like,

192
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:34,926
bam. It's basically like one third of

193
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:37,774
the price that I was seeing on booking.com.

194
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:41,490
So I listened to this. I'm just ecstatic. I'm happy

195
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,266
as a person could be. And I pack up all my

196
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:48,546
stuff. I go back to auto, I pack up all my stuff. I take

197
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,942
it all in, and next thing you know is I'm moving over and actually

198
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:55,138
living in a ski resort. I set up my work desk.

199
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:58,914
I set up my entire workplace and everything I negotiated

200
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:02,570
with my employer that, hey, I'll be working from here,

201
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,506
and I'll be sticking to these particular work hours and focus on my

202
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:10,366
work in those work hours. And aside from that, I'll be skiing in

203
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:13,182
the morning or after work and stuff like that.

204
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:17,022
And those were some pretty happy

205
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:20,378
times for me. So this brings

206
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:24,086
us to the first rule of digital nomadism. You can literally

207
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:27,906
live anywhere. Anywhere. Literally anywhere, as long as you learn

208
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:31,426
how to negotiate. So I never knew in my life that

209
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:34,722
you could work from a ski resort and

210
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:38,738
set up a workspace there. But I randomly stumbled upon it because

211
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:42,646
I was going through some dark times. And I did it for two months

212
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:46,134
before the partying and the fun got the better of me and had to stop.

213
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:50,202
But that's a story for another day. So over time,

214
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:54,314
I learned this special technique for living in places. And I

215
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,478
learned that I could literally start messaging random hotels,

216
00:14:57,574 --> 00:15:00,986
outhouses, Airbnbs, anywhere which

217
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:04,074
has a house which has an empty space. I can just send

218
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:08,206
them, like, a fancy email telling them a little bit about me, what I do.

219
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:11,838
And I would set up a call with them once. I would be on a

220
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,922
call with them, I would have a nice and a friendly conversation.

221
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:17,940
I would tell them about my background, and I ask them like, hey,

222
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,420
can I stay here for, like, two months? And I'll pay you in cash

223
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,910
or whatever form that works for you. We can make a rental agreement. We can

224
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,846
do it online, however it works for you. And this interesting thing

225
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:35,800
is that most of the times, people actually get baffled because

226
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,702
it's a strange request for places which are not used to working

227
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:43,354
like a rental place. And they would give me, like, 50% to 60%

228
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:46,714
off simply because I asked. And the reason they would give me that

229
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:50,474
is because they would much rather have a nice tenant who takes

230
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:53,834
care of the place and pays them consistently, rather than

231
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:56,746
sorting through all these people every weekend,

232
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:00,174
making a filter, figuring out if this is the right person or

233
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:03,166
not. They would much rather give it to someone who could just take care of

234
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:06,946
it and pay them money. So that's how I got a lot of

235
00:16:06,968 --> 00:16:10,814
discounts down the line. Now, there comes a second lesson

236
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:14,786
here. And in order to understand this lesson, I have to introduce you

237
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,040
with another story.

238
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,720
Here it goes.

239
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:26,326
When I was at my company as an intern, I knew this guy

240
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:30,266
back in the day. He was a very interesting guy. He joined as

241
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:34,842
an intern at my company at the age of 36.

242
00:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,958
He was pretty late in starting his tech career,

243
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:41,558
and I asked him about his journey, and he said that when he

244
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,846
was younger, he spent a couple of years learning how

245
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:48,126
to farm in Kenya. And then he came back

246
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:51,374
to Canada. He found a very large piece of

247
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:54,950
land in Surrey, in Vancouver, for the purpose

248
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,690
of agriculture farming, and he leased it for two years

249
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,306
to do some organic farming. Now, for those of you

250
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:05,378
who are unaware of the canadian housing and the property market,

251
00:17:05,464 --> 00:17:08,966
Surrey is a part of Vancouver, which happens to be one of

252
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:12,454
the most expensive real estate areas in Canada and quite

253
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:16,086
possibly the world. So now, naturally, the question comes that

254
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:19,738
if he did farming in such an expensive real estate area,

255
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:23,642
how did he get the money for it? So I asked him

256
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:26,778
about it, and he said,

257
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:30,410
I basically looked for, like, an old farmed land,

258
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,522
which was just, like, looking like it was deserted, it was dilapidated,

259
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:38,154
it was just collecting dust. And he found the owner,

260
00:17:38,282 --> 00:17:42,046
and he contacted him, and he promised him that he would lease this land

261
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:46,026
and make it the best organic farm in Vancouver. He's very skilled,

262
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:49,746
and he wants to make this great organic farm. And the

263
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:53,394
owner is always welcome to take any of the fresh produce from the farm for

264
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:56,982
free. So there was a lot of back and forth between

265
00:17:57,036 --> 00:18:00,694
him and the owner of the land, and he ended up

266
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:03,480
becoming close friends with the owner of the land.

267
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,590
Now, the crazy part is that when he finally

268
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,970
signed the lease, the lease was for just one dollars,

269
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,182
because that was the minimum legal amount of lease that was permitted

270
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:17,322
at the time. And that's insane, right?

271
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:20,634
Imagine signing the lease of an expensive land for literally just

272
00:18:20,672 --> 00:18:23,998
one dollars because you become friends with the owner of

273
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:27,406
the place where you're working at. And I think that kind

274
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:31,182
of shows you something very important that in any business, deal in any

275
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,942
contract. It's just a contract between two people who are willing

276
00:18:35,006 --> 00:18:38,226
participants. So if there's only one

277
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:41,586
thing, if there's only one thing that you can take from this entire talk

278
00:18:41,768 --> 00:18:45,010
is that never be afraid to ask for the absurd.

279
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,858
Whether it's like a hotel where you want to live at, whether it's an Airbnb,

280
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:54,120
whether you're buying a car from a rental dealership or whatever,

281
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,114
always ask the absurd. Just it's

282
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:01,258
never be afraid to ask people for something that you want, whether you want

283
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:04,634
to ask someone out on a date, whether you want to ask someone out for

284
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:08,474
some help that you need. The absolute worst that someone can

285
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:12,678
say is no. So become closer

286
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,142
to people, and don't do this in sort of like a manipulative way, but more

287
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,662
in sort of like, I got to shoot my shot. Let's see what happens.

288
00:19:19,716 --> 00:19:23,166
Let's see how it goes. So I'll give you an example of why this

289
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:27,234
works in traveling. You see, the thing that happens in traveling is

290
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:30,354
that most of the places that, the fancy places that you look

291
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:33,550
out for, they actually make their money during the peak season.

292
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,450
So most hotels, Airbnbs, hostels,

293
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,646
they mainly make their money during weekends. So if you

294
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,766
can go ahead and ask them, like, hey, if I were to stay here for

295
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:47,238
a month, can you give me a special rate? Often they'll come up

296
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:51,226
with a rate that's 50% to 60% cheaper than online booking for the entire

297
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:55,194
period of the place. And oftentimes you can even negotiate them

298
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:58,234
further down from the rate that they first give you.

299
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:02,762
And in my history, I found places which charge like $200

300
00:20:02,816 --> 00:20:06,062
a night on the weekend. But if you take them for the entire month,

301
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:09,486
they'll give you one, $200. So that's like an 80% discount from

302
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:12,800
the monthly price of individually booking something online.

303
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,262
And the reasoning is actually very simple. Rather than finding

304
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:20,978
every new person every other weekend, sorting through people,

305
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:24,146
filtering, doing all that shebang, and then hoping that they

306
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:28,474
don't ruin your place, they would much rather have a decent working professional

307
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:32,134
who can just take care of the place, stays there for the entire month,

308
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,746
and they don't have to think about it. So I've

309
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:38,614
literally had calls to the Airbnbs where I told them,

310
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:41,354
hey, I know that Airbnbs are for short term stay,

311
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:45,322
but instead of staying here for short term, how about we make this instead

312
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:48,774
of booking through Airbnbs, can we just do it like a rental

313
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:52,394
agreement for a longer term? And I could stay here,

314
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:55,630
and they would often offer me, like 40% of the monthly price.

315
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,894
Anything that we be terminals that we use online, like booking.com,

316
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:02,800
Airbnbs, all of those things. They're kind of middlemen. They always charge you so much.

317
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,926
First thing you can do is you can remove the middleman. Second thing you can

318
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:10,306
do is you can tell them, hey, I'm staying for a longer period, just give

319
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:13,026
me a better rate. And the worst thing that could happen is people say no

320
00:21:13,048 --> 00:21:16,274
or not give you something you want, but at least you ask.

321
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:18,470
Truth is, there are no rules.

322
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,694
You can get the best deal just depending on how smart you are

323
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:26,258
with negotiation. Now, let's start off with the third rule

324
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:30,200
of digital nomadism. One of the points

325
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,962
of friction that I always learn in the stories of people

326
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:37,466
who are digital nomads is that they want to be like,

327
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:40,934
they would search, they would google for how to be a digital nomad in Portugal,

328
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:44,606
how to be a digital nomad in South America or something like

329
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:48,842
that. And they would look at the search results and they would find these fancy

330
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:52,430
places which are like, this is set up for remote work. This has

331
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,190
a fastest wifi, this has a swimming pool, this has a massage area.

332
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,682
This has like a spa. This has all the amenities that you could need.

333
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,498
And you find these places, but then you would actually look at the price and

334
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:04,818
it would be like $7,000 a month.

335
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:08,674
So it would be like you could find like a fancy paradise of

336
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:12,018
remote work. Then you look at the price, you realize this is insane,

337
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:15,398
and then it kind of nudges you in the direction of

338
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,990
just, why bother doing this? It's too expensive.

339
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,502
And the truth is that you don't need these fancy

340
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:26,054
resorts to live at. You can always find much cheaper

341
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:29,370
options. If you're willing to go retro, if you're willing to go on your own,

342
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,910
you can always find much cheaper options by yourself. So,

343
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,686
for example, imagine if you want to move to a

344
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,600
new city and you're looking for, say,

345
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,718
a new apartment where you could work from. Now, if you

346
00:22:44,804 --> 00:22:48,002
find an apartment that does everything, but it just doesn't fit into

347
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:52,034
the requirement of, like, I need a good desk, I need

348
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:55,362
a good place to take calls and all those kind of things.

349
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:59,798
What you can always do is that you can pair up your membership with

350
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:03,206
a membership of a remote workplace office. So like

351
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:07,462
a co working space. And the reason that is super helpful is

352
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:10,966
because you can always have a fine place to

353
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:14,314
work from, which would be your co working space, and then you can stay at

354
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,702
any crappy place that works just enough for you to sleep.

355
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:21,354
So that's kind of how I did. It's like I would

356
00:23:21,392 --> 00:23:25,326
find any place that's good enough for me to

357
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:28,766
stay at or to sleep at, and that doesn't have to be expensive. And then

358
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:32,654
I would pair it with a remote work membership, and that

359
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:36,242
way you can have the best of both worlds where your place of stay

360
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:40,066
doesn't have to satisfy all the constraints, but it is good enough for

361
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:44,050
you just to survive. So moving

362
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,282
on to the next part of my journey.

363
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,758
So we learned some few good lessons from the first part of

364
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,190
the journey. So after I was staying in Mothamla,

365
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,410
I had some couple of really amazing experiences and

366
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,454
I had a good time, I got to be honest. But I realized

367
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:07,322
it wasn't very conducive to being productive at work.

368
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:11,194
And I had to decide to move back to

369
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:14,394
a more normal lifestyle where I was living in a normal

370
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:18,174
household. And I wanted to experience the joys of the

371
00:24:18,212 --> 00:24:21,550
boring life without the ski bumps and the adventure.

372
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,170
So I moved to Vancouver, which is another

373
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,366
city, which is way far off in the west coast.

374
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,434
I literally found like an Airbnb. I negotiated a month

375
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,758
of stay for lesser price than the original price. So the original

376
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,886
price was 1100. I negotiated up to 700.

377
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:42,930
And that's pretty low for Vancouver. And Vancouver

378
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,114
is a beautiful place that's very close to my herd.

379
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:49,674
And I just wanted to stay here because I wanted to explore this

380
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:53,482
beautiful city. And this is like an actual photo of

381
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:56,998
Vancouver. So for those of you don't

382
00:24:57,014 --> 00:25:00,774
know, this was actually a large move. You see, Ottawa and Vancouver

383
00:25:00,822 --> 00:25:04,622
are basically a country apart. They're like 3000 km away

384
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:08,430
from each other. So I had to take a long five hour flight

385
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,306
in order to move from Ottawa all the way back to Vancouver.

386
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:17,102
And I understand that some of my behavior here

387
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:21,086
screams of like male tecboro energy. I get it. But I can assure

388
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:24,306
you other people can do this too. And that's probably why

389
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:27,906
I'm giving this talk. Anyway. So I was flying

390
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:31,350
all the way across the country and I

391
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,030
had to give up literally most of the things that I owned because

392
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,934
I only needed the bare minimum stuff that I needed with me

393
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:42,006
and I had to give away all the best of the stuff that I didn't

394
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:45,766
need. So in the end, the end result was something like this photo.

395
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:49,546
So this is a photo of everything I owned. When I

396
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,022
arrived at Vancouver airport. I ended up giving

397
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:56,606
away all my possessions and everything I

398
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:59,854
didn't need. And in the end, all I was left with was

399
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,490
just two bags for some nice fancy clothes. My laptop,

400
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,194
my ski bag, which is to keep my skis and some

401
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:11,522
clothes and then my ski boots, and that's it.

402
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:14,580
I gave away my bike. I literally sold it.

403
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,718
I had another bag that I gave away, and I gave away a lot of

404
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:23,718
stuff that I just didn't need because I wanted to be free

405
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:27,526
and travel more. So this brings us to the fourth rule of

406
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:30,850
digital nomadism, which is minimalism

407
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,114
is very hard, but it's worth it. The way I arrived at this is

408
00:26:35,152 --> 00:26:38,490
that I made a list. I made like a noted list

409
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,958
of everything that I could possibly use in my journey.

410
00:26:42,054 --> 00:26:45,514
So whether it was a toothbrush, whether it was my laptop,

411
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,214
whether it was my slippers, anything that I use twice or twice a day,

412
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:52,926
it's very clear that I actually need it. But if it's something that I

413
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:56,446
don't need, like a candle or like a yoga

414
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:59,634
mat or something, I'll keep it on the list, but I'll make sure that I

415
00:26:59,672 --> 00:27:03,938
note that I don't actually use this thing, even though I own it.

416
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:07,490
And that way I kind of came up with a list of, finally,

417
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,534
the things that I actually use once or twice a week, twice a week,

418
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:14,102
every day. And I just restricted myself to only having

419
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:17,734
those things, and I just gave up all of the other things away.

420
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:21,194
So you don't have to go as far as I did. You can do a

421
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:25,014
much smaller version of this in your own, in which you're

422
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:29,242
exploring something for, say, a week or two, and you're going for a short

423
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,918
trip. And in the short trip, you realize what you need and what

424
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:36,880
you don't need, and you just stick to the bare minimum of what you need.

425
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,938
So this brings us to the next rule,

426
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:45,054
and this is kind of a pivot here, which is that the part

427
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:48,594
of making lists is important, and you can use that for any other kind of

428
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:52,850
problems, too. So when I had to move to Vancouver,

429
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,406
I was become more and more familiar with myself, what I like and I

430
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:02,470
didn't like. And that made me realize that

431
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,786
every time I'm searching for apartments, every time I'm searching for rental agreements,

432
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,820
I can always write them down as a list problem.

433
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,766
And this is very particular for rental

434
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:17,046
agreements, but it applies to many other areas

435
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:20,586
of life, too. So what I would do is I would make a

436
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,606
list, and I would make a list of all the things I absolutely need in

437
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:28,078
a place or all the things I absolutely need to own. And then I

438
00:28:28,084 --> 00:28:31,326
would keep refining and pruning that list over months and months and

439
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:34,970
years, so it becomes much easier for me to

440
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,386
use that list and to make it applicable. So for

441
00:28:38,408 --> 00:28:41,746
example, take a look at this. This is my list for what

442
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:46,386
kind of apartment that I need. So here I

443
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:49,778
have defined all the kind of boundary conditions that I needed, an apartment that the

444
00:28:49,784 --> 00:28:53,206
monthly rent could be from 900 to 1300. It has to be furnished, it has

445
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:57,014
to have a decent wifi, I have to have a flexible agreement from month

446
00:28:57,052 --> 00:29:00,586
to month. So based on this list, I kind

447
00:29:00,608 --> 00:29:05,062
of made like a template email message that I always used to send to Airbnbs

448
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:08,746
and to landlords. And I use these kind

449
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:12,958
of lists to help me kind of find newer things

450
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:16,734
and to make me realize that

451
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:21,018
I become very essentialist. I follow essentialism,

452
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:24,594
which is the idea that you only use the bare minimum of

453
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:28,386
exactly what you need and don't focus on the extraneous information and

454
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:32,018
the redundant stuff. So that is the

455
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:35,330
fifth rule. Write down apartment search as an optimization problem,

456
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,126
meaning write it down as a list and then satisfy the constraints of

457
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:42,834
the list. Now this is a 6th rule.

458
00:29:42,962 --> 00:29:46,022
This is one of the major caveat that I didn't mention before,

459
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:49,414
and the reason I didn't mention is because it's actually quite hard to talk

460
00:29:49,452 --> 00:29:53,194
about it, is that one thing I want to warn you people

461
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:55,914
is that no matter what you do, no matter what kind of exploration you do,

462
00:29:55,952 --> 00:30:00,006
always do things in a legal manner. Don't skate around the legal logistics,

463
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:04,094
don't ruin your career because you wanted to travel, it's not worth.

464
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:07,130
So don't, don't skate around legal logistics,

465
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,942
taxes, all that kind of stuff. So if you're within the same country,

466
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:14,682
like if you're within Canada, it's actually very easy to move to different provinces

467
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:18,226
as long as you're not moving to Quebec. And different states have

468
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:21,282
different tax regulations, so you have to take care of those. So you have to

469
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:25,362
go online, peruse those tax regulations, but over

470
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,914
time you kind of make sense of them. If you're within

471
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,646
a single country, it's usually much easier. But if you

472
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:35,254
want to go to a foreign country, or if you want to go to another

473
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,070
country, like say, if you want to go to Europe and you live in,

474
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,842
say, South America or North America, different countries

475
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,062
have different regulations and you always have to know what those regulations

476
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:48,570
are. So they depend on your nationality, they depend on your passport, they depend

477
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,178
on kind of your work background and everything.

478
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:54,634
So the thing that you have to know is that a lot of countries are

479
00:30:54,672 --> 00:30:58,270
very okay with you traveling there for a month or two or

480
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,118
even for 90 days. A lot of countries are okay with you traveling there,

481
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:04,546
but they're not okay with you working from there. So the

482
00:31:04,568 --> 00:31:07,870
only way to figure this out is to just actually email the embassies.

483
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:12,882
Actually ask the people who are people

484
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:15,586
who work in visa agencies and stuff, and ask them like,

485
00:31:15,608 --> 00:31:18,674
hey, is this legally allowed for me to work from there,

486
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:21,814
even for 30 days? And sometimes for some places in the world,

487
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:25,334
like for the United States, it can be very messy and you

488
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:28,454
might find an answer no, and there's nowhere

489
00:31:28,502 --> 00:31:33,034
around it, so I wouldn't risk anything just

490
00:31:33,072 --> 00:31:36,410
for a few fun trips. So always make sure whatever

491
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,926
you're doing, it's legal. Talk to the visa

492
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,970
people, talk to the state and tax regulations.

493
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,166
Talk to your employer about all the regulations there are and the legalities of

494
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:50,814
your working stuff. And always make sure that you don't skater around these

495
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:54,522
things because they're important. I can't tell you

496
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:58,274
exact specific thing because it depends very much because

497
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:01,726
everyone is under different circumstances, so everyone has different rules.

498
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,454
And that's why I can't talk more about this topic, but hopefully

499
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:08,694
you figure this out on your own. Now,

500
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:12,370
at this point in the story, I was living in Vancouver,

501
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,374
and I've been living there for a while and I

502
00:32:16,412 --> 00:32:19,926
really enjoyed living there. So this is my third province in the

503
00:32:19,948 --> 00:32:23,658
story. And as much as I enjoyed living in the paradise of

504
00:32:23,664 --> 00:32:27,766
Vancouver, I couldn't resist the idea of traveling and exploring

505
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:30,620
more places. So one day,

506
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,850
as I'm going about my day, I searched through Google flights

507
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,534
and I was searching through the all areas feature. So the way

508
00:32:39,572 --> 00:32:43,454
you use this feature is that in the from area you

509
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:46,658
enter the city of residence, the city where you're staying at,

510
00:32:46,744 --> 00:32:50,434
and in the to area you enter the name of your country or

511
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:54,402
the continent that you want to go to, whatever it is, whatever your destination is.

512
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:57,734
So for me, the search feature kind of looked like this.

513
00:32:57,772 --> 00:33:02,230
In the from area I entered Vancouver, in the to area I entered Canada.

514
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,750
So here's Vancouver and here's Canada.

515
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,634
And what it would do is that it would show me all the cheap

516
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:13,066
flights from Vancouver to other places in Canada without me

517
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:16,890
having to manually type in the name of the places over and over again.

518
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,266
And it kind of makes a large map of all the cheap places that

519
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:23,978
I could actually go to. So I use this feature whenever I'm feeling

520
00:33:23,994 --> 00:33:27,274
a bit adventurous and I want to do a nice weekend

521
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:30,494
vacation or something. So as I was doing this,

522
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:34,786
I saw that the flights to Calgary back and forth were

523
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:38,718
just like $100. They were super cheap. So I booked

524
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:42,546
a mini weekend vacation of like a long weekend. So it

525
00:33:42,568 --> 00:33:46,146
was like a four day vacation. And little did I know that

526
00:33:46,168 --> 00:33:49,478
I would enjoy Calgary so much that I actually wanted to

527
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:53,526
spend more time in Calgary. So what

528
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:56,962
I did was I moved to Calgary after this experiment.

529
00:33:57,026 --> 00:34:00,314
I did this mini experiment. I met some amazing people,

530
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:04,170
had some fun time, and then I made a permanent decision to

531
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,342
move to Calgary. But it started off with a cheap,

532
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:12,078
mini weekend vacation experiment kind of a thing.

533
00:34:12,244 --> 00:34:16,714
And I think you can do this, too, is that whenever

534
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:20,494
we think of traveling and moving places, we always

535
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:23,838
think of it as this gigantic, herculean effort of like,

536
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:27,442
hey, you're going to take everything you have and just

537
00:34:27,496 --> 00:34:30,866
move, and you don't have to do all of it. Truth is, you can just

538
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:35,058
take small vacations every now and then and just try out a

539
00:34:35,064 --> 00:34:38,582
different place. Because the thing about trying out different things is that you don't know

540
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:42,118
what you don't know, and you don't even know that you don't know it.

541
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:45,318
So that's my argument for trying out different things,

542
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:49,190
and that's my argument for having cheap experimentation built into

543
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,082
your framework of living life and traveling. So, for example,

544
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:57,114
if you want to try out a new gym membership or any

545
00:34:57,152 --> 00:35:00,938
other kind of fitness application or kind of a cooking application, don't get the

546
00:35:00,944 --> 00:35:04,718
annual membership. Get like a monthly membership. Stay consistent with the

547
00:35:04,724 --> 00:35:08,382
monthly membership. See if it fits your goal. See if it makes you actually

548
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:12,190
better in life. And then, once you're consistent with the monthly membership,

549
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,574
get the annual membership. The idea is that you have to maximize

550
00:35:16,702 --> 00:35:20,354
the low cost experimentation in any different area of

551
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:24,114
life. And then once you have enough good

552
00:35:24,152 --> 00:35:27,794
results from your cheap experimentation, you can

553
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:31,222
extrapolate those results and use it to do a major

554
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:34,546
move, or like a full time annual commitment to anything that you're

555
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:38,182
using. So cheap experimentation is, again, your best friend,

556
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,700
and you should try it out as much as you can.

557
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,850
Now, I want to offer a final note. I've given you

558
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,386
a lot of advice. I've given you a lot of different teeny, tiny tactics here

559
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:52,698
and there, but I wanted to offer, like, a final note, which is

560
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:56,926
kind of a warning note or a cautionary tale. And basically,

561
00:35:57,028 --> 00:36:00,586
it's like, as much as I love traveling, exploring the world, I must warn

562
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:03,986
you that all the tricks are handed to you can sometimes

563
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:07,970
be quite taxing, mentally and physically,

564
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,762
and moving to different cities, adapting yourself to

565
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:15,886
different people, different cultures, all these things can actually be quite taxing

566
00:36:15,918 --> 00:36:19,382
on your mental and physical health. The ability to

567
00:36:19,436 --> 00:36:23,222
recreate everything from scratch. It's actually at a certain point, it becomes too much

568
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:26,886
work, but it's still worth it. For me, it might not

569
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:30,982
be for everyone. Life for me is like a fun challenge,

570
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:34,746
and sometimes the experience or the novelty of new experiences kind

571
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:37,994
of wears out. So I want to

572
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:41,914
show you that the way to take this talk is that it's not just

573
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:45,386
about traveling to different places. It's rather having a new outlook

574
00:36:45,498 --> 00:36:48,926
on life. So you don't have to do everything that I did. You can just

575
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:52,574
take these tiny nuggets, figure out what actually works for you,

576
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:56,126
and try those things out. And when it comes

577
00:36:56,148 --> 00:36:59,266
to traveling, I see traveling, in essence, as the ability to see the

578
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:03,090
world with different eyes. You can do it in a way

579
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,734
which I did, which is like, I literally hopped on places like a nomad

580
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:10,454
and saw different parts of the world. But you can build a new

581
00:37:10,492 --> 00:37:14,198
outlook of life by doing the same thing you do every day,

582
00:37:14,284 --> 00:37:18,274
just with a different outlook. So that's a choice you have to make.

583
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:21,946
And whatever you choose, it doesn't really matter as long as

584
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:25,158
you're enjoying yourself. And there's

585
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:28,586
a philosophy that's very akin to my philosophy in life, and it's called

586
00:37:28,608 --> 00:37:32,142
ikigai. So ikigai is a japanese concept that

587
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:36,350
refers to something that gives a person a sense of

588
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,646
purpose and a meaning for life.

589
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:43,338
So it looks kind of like this. So it's kind of like the intersection of

590
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:46,638
the Venn diagram of the four areas.

591
00:37:46,814 --> 00:37:49,554
So the four areas are what you love,

592
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:53,426
what you're good at, what you can be paid for, and what

593
00:37:53,448 --> 00:37:56,786
the world needs. The idea is to combine all of

594
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,550
them to make something that's truly meaningful and beautiful

595
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:03,366
for you, and that's the kind of life you want to live.

596
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:07,126
For me, I love traveling. I think it combines all

597
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:10,566
the other aspects of life that give me meaning and joy. So I feel

598
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,158
that it's very much in alignment with my values,

599
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,426
and I encourage other people to find that

600
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:19,866
thing for themselves. It may be traveling, it may not be traveling, but whatever it

601
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:23,600
is, find that thing for yourself and try to embody it.

602
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,258
And with that, we arrive

603
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:31,166
at the end of our talk. It was very nice talking to

604
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:35,134
you folks, and I just wanted you to know that if you wanted

605
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:38,346
to recreate a similar journey for yourself, where you want to have remote

606
00:38:38,378 --> 00:38:41,850
work and where you want to be kind of a nomad, explore other places.

607
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,590
One way you could do it is by joining Shopify them.

608
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,602
And so here's the link for Shopify. So just hop onto our careers

609
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:53,286
page and apply for the job that fits you the best. And I

610
00:38:53,308 --> 00:38:55,860
wish you the very best of luck in everything. Thank you.
