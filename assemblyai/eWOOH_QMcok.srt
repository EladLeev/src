1
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,678
Hi, my name is Antoinette and I'm really glad that I have the opportunity

2
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:46,818
to meet you today. I'm happy to be here. I'm excited

3
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:50,634
to speak to you about why IoT devices are mandating

4
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:53,642
a zero tolerated security architecture.

5
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:57,214
And let me tell you why prevention pays. You need

6
00:00:57,252 --> 00:01:01,466
prevention for scalability to increase savings

7
00:01:01,498 --> 00:01:05,010
and massively decrease costs for profitability.

8
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,790
And with that, I mean an increased turnover, increased productivity,

9
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,374
an increased efficiency, basically an improved

10
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:17,206
daily operations. Reliability is the third one.

11
00:01:17,308 --> 00:01:20,902
And with reliability, I mean, how do you make sure that

12
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:24,310
device keeps on working as intended, not only today,

13
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,014
but that it's safe for zero days, for tomorrow

14
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:31,690
as well? All of those three things, scalability,

15
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,542
profitability and reliability, will lift a burner

16
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:39,194
for us. I always start with this slide. When do you think

17
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,134
the first cyber attack took place? Guess what? It's almost 200

18
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:46,590
years ago. Two brothers, Francois and Joseph Long,

19
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,282
manipulated data that went into the national

20
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:55,150
telegraph system. So this clearly demonstrates that criminals

21
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,394
are very creative and always looking for new ways in, and that

22
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:03,454
you need to man it up to make sure that there's no data poisoning,

23
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,074
that the device is really secure. You are

24
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:10,726
as strong, as weak, as lean, and as you can see here,

25
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:15,554
at that time in France, there were all kinds of mechanical telegraph

26
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:19,322
systems like this, so they can sign letters to each other.

27
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:23,514
And it's even said that Napoleon had a tiny telegraph system

28
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:25,610
with him when he took to battle.

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,926
But this one is clearly proven, and this one clearly

30
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:34,190
demonstrates that hackers are opportunistic.

31
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,122
And why do we need zero tolerated IoT

32
00:02:38,186 --> 00:02:42,886
devices require prevention, preventative security controls

33
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:46,110
rather than detective security controls.

34
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,078
Why you need prevention to make sure that the device

35
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:53,394
is not acting as a jump host stepping stone into

36
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,150
your network. We have seen, for example,

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,778
HVAC administrators directly connecting

38
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:03,174
from the Internet into a network. They want to make

39
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:06,754
sure that IoT devices will not be ransomed.

40
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:11,374
We have seen that due to the geographical

41
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:15,430
reasons and situation with Russia and Ukraine,

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,506
some OT devices are ransomed as well.

43
00:03:18,688 --> 00:03:22,190
We have seen lateral movements. Think for example, the mass

44
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,934
terminal hack propagation attacks. And if you are

45
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,406
unfamiliar with propagation attacks, it means basically

46
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:33,726
that an infected device is looking for other devices to infect

47
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,380
and imposing a big risk to a company.

48
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,114
We have seen IoT devices stealing sensitive information.

49
00:03:42,312 --> 00:03:46,166
Think, for example, of the IoT fish tank hack in

50
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:49,846
the US casino. Nobody was assuming that

51
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:53,106
the IoT fish tank that had a smart thermometer,

52
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:56,642
that the thermometer was being used as jump

53
00:03:56,706 --> 00:04:00,666
hose to steal sensitive and extract sensitive information from the

54
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:03,782
network. And we have seen IoT devices

55
00:04:03,926 --> 00:04:07,126
being utilized to start the cyber kill chain.

56
00:04:07,238 --> 00:04:11,098
So the first one is prevention. The second one is making

57
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,794
sure that the IoT device is safe. Mitigation of

58
00:04:14,832 --> 00:04:18,430
physical risk, no misuse or no accident.

59
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,094
The third one is preserving. Remember that I

60
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:25,554
started this talk with making sure the device keeps on working

61
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:29,790
as intended. You need resilient IoT devices.

62
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,934
For example, your ring doorbell has a different security posture

63
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,206
and approach than an MRI or an

64
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:41,494
infusion pump in a healthcare environment. And yet they all,

65
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:45,730
both the ring doorbell and infusion pump hold sensitive

66
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,820
information and require sensitive and security

67
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,650
preventative security controls to keep the sensitive information safe.

68
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,270
Here we have an overview of the threat landscape 2023.

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,958
And let's go over IoT one by one.

70
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:08,730
Here we see the RTU, the remote terminal unit.

71
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,174
Gostec was the first one to claim that they

72
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:15,854
ever in the world had encrypted an OT device,

73
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:19,694
an operational technology device and this telephone.

74
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:23,714
This device is used in energy companies and

75
00:05:23,832 --> 00:05:27,554
it was ransomed and displaying a code f

76
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:32,070
booting. Here we have the Cyborg with the colonial pipeline.

77
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,706
I'm sure you all heard about it. The colonial pipeline

78
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:40,474
was not specifically an attack. IoT was just basically

79
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:44,742
exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in a vulnerable

80
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,246
VPN system and shutting down operation,

81
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:51,898
also causing a massive impact. Here we have

82
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:56,000
the rice cameras. They had backdoors so they could

83
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,554
be utilized to open a referral shell, allowing device

84
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:01,470
takeover,

85
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,786
exploiting authentication and so forth. Here we

86
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:10,526
have cyber warfare as well. Was the danish

87
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:13,982
ot infrastructure that was vulnerable

88
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:17,458
due to siteshell devices that were not patched.

89
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:21,254
Remote code execution could be done. Burf overflows and

90
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,870
account takeover with the sandworm and the candy wiper.

91
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,878
Here on the bottom we have also the sandworm and the candy wiper.

92
00:06:28,994 --> 00:06:32,806
And they caused a massive outage. In Ukraine

93
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,746
there was a blackout. It was immense. In March. Here in

94
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:40,134
June we have the propagation attack and lateral movement

95
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:43,982
of the airsofts proxy botnet. And I think this is so

96
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,294
funny because they were posting a picture of themselves,

97
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:51,306
that they were the Airsofts administrative

98
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:54,414
team. They were selling high quality proxies,

99
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:58,094
meaning compromised IoT devices from doorbells,

100
00:06:58,142 --> 00:07:01,150
garage doors, industrial IoT devices,

101
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,682
and later even mobile phones. And they were exploiting

102
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:10,194
known vulnerabilities and weak credentials. And weak credentials

103
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:14,214
is also really very high risk for

104
00:07:14,252 --> 00:07:17,738
IoT devices because there are lists out there on

105
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:21,750
the Internet. What are the default password for IoT

106
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,654
devices, industrial IoT devices or ot

107
00:07:25,702 --> 00:07:29,530
devices. And hackers. Criminals are using

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,310
those lists to do automated attacks

109
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,446
ot environments, specific countries for

110
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:41,898
example with cyber warfare. So combine the weak

111
00:07:41,914 --> 00:07:45,294
credential list and the default passwords with showdown

112
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:49,458
or Google dorks, and no good can come out of it.

113
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:53,502
So that's something that's really important. Here we have the Whitehead

114
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:57,350
research, the experts for cyber news. It's something really

115
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,142
nice. They took over almost

116
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:05,078
27,000 printers, and they didn't do anything

117
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:08,534
malicious. The only thing they did was forcing

118
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:12,554
the printer to print out a five step guide how to

119
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:16,150
properly secure your printers. Because printers

120
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,054
are often IoT properly secured in small to

121
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:25,502
medium businesses, and they are always used

122
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:29,294
as stepping stone into the network if they are not properly secured as well.

123
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:32,698
So this clearly demonstrates why you need a

124
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:37,106
zero tolerated security architecture. And I really understand

125
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:41,086
the challenges when it comes to securing IoT devices.

126
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,498
They are complex interconnectedness.

127
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:49,218
There's a massive attack surface, and the devices

128
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:52,706
vary from vertical industry, from a smart

129
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:56,774
home to industrial IoT, and they have

130
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:00,042
small hardware resources and how to secure that.

131
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:03,786
So they flourish in hardware capabilities. And there is

132
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:07,462
no standardization whatsoever. There's no devices

133
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:10,854
heterogeneity at all. And what about

134
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:14,654
the data that's on the devices or being processed by

135
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:17,774
those devices? And maybe you didn't know,

136
00:09:17,812 --> 00:09:21,550
but there are three types of data. The first one is data

137
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,974
address. That's data on the device itself. Think,

138
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:28,334
for example, a ring doorbell and a recording. The recording

139
00:09:28,382 --> 00:09:32,270
is on the device itself, and ideally it should be encrypted.

140
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,918
Then we have the data in transit. Think for example, the ring

141
00:09:35,934 --> 00:09:39,974
doorbell again, and it's sending a video over to

142
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,334
a cloud instance. And then we have the third one.

143
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:46,950
That's the data in use. And the data in use is the most

144
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,650
vulnerable data. It's very easy to override.

145
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,870
And criminals can do remote code execution.

146
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:58,566
They can allocate memory because that's the most vulnerable.

147
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:02,602
So you need to man it up. So I understand those IoT

148
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:06,874
device manufacturers because they have to constantly balance

149
00:10:06,922 --> 00:10:10,750
between efficiency, functionality. And that's why

150
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,318
we need resilient security architectures

151
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:18,082
and strategies. That's why I'm advocating for zero

152
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:21,300
tolerated architecture. And guess what?

153
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,718
It doesn't benefit only the security itself. It's also

154
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:29,494
building trust in IoT devices, and it gives you

155
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:32,630
ease of operation with improved profitability.

156
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,310
As stated before, higher turnover, increased efficiency.

157
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,638
Because we detect issues in a very early stage.

158
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:45,354
If you comply and harden the device from

159
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,666
within security, you will detect issues in a

160
00:10:48,688 --> 00:10:52,110
very early stage. The second one is regulations.

161
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,610
You comply with global regulations,

162
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,326
not regulations here in the EU, but also in

163
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,706
the US, because they have key elements and I will

164
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:06,514
address those key elements later on. But you can make

165
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:09,934
sure that if you have incorporated IoT

166
00:11:10,062 --> 00:11:13,954
device security embedded on the device itself, you will

167
00:11:13,992 --> 00:11:17,534
comply with those regulations like the US trustmark

168
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:21,554
for example, in the US and the EU, cyber resilience XcRa

169
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,586
in the EU. And the last one is business continuity

170
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:29,706
with improved reliability, making sure the device keeps on

171
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:33,702
working as intended and that there's no harm done whatsoever.

172
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:38,010
The device is resilient for all kind of attacks.

173
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,266
And here you have a clear distinction what the landscape

174
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:46,282
look like for an IoT device manufacturer. On the factory

175
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:49,802
side we have the development and how to maintain

176
00:11:49,866 --> 00:11:54,206
a huge amount of source repos, build and release management,

177
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:58,686
you name it. It's a huge and daunting task.

178
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:02,626
In the middle we have the device security root of trust,

179
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:06,326
secure key storage, things like that. And on the

180
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:09,654
right hand side we have the market challenges and

181
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:13,074
the market is very competitive. You have the constant

182
00:12:13,122 --> 00:12:16,454
balance between cost and functionalities and how do you

183
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:20,550
scale and how do you make sure that you don't fall victim

184
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,662
to supply chain disruptions? Also a big challenge.

185
00:12:24,806 --> 00:12:28,522
And now we see something new on the horizon. We see

186
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,854
mandatory regulations and you don't want

187
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:35,642
to get a fine reputation damage

188
00:12:35,706 --> 00:12:39,294
whatsoever. And guess what? I told you before we

189
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:42,474
looked into the global regulations and all

190
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:45,826
those regulations have key elements. Here you have an

191
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:49,602
overview of worldwide regulations, but they all

192
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:52,834
address key elements. Things for example like

193
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:56,726
secure access and secure access control. Do you have

194
00:12:56,748 --> 00:13:00,102
the correct permissions? Are you allowed to log in?

195
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:03,590
Then we have the authentication and authorization.

196
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,650
Is there a login protection? Is there a brute force

197
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,026
mechanism in place if they want to brute force, for example,

198
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,866
with the known vulnerabilities and the weak passwords to

199
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:19,610
see if they can get into your device. And we see the data

200
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,182
protection, how do you make sure that sensitive data

201
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,470
is really properly secured?

202
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,790
So let me uncover some astounding facts from last year.

203
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,940
The NIST is assigning all kinds of vulnerabilities to

204
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,286
security flaws like risk impact, likelihood,

205
00:13:38,398 --> 00:13:41,998
you name it. And when I started working as an engineer

206
00:13:42,094 --> 00:13:45,666
25 years ago, we were already in the panic

207
00:13:45,698 --> 00:13:49,302
code. If there was a critical vulnerability of

208
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:52,626
eight or seven, we were in panic mode.

209
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:56,054
We should do something. But the last years we

210
00:13:56,092 --> 00:14:00,278
see a lot of critical vulnerabilities

211
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,626
ranging from nine to ten. And ten is the highest as

212
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:07,110
you can go. And ten means immediate action,

213
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,634
patch, remediate, disconnect, you name it, you should

214
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:14,074
do something to eliminate that potential risk.

215
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:18,126
So that is putting organizations at risk. And if

216
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,160
we do the math and we count it down to a day. You'll see

217
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,050
72 vulnerabilities a day, but eleven critical

218
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,034
that you should address. And how do you make sure that your

219
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,814
device is secured not only today,

220
00:14:34,952 --> 00:14:38,440
but also tomorrow? And that's why you need a

221
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,726
zero tolerant security architecture to make sure that

222
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,386
your device is hardened from within and secure

223
00:14:46,578 --> 00:14:50,570
tomorrow as well. That's why I'm advocating to really

224
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,886
build resilient and trustworthy IoT ecosystem,

225
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,510
not only for end users, but for businesses enterprises.

226
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,274
Because we need those principles of zero tolerance

227
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:07,118
and zero trust. And here you can see it starts from the device itself.

228
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:10,800
You want to make sure that business continuity is

229
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,070
okay. You want to have the trust and user confidence, the regulatory

230
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,786
and legislative acts that you should address. And you want

231
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:23,250
to make sure it's reliable, scalable,

232
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,914
interoperable and profitable, and so forth.

233
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:31,154
That's why I'm advocating for zero tolerated architecture.

234
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:34,520
Saving our toasters and possibly the world.

235
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,770
There's another thing I would like to share with you, the Ericsson Drexler's

236
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,294
Grey goo. And please take a look at his book

237
00:15:42,332 --> 00:15:45,594
if you're curious, and he stated that there

238
00:15:45,632 --> 00:15:49,366
will be IoT assemblers, and an assemblers

239
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:53,374
is being programmed to eliminate all organic matter

240
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:57,246
in the world and to copy itself. So I'm sure

241
00:15:57,348 --> 00:16:01,514
that if we have the zero tolerance security architecture

242
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:04,270
in place, break will not happen.

243
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,806
Combine that with AI and machine learning and the right code of

244
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:10,640
ethics, we will have a great future.

245
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,978
I would like to conclude with a quote of Robert Mueller, the former

246
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:18,360
director of the FBI. There are only two companies,

247
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,294
those that have been hacked and those that will

248
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:25,958
be hacked and checkpoint. The company that I'm working for

249
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:30,120
is adding a third one, those that have been hacked and still don't know.

250
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,166
Thank you so much for attending this session. I'm happy to connect with

251
00:16:34,188 --> 00:16:37,974
you. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. And thank

252
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:38,420
you so much.
