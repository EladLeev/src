1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,714
You. Hello, chaos Engineering.

2
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:33,702
This is Derek Boomer. And today I will present to you five

3
00:00:33,756 --> 00:00:37,106
technology trends and how they can affect you for startups

4
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:40,406
and for companies that are in these Fortune 500. I want to

5
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:43,574
thank, first of all, Mark Polikowski for having me

6
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:46,758
tonight. And I also want to thank the folks in chaos engineering in

7
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:49,686
general. Thank you guys for having me as a speaker. So I'm going to start

8
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:53,802
this presentation again. We're going to cover some hot tech topics

9
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:57,440
out there for technology companies as far as technology themselves.

10
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,046
Again, my name is Derris Boomer. Here's my information to contact me

11
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:05,618
and my website. I will post my presentation on my website

12
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,894
and I'll make sure it's available to you guys also from the conference.

13
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:12,446
So again, tonight's agenda, I'm going to talk about AI,

14
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:16,340
AI, IoT machine learning, software as a service,

15
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,874
and I'll also talk about big data. So here are some trends,

16
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:23,400
these that I wanted to kind of speak about before I go into each detail.

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,826
For AI, we've been seeing this for the last decade becoming

18
00:01:27,858 --> 00:01:31,394
more and more apparent than business on the consumer

19
00:01:31,442 --> 00:01:34,726
side. It's definitely jumped leaps and bounds. Think about what's

20
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:38,330
in your house. You have Google now

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,086
has devices like alexa in your home. You have smart

22
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:45,422
homes now, smart thermostats, and all types of things

23
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:48,974
happening on the consumer side. There are more things happening on the business side

24
00:01:49,012 --> 00:01:52,766
than the consumer side. And we'll get into that in just some detail.

25
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:56,306
For IoT that's been growing, think about how many

26
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:59,666
devices are now enabled within your home, within your

27
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:03,026
business. They're getting IP addresses. So that trend is going to continue

28
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:06,674
here in the near future. Machine learning, we'll talk about that to

29
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:10,198
some degree what that means and how that's going to continue to be a

30
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:13,414
hot topic for people, especially in the career market. I'll talk about

31
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:17,314
SaaS and how that's changed the planet in regards to the Internet

32
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:21,286
and with cloud computing and with the Internet as a whole. The last

33
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,218
thing I'm going to cover is the topic of big data. And we're going to

34
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:27,658
kind of go into why that's really big in a hot

35
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:31,274
job market as well. Now, I have here a graph, and this

36
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:34,670
graph talks about total job openings by skill area

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,734
for the last twelve months. This was a survey done

38
00:02:38,852 --> 00:02:42,234
the end of 2020. It was posted on Forbes magazine,

39
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:46,194
thought it was a pretty interesting graph. First of all, it shows you here

40
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,650
that the software dev that's happening, that's number one

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,026
in software development technologies, no matter what they are whether

42
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,466
it be Apple based, pc based, whatever it is, that's a

43
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:59,766
hot commodity for a skills for jobs. The thing I thought was kind of

44
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:03,618
cool also that I'm going to talk to you guys tonight about cloud technologies,

45
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:07,170
AI, machine learning, and NLP. Those are definitely growing.

46
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,870
Cloud is still number two on this list. Number three is security.

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,122
It. Automation is getting big as well. At the very bottom

48
00:03:14,176 --> 00:03:17,558
here, it did have fintech, parallel computing and quantum computing.

49
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:20,426
So it's a small field, but it's growing. So if you're looking to jump on

50
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,854
something new from scratch, definitely look into quantum computing and

51
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:27,566
parallel computing as well. So the first

52
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:31,326
thing we're going to cover tonight is artificial intelligence. And this is not the

53
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:34,206
movie with the robots. We're not going to get into robots per se,

54
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:37,938
but we'll talk a little bit about what is AI, what is machine learning,

55
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:41,538
what is deep learning? And I want to go into these about the consumer side.

56
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:44,834
Think about as a consumer, how does AI affect your

57
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:48,210
life today, if at all? And it probably does in more ways than you

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,270
think about it. I have a smartphone. I'm an Apple guy.

59
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,486
So if I speak to my assistant, we all know her

60
00:03:54,508 --> 00:03:57,734
name. I won't say it because she'll come on. It can help me with

61
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:01,694
my different applications within my smartphone. And if you're using an Alexa

62
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:04,982
in your house or any other Android based device,

63
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:08,074
you can use those visual assistants. Well, that's an AI, right?

64
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:11,482
If I can tell my AI to create a new calendar event for tomorrow night,

65
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:14,522
it's using voice enablement to do that process. For me,

66
00:04:14,576 --> 00:04:18,314
that's getting to be a hot thing from the voice perspective. But think about AI

67
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:22,014
within your other parts of your life. It's in your car or if it's in

68
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,586
your gaming device, you're seeing AI all over the place.

69
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:29,362
If you're going into, let's say you're going into your different

70
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:33,266
types of television access, if you're using Hulu or

71
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:36,546
if you're using some other company, they're using some AI to figure out what

72
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,614
you like and give you more of the same thing, right? And that's an AI

73
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:42,886
being done behind the scenes to say, hey, Derris likes this kind of a

74
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,686
movie, but he doesn't like these kind of a movie. And that's an AI in

75
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:49,398
that perspective. On the business side of this, think about

76
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:52,870
if you're calling up a company to complain about some consumer thing that

77
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,418
you're having an issue with on a product, and you'll get some kind of a

78
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,634
telephone prompt to click of this number and do that and do this. Well,

79
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:02,346
now you can just sometimes just say it out loud and it'll recognize what

80
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:06,206
you're saying and say, hey, I'm looking for a hardware issue. I'm looking for

81
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:09,754
a software issue. I want to speak to a person that's some natural language,

82
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,766
things happening where they're going to hear your voice and give you a prompt to

83
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:15,886
go to the next part. That's AI in the background. Think about you on a

84
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:19,154
website and certain sites lets you go into a bot to

85
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:22,386
ask questions. Let's say you're going to a dealership's website or you want to ask

86
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,826
about a part you want to purchase. It's going to ask you some questions in

87
00:05:25,848 --> 00:05:29,118
that little bot and point you in the right direction to get that resolved for

88
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:32,678
you. As an example, AI. We'll cover some more of this AI in detail and

89
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:36,070
some other topics here. But the hot jobs here on the far right,

90
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,038
which is data analytics, NLP engineer, UX developer,

91
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:43,802
data scientist, big developer, software engineers. The hot

92
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:47,898
focus areas on the far left here, gamification, for example,

93
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:50,854
and I'm not referring to you creating video games.

94
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,878
I'm talking about gamification and other business sectors.

95
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:57,454
Things such as I want to have some training done for my store,

96
00:05:57,572 --> 00:06:01,182
I'm a retail store company and we want to have gamification to train

97
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:05,278
our people how to sell better or how to process their payroll better.

98
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,818
Whatever the case, they can use the gamification process with AI to make

99
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:11,630
it a better experience for the user. Think about manufacturing,

100
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,642
entertainment, education, training, customer service. Again,

101
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:17,938
these are focus areas that are hot out there for AI. It will continue

102
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:21,554
on these consumer side as well as on the business side in regards

103
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:25,126
to coding languages. If you're a developer, these are some hot things

104
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:28,226
that are happening out there code wise. You need to learn these skill sets

105
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:31,558
to be really good on the hot jobs that I talked about earlier.

106
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:35,686
I'm going to move on to IoT and in regards to Internet

107
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:39,386
of things. As we all know, we have devices that are

108
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:43,246
all receiving ip addresses nowadays and they're getting more and more

109
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:46,446
robust. Think about your home life. You can have your

110
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:50,042
appliances, your refrigerator, your washer, your dryer.

111
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:53,706
They have a Wifi connection. They can call out to the manufacturer

112
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:57,386
and see that they're broken. Or if there's an issue with your dryer, you can

113
00:06:57,428 --> 00:07:00,958
put it up to a telephone and it'll make a certain beeping noise.

114
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,318
In the old world, new world, it can just dial into itself. It can dial

115
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:07,650
out itself on the Wifi and talk to the manufacturer direct.

116
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,046
That's a pretty cool thing for your home line. On the flip side, for the

117
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:14,306
business end of this, I've had clients who are manufacturers

118
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:18,626
of products and they have an assembly line in these manufacturing warehouses.

119
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:22,534
And within that they'll have different devices in that assembly

120
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:26,554
line that has a Wifi enabled connection and they can monitor when

121
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:30,266
there's going to be an issue. They can be proactive to this device. They can

122
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:33,910
have it tell you how far they're going with their productivity.

123
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,466
Right. If I wanted to have, let's say, 19 different manufacturing plants

124
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,294
across the globe, I can now track down to the line item level that,

125
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:45,582
hey, in Singapore, line 14 is

126
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:49,106
down for the next 6 hours, right? And it told me that because it's being

127
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:52,642
monitored through an IoT interface of some type, if I'm over

128
00:07:52,696 --> 00:07:56,114
in Canada, that hey, it's a holiday and we're turning things off

129
00:07:56,152 --> 00:08:00,118
today, perhaps that's the best time to have maintenance for that device. Well, having these

130
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:03,494
devices enabled through the Internet lets these

131
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:07,090
companies be able to manage these things a lot easier

132
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,622
and be more proactive. The hot jobs in these space would be Iot

133
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:14,826
hackers. You can learn to make security better for these companies with their

134
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:18,502
IoT devices. Support technicians. If you're a robot coordinator,

135
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,782
of course, UI UX designers. And if you're an essay

136
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:25,774
solution architect, there are hot jobs in these market. And mind you,

137
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,454
this is the multi billion dollar industry that's going to continue to grow

138
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:33,306
focus areas again, manufacturing consumer goods. Think about wearables.

139
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,818
I have a client where they have these Google glasses that

140
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:40,606
they can utilize on their processes and have that enabled

141
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:44,366
through the Internet. Think about smart buildings, your automobiles,

142
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,686
of course. Think about your teslas and all those good things on

143
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:51,766
the bottom here. Smart cities. That's becoming more and more

144
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:55,686
of a need within the entire country of the US where these

145
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:59,302
cities want to have their devices enabled to make things

146
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,998
better. As an example, if you have street lights or street lamps,

147
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:07,126
traffic lights that are enabled through an IoT perspective, if it's

148
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:10,122
a manhole cover that has a monitor on it,

149
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,498
if it's a meter of some type, these things that can be Iot

150
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,706
connected back to the manhole cover example that each manhole

151
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:21,550
has a sensor that lets us know if it's been opened or not. From security

152
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,118
perspective, if it's a building that has certain

153
00:09:25,284 --> 00:09:29,330
doors or windows connected, you can figure out what's happening. If it's their

154
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,626
HVAc system in that building. From a climate control perspective. You can have

155
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:36,034
an IoT component to that as well. I'm going to move on to machine learning

156
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:40,280
as the next topic here. Now for machine learning, this is about

157
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,790
having an AI that can spot a trend. And then

158
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,718
think about how it's going to tell you to make this a better trend or

159
00:09:47,724 --> 00:09:50,666
in a better experience. And I'll give you an example. Think about if you have

160
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,898
a smartphone on your person

161
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:57,434
and you're driving every day the same route to work. And for the next six

162
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:01,034
weeks, we do the exact same route every single week. And during this

163
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:04,346
route, we stop and get coffee at Starbucks, or we stop every

164
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:07,726
Wednesday to get gas filling at the same gas station. In my example,

165
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:10,782
at some point my smartphone is going to realize, hey,

166
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:14,446
I'm seeing a trend here. That Derrick always stops on Wednesday to

167
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:17,958
get gas. He always stops for coffee at this intersection.

168
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:20,962
At some point, my AI may say in my telephone, hey,

169
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:23,938
you buy Starbucks, you want to go get something? Or it may say, hey,

170
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,182
you didn't get gas today. Well, let's say I'm going to the gym every Saturday

171
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:30,834
at 07:00 in the morning for the last seven weekends. And now this weekend,

172
00:10:30,882 --> 00:10:33,990
it's 08:00 and it goes, hey, you missed the gym. Do you want to go?

173
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,162
That's machine learning. In my example, that it's seeing a trend of how I operate,

174
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:41,638
how I do things, and how I move. The gps isn't involved,

175
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:44,698
and it can tell me a trend and make my life better. Hey,

176
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:47,878
tomorrow's Saturday, Jim. Hey, today's Wednesday.

177
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:51,606
Gasoline tomorrow. Should I change your route to work today? That's the beauty

178
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:54,766
of machine learning in my personal life. On the business side of

179
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,582
this, you have companies who want to figure out,

180
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:00,794
again how to have trend analysis and have these machine

181
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:03,950
learning algorithms make these life better for their employees

182
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,298
and or make a better process in general. Think about things such

183
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:12,158
as these virtual assistant virtual agents. Think about biometrics.

184
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:16,254
Think about learning platforms. Think about speech

185
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,766
recognition. All of these things are a part of this. And the hot jobs in

186
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:23,570
this space would be the following. Machine learning engineers, computer scientists,

187
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,238
AI programmers. There's an array of jobs that

188
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:30,726
are out there in this space, and it's only going to continue to grow year

189
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:33,994
in and year out. I'm going to move on to the topic of SaaS and

190
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:37,820
again, going back to the Internet and cloud based information.

191
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,686
This is the model that we're all seeing, right, where I can now purchase

192
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:45,546
a certain software package. I can pay for it monthly or annually,

193
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:48,846
and it's a much cheaper cost to me as a consumer because now I

194
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:52,446
can access this software, this platform from any device that

195
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:56,074
I have, whether it be a tablet or a smartphone or traditional pc

196
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:59,874
or laptop, I have access to this at all times. The best model of this

197
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:03,326
is to think about Microsoft office on your phone, it's on your tablet,

198
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:06,994
it's on your laptop. You purchased an actual license to use

199
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:10,866
that off of MS office on the cloud, and you can now access MS

200
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:14,134
Word and PowerPoint, all those good things from anywhere you want on

201
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:18,022
your device. On the flip side, for business, we're seeing that

202
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:21,318
same model being utilized over and over again.

203
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:24,842
A good example of that would be salesforce.com. If you're having a sales

204
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:29,018
team with your company on the consumer side, think about the Xbox Live.

205
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:32,358
You can now purchase these games and pay for them monthly.

206
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,630
And that kind of a model for that process for yourself.

207
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,806
Think about smartsheets to track your projects in your company.

208
00:12:39,908 --> 00:12:43,494
So this SaaS model is being utilized all over the place, whether it be AWS.

209
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:47,540
And that trend will continue for certain. The hot jobs in this space,

210
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,470
I will say on the far right here, these lead software developers,

211
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,870
SaaS specialists, software engineers, software support engineers.

212
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,270
It's a big thing happening. It's going to continue. And it's in two focus

213
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,650
areas, right? Whether it's be business to consumer. Again, back to the Xbox ideology

214
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,934
or MS office, business to business. Think about

215
00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:10,666
Salesforce.com and their competitors. Think about companies like

216
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:13,958
Shopify, Zoom, Slack, HubSpot, Atlasian.

217
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:17,338
If you're a Slack user, you can have that stream utilized for your business.

218
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:21,126
If you're some club in your town, you can use slack

219
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:25,194
for that. You know, again, this is platform specific,

220
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:28,286
but there are technologies in the background that will enable this. So if you're a

221
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,358
developer, if you're a person that's going to roll this out, if you're going to

222
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:34,594
support it as an administrator, this space is not going to slow down

223
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:37,870
anytime soon. Our last topic in my speech for tonight

224
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,602
is big data. And I said to you guys earlier that when we're saying

225
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,994
big data, we're referring to like large

226
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:49,022
amounts of data. Think about if you were a company that was collecting data

227
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:53,430
since 1924 and now it's 2021 and

228
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,806
they want to go back and see these history of their company and how

229
00:13:56,828 --> 00:14:00,534
they use this data in that example of historical

230
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:04,646
data in large amounts versus, hey, we're the hottest companies selling

231
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,218
this software product and we have so many customers and we want

232
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:11,482
to track that customer in great detail where they came from.

233
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:15,406
These demographics, how often is being utilized? We're doing an upgrade for the

234
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:19,086
software that can become a lot of data really fast. So in

235
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,366
the big data perspective, you want to have that skill set

236
00:14:22,548 --> 00:14:26,086
to try to go and take this data, have it analyzed,

237
00:14:26,138 --> 00:14:29,442
but more importantly, pull out certain KPIs or

238
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:33,198
certain things that are metrics of information that can be vital to your organization.

239
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:36,946
And I'll give you can example, I had a client where again, they're a manufacturer

240
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:40,610
of goods and their consumer database,

241
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,750
right? That sales information about their consumers, their history,

242
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,414
what they've purchased in the last two decades, that was a battle for their business

243
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:51,194
because they want to get more repeat customers. On the flip side, if they're looking

244
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:54,746
to purchase some demographics data from someone from

245
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:58,954
the outside and figure out how to market to new companies, to new people,

246
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:01,806
that could be a lot of data as well. So my point to you is

247
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:04,878
that big data, it encumbers our lives

248
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:08,814
in so many different ways. Beyond that business side of it, think about

249
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:12,462
yourself as a consumer. You have cable company

250
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:16,494
or you have all of your data with your

251
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:19,698
satellite company. They know who you are, they know what channels that

252
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:23,218
you like to watch. They know what time you watch tv all the time.

253
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:26,478
Well, somewhere in these background that data is being pulled and they're

254
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:29,046
going to look at it in the future to figure out how to serve you

255
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:32,486
better as a consumer. In this example, going back to

256
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:35,254
these slide deck on the client side,

257
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:38,518
that big data, again, if you're a data scientist who's going

258
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:41,698
to out there and manipulate what's happening, what they have in their data sets,

259
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:45,274
if you're a developer in these space, if you're working on the software side

260
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:49,350
of this or if you're a traditional DBA, at any rate, these are hot jobs

261
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,970
and you're going to see this continually happening where big data is going to be

262
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,622
a big part of life, it's not going to stop. So those are the five

263
00:15:56,676 --> 00:16:00,206
hot technologies. As a recap for those who may have come

264
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:04,442
up with a phone call late, we covered these following technologies,

265
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:08,002
which was AI IoT, machine learning,

266
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:11,278
SaaS and big data. So again, if you don't have that skill

267
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:14,738
set already, you can always go and learn that. You can go back to school,

268
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:17,966
you can take courses, you can read books, and that's

269
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:21,250
going to give you a better skill set in the open marketplace.

270
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,982
Lastly, I want to give you guys one more value point before I stop

271
00:16:25,036 --> 00:16:29,062
this presentation. And the value point is to go out there and

272
00:16:29,116 --> 00:16:33,506
work for certain companies. If you don't have that skill set already there

273
00:16:33,548 --> 00:16:37,274
are companies who were consulting companies across the globe that are the big five

274
00:16:37,312 --> 00:16:39,846
or the big six, whatever you want to call them. In this example, I'm showing

275
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:42,938
you guys about Deloitte, PwC, Ernst and Young,

276
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:46,510
KPMG and Accenture. And the beauty about these three companies is that

277
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,966
these companies, they're going to provide for you three things. If you

278
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,926
go work for them, whether you're a w two employee or you're one of their

279
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:56,690
consultants who's a 1099, they're going to give you a check each week.

280
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,126
That's great. But the other two things is if you're

281
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:04,194
a junior level person or intermediate level person, you can go to these

282
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:08,070
companies and work for these and receive on the job training.

283
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,626
And that's vital because now you can actually execute what you've learned in these technologies.

284
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:16,134
Number three, they're going to provide you access to

285
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:20,070
more than one kind of an actual client, meaning you can change business

286
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,478
sectors in different states or cities, and they

287
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:26,474
can expose you to so much. So my value point to you guys.

288
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,098
If you're not an independent consultant already or you don't have your own business or

289
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:32,006
whatever the case may be, you're trying to get into these hot topics of jobs

290
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:35,902
that are out there. Don't be afraid to work with these kinds of companies and

291
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:39,070
get up your skill set a little bit better. So, again,

292
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,320
these are the hot jobs that are out there that they're looking for. In general,

293
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,054
a data scientist, report writers, trainers, project managers, QA analysts,

294
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:50,098
solution architects. These are going to be in hot demand all the time.

295
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:53,886
So if you're looking to align yourself to those five technologies,

296
00:17:53,998 --> 00:17:57,810
these companies are all pushing that day in and day out. Here goes my references

297
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,266
for this presentation as far as what I pulled

298
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:04,066
some data from. Again, I'm Derek Boomer.

299
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:07,494
That's going to conclude tonight's presentation. I thank

300
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:09,926
all of you for your time and your efforts, for listening to me for the

301
00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:13,574
last few minutes. And again, I want to thank Mark so much for

302
00:18:13,612 --> 00:18:17,206
having me on for these conference. Again, guys, thanks so

303
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:20,140
much. Enjoy your time on the conference. Take it easy.
