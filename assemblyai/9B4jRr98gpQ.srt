00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,006
You. Hi everyone. Welcome to Conf 42.

2
00:00:30,108 --> 00:00:34,038
And don't forget the humans. So last year

3
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:36,946
I was in Spain at a technology conference,

4
00:00:37,058 --> 00:00:41,106
enjoying this beautiful beach from friends from the conference.

5
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:43,800
This was an actual story, by the way,

6
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,638
and one of my friends saw the ocean and said,

7
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:50,558
I really want to go out for the swim. It's beautiful. Oh, I want to

8
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:54,110
decompress. Would you mind keeping an eye on me?

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,822
Of course. I said yes. I was going to take a look

10
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:01,566
every five to ten minutes to make sure that I see them.

11
00:01:01,668 --> 00:01:05,474
They were just afraid of getting eaten by a shark. Mostly I

12
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:08,994
take a look, I see them continue with my day. There's a lot

13
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:12,094
going on at the beach. There's beach balls, there's frisbees,

14
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:15,266
there's margaritas, there's popsicles. A lot of

15
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:19,174
fun. Time was being had. Next thing I do is

16
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:23,126
that I look and I no longer see the bobbing head

17
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:27,010
that I was taking care of. Wait, Anna, you literally forgot

18
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,522
an actual human? I did. I forgot a human.

19
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:34,038
I forgot a friend. Well, on that note,

20
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:37,610
why dont we tell you who we are so you don't forget us.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,926
I'm Julie Gunderson, senior developer advocate at AWS.

22
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:46,046
You can find me on socials at Julie Gunderson Gund. And my

23
00:01:46,068 --> 00:01:49,434
name is Ana Margarita Medina. I'm a staff, staff developer

24
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:53,218
advocate, lightstep. You can also find me on all socials on

25
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:57,134
Anna at Medina. Thank you for that, Anna. So let's kick

26
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,726
off with talking about reliability.

27
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:03,134
The AWS well architected framework. It defines

28
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:07,366
reliability, AWS the ability of a workload to perform its intended function

29
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:11,254
correctly and consistently when it's expected to.

30
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:15,190
And look, the increased reliance on technology

31
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,490
in various industries and in everyday life

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,394
and by just regular people and the expectations of

33
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:26,154
people has really increased this push for

34
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:30,206
reliability in our systems, because technology plays a

35
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:33,502
larger role in critical infrastructure and healthcare and

36
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:37,098
finance, transportation and all other areas.

37
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:41,470
And so we have to have a need for reliable systems.

38
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,662
And it's not just this extra need of reliable

39
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:49,570
systems, it's also understanding that these

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,090
dead stars that we see up on here, maybe you've seen them before,

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,494
is that they continue to get more complex. And the

42
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:01,122
interconnectedness and complexity of these systems

43
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:05,014
means that one failure is very likely to

44
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:08,762
actually cause a lot more cascading effects and cause

45
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:12,442
more failures, more downtime, which highlights the need

46
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:16,694
for us to really focus on reliable systems. It is known

47
00:03:16,742 --> 00:03:20,394
that in any complex system that failure

48
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:24,394
is going to happen. But reliability requires

49
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:28,062
us that we make sure that we become aware of these

50
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:31,786
issues, and that we avoid the customer impact,

51
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:35,474
that availability of our infrastructure. And if

52
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:39,454
our systems can actually bring themselves back up automatically,

53
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:42,978
we want to work towards that. And if we're not there,

54
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:46,162
let's start doing the work to make sure that we get there.

55
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:49,986
And to add just a little but more stress to those death

56
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:53,574
balls that you just saw on how complex our systems are,

57
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,314
the reliability of our systems, it's important for a variety

58
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:01,574
of reasons. I mean, you can look at safety. Technical systems

59
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:05,126
are critical for the safety and well being of individuals and communities.

60
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:09,078
I mean, for example, you can look at power grids or transportation systems,

61
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:12,542
medical equipment, airplanes. All of

62
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:16,810
these play a crucial role in ensuring that people are safe and healthy.

63
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,094
And if these systems aren't reliable, the consequences can be

64
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:24,042
severe. This is potential loss of life and injury.

65
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:27,390
Not just julie not being able to watch the witcher on Netflix,

66
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,810
which, by the way, is very good, but we won't get into that right now.

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,538
There's also the economic impact. If we look at how

68
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:37,614
our systems are critical for the functioning of many industries.

69
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:41,010
And mean, you can look, system outages

70
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,930
make major news now, and they cause significant economic loss.

71
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,274
Look at the stock market after a company experiences

72
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,978
a major outage. And then we also have quality of life. And that kind of

73
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:54,634
goes a little bit back to the witcher. But really,

74
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:59,020
technical systems do play a critical role in determining the overall quality

75
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,006
of life. Look back at the last three years

76
00:05:03,108 --> 00:05:06,414
and how our lives were able to really continue on

77
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,834
in a sustainable way due to some of these technical

78
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:13,406
systems. We also have environmental protection and the systems

79
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,962
that rely on these, such as

80
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,490
waste management or water treatment.

81
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,270
The reliability of these systems is crucial to minimizing

82
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,858
impact. And then you also have reputation.

83
00:05:28,034 --> 00:05:32,262
Look, anybody can go to the socials and say

84
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:36,338
all the things, and this happens when we have incidents

85
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:40,006
that impact our sites. So it's a lot of pressure, and I know

86
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,354
that. So let's talk. But ways to kind of reduce some of this

87
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:47,222
pressure. So, first, I want to start just by talking about some of the principles

88
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:50,730
of system reliability. And this is what we look at

89
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,234
from the AWS well architected framework perspective.

90
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:57,966
So, first, we want to automatically recover from failure. And so we do

91
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:01,786
this by monitoring a workload for key performance indicators,

92
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:05,502
or KPIs. And those KPIs, they should be a measurement

93
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:09,774
of business value, not the technical aspects of the operation

94
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:13,134
of the service. And by doing this, you can trigger

95
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:16,374
automation when a threshold is breached, which allows for

96
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:20,450
automatic notification and tracking of failures and automated

97
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,502
recovery processes that work around or repair that

98
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:27,586
failure. And with more sophisticated automation,

99
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:31,114
it's possible to anticipate and remediate failures before

100
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:34,726
they occur. And then you can also test recovery

101
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:37,898
procedures. So testing is often conducted to prove that the

102
00:06:37,904 --> 00:06:41,386
workload works in a particular scenario. In the

103
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:45,134
cloud, you can test how your workload fails, and you can validate your

104
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,734
recovery procedures. You can use automation to

105
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:52,682
simulate different failures, or to recreate scenarios that led to failures

106
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,562
before. And this is something that Anna and I are actually both very

107
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,846
passionate about. We have actually for years worked on teaching

108
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,142
people about chaos engineering, which is actually intentionally

109
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:08,046
injecting failure into your systems to identify weaknesses

110
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:11,926
and remediate them before your customers know this

111
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,094
approach. It exposes failure pathways that you can

112
00:07:15,132 --> 00:07:18,982
test and fix before a real failure scenario occurs,

113
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,614
thus reducing risk. You also want to scale

114
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:26,938
to increase aggregate workload availability. You replace one

115
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:30,734
large resource with multiple small resources to reduce the

116
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:35,066
impact of a single failure on the overall workload.

117
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:39,006
Distribute requests across multiple smaller resources to

118
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:42,702
ensure that they don't share a common point of failure, or one

119
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:46,366
person monitoring that individual in the ocean to make sure that they're

120
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:49,986
still there. Now, a common cause of failure in

121
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:53,902
workloads is resource saturation, and you can monitor

122
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:57,734
demand and workload utilization and automate the addition or

123
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:01,494
removal of resources to maintain the optimal level to

124
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:05,186
satisfy demand without over or under provisioning,

125
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:08,094
and then finally manage change through automation.

126
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:12,070
Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation.

127
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,914
The changes that need to be managed include changes to

128
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:19,382
the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed.

129
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:22,918
Thanks Julie for talking about the principles of reliability.

130
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:26,538
I do really think that the AWS well architected framework

131
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:30,734
gives us a good overview of what we need to aspire for

132
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:33,854
in order to be reliable. I love all of them,

133
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:36,734
and I do think that the capacity one is funny,

134
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,018
especially when we think about if we had more people

135
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:43,426
taking a look at this person that is out swimming in

136
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:46,760
the ocean, maybe we wouldn't have lose them.

137
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,886
But we are talking about humans today,

138
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:55,254
and I want to make sure that we also remember that humans are

139
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:59,274
very complex. There's multiple things that are

140
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:04,006
built into us, and these multiple

141
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:07,706
systems that we have, they each themselves have

142
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:11,102
their own complexities. We can go on and on talking

143
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:14,574
about all of them, but we can narrow it down to your

144
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:17,950
circulatory system, your respiratory system,

145
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,866
your muscular, your digestive, your nervous.

146
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:24,946
There are so many of them that one,

147
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:28,386
they have to be interconnected in order for you

148
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:32,402
to function as a human. But there's other parts that

149
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:36,342
when you start having issues with one, you might start

150
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:40,198
seeing the cascading failure happen in another part of the system.

151
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:44,578
And when something actually goes wrong, you start wondering

152
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:48,502
what part of my human system is actually having these

153
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:51,706
issues. And that's when we go and we look

154
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:55,606
at doctors and ask them, hey, can you help me figure out what's

155
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:59,034
going on? Yeah, thanks for that, Anna. Because the whole point

156
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:02,782
as to why we wanted to give this talk anyway was to

157
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,334
understand that our human systems are very similar to

158
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,886
our technical systems, and we can apply some

159
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:13,390
of the learnings from our technical systems to our human

160
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,802
systems. Werner Volgos, he said,

161
00:10:16,936 --> 00:10:20,798
failures are a given, and everything will eventually

162
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:24,894
fail over time. Now, how we handle those

163
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:28,902
failures can make a huge impact, not only

164
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:32,454
on the meantime to restoration of our services, not only on

165
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:35,110
the bottom line of our organization,

166
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,026
but also on the impact to our humans.

167
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,150
So let's talk a little bit about incident response.

168
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,546
First of all, we talk about an incident. What we mean by that

169
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:49,100
is an incident is an unplanned disruption of service.

170
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,354
So when we look at it, incident response is the organized

171
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,734
approach to handling those incidents. And just to kind of

172
00:10:56,772 --> 00:11:00,174
take a step back and look at how incident response came

173
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,846
around. It's not something that us techies invented. It's actually heavily

174
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:08,690
based on the incident command system, or ics for short.

175
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,242
The incident command system was actually developed after

176
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,990
devastating wildfires in southern California in the 1970s.

177
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,130
What happened is thousands of firefighters responded

178
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,798
to these devastating wildfires, but they found it difficult to

179
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:27,494
work together. They actually knew how to fight fires individually or

180
00:11:27,532 --> 00:11:30,858
fight smaller fires as a small group, but they actually

181
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:34,460
lacked a common framework to work as a larger group.

182
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:38,266
So when we talk about what incident response looks like in

183
00:11:38,288 --> 00:11:42,314
our technical systems, as I mentioned, an incident is an unplanned

184
00:11:42,362 --> 00:11:46,334
disruption of service. But even though it's unplanned, we still

185
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,234
prepare for incidents. And incident response has multiple

186
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:54,058
phases. So there is the preparation. That's the practice piece.

187
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:58,030
That's something that Anna and I would talk about when we talk about chaos engineering,

188
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,870
because it's actually a great way to practice your incident

189
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,106
response. The best teams out

190
00:12:05,128 --> 00:12:08,594
there, they practice. So first week, we've got to detect

191
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:12,326
an incident, right? Our systems generally do this for us. We're hoping that our

192
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:16,070
customers are not telling us via email or twitter.

193
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,866
We have monitoring in place to understand if something is going awry.

194
00:12:21,058 --> 00:12:24,970
Once we've detected that problem, then we want to assess it.

195
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,346
We want to understand what is the severity of this. Is this something that I

196
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:31,946
can wait until the morning to deal with or is this a sev one where

197
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:35,486
we've got to jump on the phone at 230 in the morning and we

198
00:12:35,508 --> 00:12:38,926
alert the right people? So we mobilize folks so

199
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:42,186
that they can all help and respond to this incident,

200
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:45,194
and they work together to resolve the incident.

201
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:49,154
And sometimes during that response process, you've got to call in other folks because

202
00:12:49,272 --> 00:12:51,918
as Anna talked about with those death balls,

203
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:55,330
there's a lot of dependencies, and you might need somebody

204
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,920
from another team. As you respond to the event.

205
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,286
Eventually you resolve the incident, and then

206
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:06,678
you focus on recovery of systems. So let's bring all the systems back up

207
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:10,146
to that nominal state or that steady state, and then it's

208
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:13,574
really important to take a step back and learn from that. And we generally

209
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:17,020
call that a post mortem. And we're going to talk more about that

210
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,990
now. When we talk about incident response in humans, well,

211
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,080
just like incidents, life happens.

212
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,042
There are unexpected unplanned disruptions.

213
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:31,614
I think we've all been through some recently. So whether

214
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:35,502
it's an illness or a family matter burnout

215
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:39,554
or maybe your power went out and you couldn't give a talk at

216
00:13:39,592 --> 00:13:43,378
a conference that you needed to give, we can apply the

217
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:46,626
principles of incident response to these situations. And it just starts

218
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:50,934
with accepting that stuff's going to happen, and we

219
00:13:50,972 --> 00:13:54,194
can apply those principles in personal settings.

220
00:13:54,242 --> 00:13:57,362
So first we prepare, just like we would do with incidents.

221
00:13:57,426 --> 00:14:01,522
We develop a personal incident response plan, and that includes

222
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:05,546
identifying potential incidents that could occur. And you can look back at incidents that have

223
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,954
occurred in your life in the know. Is this something that's likely to occur again?

224
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:12,362
Is it even a natural disaster? Do you know how you're going to

225
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,646
get a hold of all your friends in case of a zombie apocalypse? Where are

226
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,494
you going to meet them? A lot of people are coming to Idaho to meet

227
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:22,154
me, but there could be personal health emergencies or financial

228
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,986
crisis. You want to develop protocols and procedures for responding to

229
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:29,262
these. So once you've done that now, can you detect

230
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,770
an incident? Can you identify a personal incident as early as possible?

231
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,702
And you can do this by monitoring yourself for signals.

232
00:14:36,846 --> 00:14:40,518
And you can look at those different signals which Anna is going to talk about,

233
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:44,402
and then you need to move to the assessment phase. So determine the severity

234
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,422
of that incident and the potential impact on your life. If my power goes

235
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:53,354
out and I can't give a talk at a conference in two big,

236
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:56,822
is that a Sev one? Maybe for those 2 hours, but that incident

237
00:14:56,886 --> 00:15:00,186
will probably be short lived versus maybe a major

238
00:15:00,368 --> 00:15:03,834
health crisis or something that's longer. Once you know

239
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:07,834
the severity, you can mobilize the right people. So, for example, I could call Anna

240
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:11,406
and say, hey, can you help step in and give this talk for me?

241
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:14,734
If it's a talk that she knew and I could

242
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:18,434
mobilize her for other incidents, I might mobilize others. This might be

243
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:22,238
family members, friends, medical professionals, then you respond.

244
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:25,998
So you're going to take the necessary steps to respond to that, which might be

245
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:29,126
stepping away from work, going for a walk, calling the

246
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:32,178
power company, whatever that incident requires,

247
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:36,034
and then we move on to recovery. So restoring normal

248
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:39,606
operations, as we talked about, without moving on

249
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,790
to that recovery phase, that truly recovering from that incident,

250
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:47,066
oftentimes you can fall back into it. So it's important to take that

251
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:51,046
recovery step and to take time to focus on it and make sure you fully

252
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:54,894
recover so that you don't fall back into failure, as we would talk about with

253
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:58,586
chaos engineering, and then take time to reflect. So conduct

254
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:02,286
a post mortem on that incident, take a time to look and

255
00:16:02,308 --> 00:16:05,710
see how did this work? Did the right people get notified?

256
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,942
All of those steps you can apply to personal incident

257
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:13,102
response, because when we look at the goal of incident response,

258
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:16,774
it's to handle the situation in a way that limits damage and

259
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:20,854
reduces recovery time and costs. And this is exactly what we

260
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:24,646
want to apply to our personal lives as well, because when

261
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:28,018
we do this, it can reduce burnout, which, Anna,

262
00:16:28,034 --> 00:16:31,400
I think you're going to talk to us about. Yeah, definitely.

263
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,526
I think you kind of covered a lot in incident response. So folks

264
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:38,682
might be like, whoa, never really consider that it could apply

265
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:42,574
what I do on my job in my personal life. But let's take,

266
00:16:42,612 --> 00:16:46,014
for example, what is a common incident that can happen

267
00:16:46,132 --> 00:16:49,722
to humans, that can happen in tech, that's burnout.

268
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:53,998
Maybe you're still kind of like. Like I hear about.

269
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:58,034
Like I hear that burnout in the technology space is on the rise. But what

270
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:01,810
is burnout? Well, when we ask

271
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,790
a psychologist by the name of Herbert Frudenberger,

272
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,350
who is actually one of the first to be known to be talking

273
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,410
about burnout, they wrote a book in 1980

274
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,962
around burnout. Their definition is that burnout

275
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:20,966
is the state of mental and physical exhaustion caused

276
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,700
by one's professional life. So imagine that

277
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,142
your work just took over your entire life, and your brain

278
00:17:29,206 --> 00:17:32,890
can't work anymore and your body can't work anymore.

279
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,240
That's what they define as burnout in this book.

280
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,334
I personally believe that burnout does not only affect your

281
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:43,730
professional life, unless your professional life is

282
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,698
all the things that you love doing, such as engineering work,

283
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:51,540
diversity work, parenting, and things like it.

284
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,822
But I believe that burnout can also be very complex.

285
00:17:55,966 --> 00:17:59,222
And you can be burnout out by doing multiple things,

286
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:02,710
such as doing a lot at work, having a social

287
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,246
life, your personal life, keeping all those things, and at

288
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:09,270
the same time, when you don't have certain aspects.

289
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,506
So when you don't have a social life but

290
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:16,506
parenting and work takes up your entire time, you can still end

291
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,890
up in a spot of burnout.

292
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,706
I also like saying that I am not a professional,

293
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:27,294
but I have burnt out of my job a few times, so I can speak

294
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:30,970
with that expertise. Burnout is not depression,

295
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,690
but it can definitely lead you there. So in my life,

296
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,526
I use burnout as a signal of things getting rough,

297
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:41,810
of I should really start talking to professionals.

298
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,654
And I looked at a study around burnout by

299
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:49,878
this company called Yerbo. They do surveys around how

300
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:53,574
employees are doing in different spaces. And two

301
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:57,362
in five tech workers are showing a high risk of burnout

302
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:01,450
due to a lot of stress, being exhausted due to their hours,

303
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,582
or just the lack of work life balance.

304
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,154
When we think of the world of DevOps, incident response site

305
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:12,170
reliability engineers, they have to be on the computer

306
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,026
or getting paged at random times a lot more that I'm

307
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:19,546
sure if we were to just look at a DevOps study of burnout,

308
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,480
those numbers actually might be way higher.

309
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,002
And burnout is really hard to deal with.

310
00:19:26,136 --> 00:19:29,006
It's hard to identify that you're feeling burnt,

311
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,462
but it's hard to bounce back from burnout.

312
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:36,194
And some folks actually might leave technology, might leave

313
00:19:36,232 --> 00:19:39,346
their jobs. I know a lot of folks that got burnt,

314
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,800
but, and are still burnt out.

315
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,294
So you might be wondering, Anna, what the hell does

316
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:49,974
burnout actually look like? Well, it looks very different to

317
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:53,222
a lot of folks. It could be exhaustion where you're tired

318
00:19:53,286 --> 00:19:56,278
all the time. It could be that you're lacking motivation,

319
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:59,514
lacking concentration, and it's hard for you to go

320
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:03,214
out and see friends, see your family members, do your

321
00:20:03,252 --> 00:20:07,006
work, which can lead to maybe you not wanting to

322
00:20:07,028 --> 00:20:10,666
be around people that you know, people that care about you, and you alienate

323
00:20:10,698 --> 00:20:15,198
yourself, which then might mean that you start getting frustrated.

324
00:20:15,374 --> 00:20:19,294
For a lot of people, myself included. Some of these symptoms,

325
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:22,946
like some of these burnout thoughts, become physical symptoms and your

326
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:26,718
body starts feeling them. You can also take the approach where

327
00:20:26,744 --> 00:20:31,030
your self esteem actually drops to zero or just gets really low,

328
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,722
and that could trigger a really bad depressive episode,

329
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,326
or it can also lead you down the route of substance

330
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:39,210
abuse.

331
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,794
So how is it that we can be more careful how

332
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:48,102
can we be more in tune with our systems to prevent

333
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,834
these incidents from happening? Well, that is where the practice

334
00:20:51,882 --> 00:20:55,486
of observability comes in play. Observability in

335
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:59,354
our technical systems is the practice of understanding

336
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:03,162
our systems. This leverages telemetry

337
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:06,706
data techniques, and it allows for us to

338
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:10,558
set up new practices based on the insights that we've uncovered.

339
00:21:10,654 --> 00:21:14,174
That telemetry data can be traces, can be logs,

340
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:18,226
can be metrics, it can be events. Just information that lets

341
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:21,560
us be aware of how a technology system is doing.

342
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,722
So how does observability look like in humans?

343
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:30,490
Well, after a human is deployed to production

344
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,090
out of the box, they actually have observability.

345
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,666
Our bodies have senses to observe the world around us.

346
00:21:38,848 --> 00:21:42,414
Certain part of our systems have specific practices that

347
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:46,094
help us with us being able to define what

348
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:50,254
we feel and how we should act, such as our flight or fight

349
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:54,114
or flight response. But sometimes

350
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:58,402
these things are biased due to our perception or

351
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:01,246
bias due to the lack of personal insight.

352
00:22:01,358 --> 00:22:05,442
So that can mean that you might actually have

353
00:22:05,496 --> 00:22:08,866
an okay day, but you are still going through a panic

354
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:12,386
attack. That perception makes you feel like you're

355
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:15,654
in crisis, but in reality, you're not really in

356
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:19,366
danger. So the question becomes,

357
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:22,934
what are the traces, the logs, the metrics

358
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:26,378
that humans have around us, or that we can create,

359
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:29,606
that we can draw these correlations from the events

360
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:31,200
that we have in real time?

361
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,374
We have to work on these insights, and everyone's going

362
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:40,654
to work on them differently, because those signals and

363
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,902
insights are going to be different for what matters to you,

364
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:47,250
what you want to work on, what complex system

365
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,658
in your human system matters to you the most.

366
00:22:50,824 --> 00:22:54,290
It could be making sure that you have habits set up,

367
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,598
making sure that you have your heart rate monitor always on,

368
00:22:58,684 --> 00:23:02,002
or that you have a certain heart rate throughout the workday,

369
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:05,062
that you're exercising every single day,

370
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:08,654
and that you're doing 10 miles of exercise

371
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:12,198
on the weekends. It could also mean monitoring

372
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:15,846
your mood intensity, or making sure you're taking your medication, your blood

373
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:19,226
levels. We are at a point that we

374
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:22,878
can actually continue to increase our insights on our human

375
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:26,414
system. We have technologies such as

376
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:30,014
wearables, that allow for us to understand what's going on,

377
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:33,566
such as the apple Watch, fitbits, the oral rings.

378
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:37,214
They track our heart rate, our sleeping patterns.

379
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:40,206
They can also track things like glucose.

380
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:43,774
And there's a whole bunch of other biology

381
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:47,400
field with hardware that is fun to geek out in.

382
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,822
But as you can tell, we are

383
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:53,720
responding to things going wrong.

384
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,842
There is nothing that is that preventative about this.

385
00:23:57,996 --> 00:24:01,702
So my other question becomes, how can we enable

386
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:05,462
logging for our humans system via food tracking,

387
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:09,190
mood tracking, habit or connection tracking?

388
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,894
Because we want to add as many signals and notes to

389
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:16,430
our day to day to actually understand how every single

390
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,522
change applies to your life. Like did eating a donut

391
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:24,578
at 11:00 p.m. Make me extremely cranky this morning.

392
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:28,034
Should I have not done that? Maybe. I wish I could

393
00:24:28,072 --> 00:24:31,602
know. I mean, maybe or maybe not.

394
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:33,540
Maybe it made you happy this morning.

395
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,662
That is a very poor point. So we

396
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:42,134
are creating these insights, but where do we go from

397
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:45,606
there? What do we do? Well, when it comes

398
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,822
to our technical systems, we have capacity

399
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:52,662
planning. Capacity planning is the practice

400
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:56,074
of planning to set up your technical systems to be

401
00:24:56,112 --> 00:24:59,274
successful in the future. You want to make sure that

402
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:02,942
you have enough infrastructure provision. You want to make sure

403
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:06,202
that your AWS account has all the limits raised

404
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:10,190
for your high traffic event. You also want to make sure

405
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,454
that you have an on call rotation for the

406
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:16,466
services that are going to be used a lot.

407
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:20,274
Or you want to make sure that you've trained the folks on

408
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:24,318
call to actually take the right actions when an incident

409
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:27,954
does occur. And that's where you do things like chaos engineering

410
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:31,734
and load testing. And hopefully you're doing them together because

411
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:34,760
that is what sets you up for success.

412
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:39,306
Agreed. When it comes to

413
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:42,134
humans, you got to do capacity planning,

414
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:45,478
too. Humans have a maximum capacity.

415
00:25:45,654 --> 00:25:48,454
This can be in the form of physical,

416
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:51,218
emotional, financial awareness.

417
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:54,414
Educational. People have to be in tune with their

418
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:58,014
limit. How can you do that? Well, you ask

419
00:25:58,052 --> 00:26:01,134
yourself some questions. What do you value?

420
00:26:01,332 --> 00:26:05,034
Do you even know what your values are? Maybe think about doing

421
00:26:05,092 --> 00:26:09,234
some values exercises to make sure that your day to day actions are

422
00:26:09,272 --> 00:26:12,418
aligned with the version of you that you want

423
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:15,858
to be. You also might want to ask yourselves,

424
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:19,558
how many spoons do I have? How much bandwidth do I have?

425
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:23,334
How much energy do I have to either handle a

426
00:26:23,372 --> 00:26:27,446
coworker currently giving me all this pr

427
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:30,810
feedback in all caps that I'm not really happy with,

428
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,700
or my toddler throwing their gerber in my face.

429
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,258
How much am I able to handle? You want to be in tune with yourself.

430
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:42,798
And with that comes that question, like, check in with yourself.

431
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:46,634
Have I prioritized myself? Because you can't

432
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:50,234
be there for others. You can't be there in situations if you haven't

433
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:54,382
taken care of your own needs. Kind of like what they tell us in planes.

434
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:57,954
Make sure to put on your oxygen mask first before you go

435
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:01,186
and you help someone. So how

436
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:05,166
do you apply it? Well, maybe remember that you're

437
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:08,742
not a computer. You are a human. Maybe that

438
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:12,054
means that you have to turn off the news, you have to turn

439
00:27:12,092 --> 00:27:15,846
off technology, you have to request time off and go on

440
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,920
vacation, you have to see your loved ones.

441
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,446
Or maybe you have to make sure that you have a big group of subject

442
00:27:23,478 --> 00:27:27,866
matter experts in your life and that you're spending time with know

443
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:31,414
other things that you can really do is focus on a blameless

444
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:35,674
culture. So when we talk about focusing on a blameless culture

445
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:39,662
with everything that Anna just told us, know, I want to thank her

446
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:43,186
for that time that you took and point out that when we talk

447
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:47,026
about Anna losing somebody in the ocean, we're not necessarily blaming her

448
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:50,034
for that, although it sounds like it. Sorry,

449
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:53,346
Anna. In complex systems of

450
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:56,774
software development, there are a variety of conditions that

451
00:27:56,812 --> 00:28:00,006
interact that lead to failure, right? So as Anna was talking about the

452
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:03,094
ocean, there were frisbees, Ana Margarita, Medina,

453
00:28:03,132 --> 00:28:06,770
sunscreen, and people, a variety of conditions.

454
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,210
So we want to perform a post mortem at the end of an incident.

455
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,622
Some folks may call that a retrospective, an RCA,

456
00:28:15,686 --> 00:28:19,018
whatever it is that your team calls it. The goal is to understand

457
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:22,826
what were those systematic factors that led to the incident

458
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:27,082
and identify actions that can prevent this kind of failure from reoccurring

459
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:30,986
in the future. The thing with a blameless post mortem is it stays

460
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:35,074
focused on how a mistake was made instead of who made

461
00:28:35,112 --> 00:28:38,674
the mistake, how it was made instead of why it

462
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:42,546
was made. This is a crucial mindset, and it's really important to understand.

463
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:46,702
We want to leverage that mindset. A lot of leading organizations

464
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,066
do. We have the benefit of hindsight when we're

465
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:53,414
in a post mortem? We want to be careful not to have

466
00:28:53,452 --> 00:28:57,458
that turn into a bias. We want to ask how questions

467
00:28:57,564 --> 00:29:01,014
and what questions instead of why. Questions? Why, Anna,

468
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:04,602
did you lose track of that? Why instead

469
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:08,074
of how, Anna, what was

470
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:11,866
going on at the time? What led you to make those decisions? Boy, I really

471
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:15,326
feel bad for picking on you in this, Anna, just for everybody to know.

472
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:17,520
Anna and I have known each other for years.

473
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,382
It's called a single point of failure. That's what went wrong

474
00:29:22,436 --> 00:29:25,998
to begin with and actually probably shouldn't have been a

475
00:29:26,004 --> 00:29:29,154
single point of failure. There should have been other people that were asked to keep

476
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:32,654
an eye on this person. But let's talk about a blameless culture

477
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:36,226
in humans. Look, humans are humans.

478
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:39,650
They are going to fail. We will fail. It is unavoidable.

479
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:43,720
So practice blameless to yourself.

480
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,830
When we talk about that blameless culture and not having

481
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,786
that hindsight bias when we look at a

482
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:55,066
post mortem that also happens in our lives. I can

483
00:29:55,088 --> 00:29:58,330
tell you I've been guilty for laying in bed and

484
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,086
going over my day with, why did you do that? Why did you do that?

485
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:04,334
Why did you do that? Be kind to yourself.

486
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:08,190
Practice blamelessness. Use how and

487
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:12,154
what questions. Give yourself a break and realize that you're

488
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:15,426
not alone as well. Other people

489
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:19,154
feel stress and struggles. Folks just might not talk

490
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,066
about it. And it's okay to give yourself a break.

491
00:30:22,248 --> 00:30:25,574
It's very rare that one of our actions is going to

492
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:28,934
cause the next zombie apocalypse. So remember that

493
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:31,430
and try to keep things in context.

494
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,926
And this is really important because we want to move in

495
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:39,514
our sociotechnical systems from that reactive approach where we're just all

496
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:43,734
scrambling because the phone rang, to a more proactive approach

497
00:30:43,862 --> 00:30:47,366
where we are calm, we understand our systems,

498
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,162
and ideally we're preventing

499
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:54,750
situations from occurring. We look at that

500
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,750
with disaster, unexpected problems that result in

501
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,630
slowdowns and interruptions or network outages.

502
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,270
We can prepare for these by practicing,

503
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,706
by working with our teams, getting to understand our

504
00:31:10,728 --> 00:31:14,114
systems better and preparing. And then we can move

505
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:17,574
that to the humans. Anna, talk to us about that. I love

506
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:20,694
talking about humans because we do have to

507
00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:23,986
move from always being reactive and heading

508
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:27,910
into the emergency room because something went wrong or having

509
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,458
a meltdown and having to call a friend because things are not

510
00:31:31,484 --> 00:31:34,762
working out. Fair point. There's nothing wrong with calling your friends

511
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:37,850
when you're having a meltdown. Number one, that's what you should be doing.

512
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,482
They're your friends to begin with. But what are some things

513
00:31:41,536 --> 00:31:45,358
that we could be doing today that allow for us to live

514
00:31:45,444 --> 00:31:48,830
a life worth living? Live a life with your loved one.

515
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,638
Live a life that you're happy with. And that

516
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:56,290
brings me to staying connected to people around you.

517
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,826
Human connection is so crucial. I'm sure all

518
00:31:59,848 --> 00:32:03,554
of us in this pandemic world that we're still in feel

519
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:07,714
it. It's not the same to be with your loved ones on virtual

520
00:32:07,762 --> 00:32:11,286
settings like this versus actually spending in person time with

521
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:14,854
you. And it also weekends on your human love language. Are you

522
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:18,006
someone that is happier when you're actually

523
00:32:18,108 --> 00:32:21,706
spending physical time with someone in the same room?

524
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:25,766
Or do you need something like acts of service that someone helps

525
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,306
you do activities with you? We all want to feel

526
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:32,806
connected and the same way

527
00:32:32,848 --> 00:32:36,366
that we want to continue moving from reactive to

528
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,454
proactive. Another way to do it is to set up

529
00:32:39,492 --> 00:32:43,166
some goals, set up some north stars of where you want your life to

530
00:32:43,188 --> 00:32:46,674
be. We're at the beginning of the year is the perfect time to

531
00:32:46,712 --> 00:32:50,066
think about New Year's resolutions or think about where

532
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:53,346
you want to be at the beginning of next year. What is

533
00:32:53,368 --> 00:32:56,646
it that you're doing today that allows for you to know that

534
00:32:56,668 --> 00:33:00,134
you're working towards them? And the same way that

535
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:03,478
in incidents we are preparing people around us,

536
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,934
AWS subject matter experts, we could use the

537
00:33:06,972 --> 00:33:10,698
same concept of subject matter experts in our personal life

538
00:33:10,784 --> 00:33:14,022
and set up a board of directors, which includes

539
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:17,738
things like your past managers, your peers, leaders that

540
00:33:17,744 --> 00:33:21,520
you look up to, just folks that you can ask,

541
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:25,054
hey, is this the right move for my career? How do

542
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:28,430
I deal with the coworker that's doing WXE?

543
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:34,354
And lastly, another way that we can continue

544
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:38,100
to be proactive is to plan for the future.

545
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,194
In psychology. In therapy, there's a specific type

546
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:46,342
of therapy called future directed therapy that is really cool.

547
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:49,846
It's all focused on making humans think about the

548
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:53,542
future and be content with the future. And it does

549
00:33:53,596 --> 00:33:57,094
it by doing prospection, the action of

550
00:33:57,132 --> 00:34:00,554
looking forward into the future. And that

551
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:03,914
is where you but that North Star and

552
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:07,626
you work towards it. That's where you put that reliability goal and

553
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:09,180
you work towards it.

554
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,198
And of course, I can't do a talk about

555
00:34:15,284 --> 00:34:18,894
tech in humans and not

556
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:22,582
throw some yaml at you all. Don't forget to Kubectl

557
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,630
apply humans yaml.

558
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,106
And don't forget to set some resource limits and make sure that you

559
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:30,850
have everything set up properly.

560
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,194
So some self care tips to leave you all with.

561
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:40,134
Make sure to check in with yourself often, whatever often means

562
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:43,654
for you, whether it's weekly or monthly. I recommend

563
00:34:43,772 --> 00:34:47,414
at least quarterly to take out the burnout survey that you can find

564
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:51,542
on Burnoutindex Yarbo Co. Check in on your teammates

565
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:55,514
and loved ones just to make sure that they're also hanging in there.

566
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:58,922
I love treating myself, but you should also do something

567
00:34:58,976 --> 00:35:02,698
nice for yourself every once in a while. That might be getting a massage,

568
00:35:02,794 --> 00:35:06,478
getting your nails done, booking a vacation with your loved ones, eating a

569
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:09,840
lot of ice cream, playing video games, you name it.

570
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,534
Make sure to unplug, turn off social media,

571
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:17,460
turn off the Internet, turn off the news, turn off technology,

572
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,246
be with yourself. What are you like when you don't

573
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:24,430
have all this stimulation that we have with electronics?

574
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:28,182
And as you work towards all this, be kind to yourself,

575
00:35:28,316 --> 00:35:31,686
but set some deadlines and start small as you work

576
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:35,718
through these things. Remember, you can be flexible with yourself,

577
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:40,086
but you can work towards having a reliable humans systems too.

578
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:43,878
And we want to make sure that you have some resources.

579
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:47,402
So I'm going to pause here to let folks take a screenshot or

580
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:50,414
check out some of these resources that we have for you.

581
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:54,158
Don't forget, there's apps, there's open sourcing, mental health,

582
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:57,550
there's lifelines that might pertain to you

583
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,310
and your friends and family members. Ultimately,

584
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:06,446
it's okay to ask for help. And we're

585
00:36:06,478 --> 00:36:09,794
all humans. Be kind. Now that

586
00:36:09,832 --> 00:36:13,666
we've stated that we're all humans and that you should be kind, quick point to

587
00:36:13,688 --> 00:36:17,154
note is that all images in this presentation were created by humans.

588
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:20,774
So thank you, Dolly. Any image that had this little

589
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:24,200
graphic on it was created by Dolly. And then

590
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,166
to kind of finish up Anna's story, I was the person that

591
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:31,562
she lost in the ocean. There were a couple

592
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:35,366
of things that led to this. I had shared

593
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:37,990
my location with Anna, but my phone was with Anna,

594
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,866
not with me in the ocean. I did end up about a quarter

595
00:36:41,898 --> 00:36:45,054
of a mile away, and it was a fun walk back.

596
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:48,474
Ultimately, I'm alive, did not get eaten by a shark,

597
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:51,182
and still very much so.

598
00:36:51,236 --> 00:36:55,070
Appreciate my friend for making sure that I'm alive.

599
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,182
She's never going to let me live it down that I forgot her

600
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:02,366
at the ocean. Where is that? I mean,

601
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:06,342
there is, but we've learned. We have learned from this. And other people

602
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:10,246
will monitor me when I'm in the ocean, or maybe I'll pay attention to

603
00:37:10,268 --> 00:37:13,720
myself. Aws. Well, so thank you for joining us.

604
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,614
All right. We're great.
