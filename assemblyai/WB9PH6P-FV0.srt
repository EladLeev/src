1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,126
Jamaica make up real

2
00:00:06,148 --> 00:00:09,902
time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems and

3
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:13,614
observing changes exceptions errors in real

4
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:17,914
time allows you to not only experiment with confidence but respond

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:20,480
instantly to get things working again.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:01:04,798
Those hi,

7
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:08,306
my name is Fabrizio and I'm going to talk today about

8
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:12,286
how can we learn to overcome the choice paradox.

9
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,134
Let me just begin introducing myself. I've been in love

10
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:18,360
with code since 2002.

11
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,190
This led me to can entrepreneur career.

12
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,640
In 2005 I started my first company. It was a software company,

13
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,810
ended up entering in these academia.

14
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,754
I have my life as a researcher since 2008

15
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:39,782
needed up getting my phd and since 2011

16
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:42,590
I've been working with startups,

17
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,160
both mine and some consultancy work.

18
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,894
Right now I'm the CTO at Bxblue and I

19
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:54,114
will share a bit of my experience avoiding and

20
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:58,194
how to handle decisions in this environment that we live in.

21
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:02,210
So why does this matter for us developers?

22
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,670
So when we think about problem solving,

23
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,922
we think about an analytical process that is used to identify

24
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:13,654
the possible solutions to the situations that are in our

25
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:17,270
hands. And part of the problem solving

26
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,714
process is making decisions. So that's why I'm

27
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:25,718
talking about the choice products today and problem solving

28
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:29,546
and decision making. They are very intertwined and

29
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:33,294
I'll show you here with an example. So imagine that you have

30
00:02:33,332 --> 00:02:37,310
to handle some payments and you

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,570
right away is presented with a choice.

32
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,574
You can choose to implement the solution

33
00:02:44,702 --> 00:02:49,394
of handling payments directly with your

34
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:52,526
choices. So you can integrate directly with visa,

35
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:57,382
with the banks, with many other credit card companies,

36
00:02:57,516 --> 00:03:01,270
or you can use some kind of gateway like stripe or PayPal.

37
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,606
There are some advantages, there's some disadvantages with each

38
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:08,938
of these choices. So let's say

39
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:12,022
after you waiting everything up, you decide,

40
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:16,006
okay, I'll go with PayPal. So right now you have another choice,

41
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:20,058
how you scale this gateway, your payment

42
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:24,526
options, there are so many different solutions and

43
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:28,286
you decide, okay, I would use some kind of messaging system and

44
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:32,314
you have other options for messaging system. You can use rapid Miq redis,

45
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:35,826
you can use AWS sqs, you can use

46
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,806
Kafka, that's so used right now. And you decide,

47
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:43,394
okay, after waiting all these options, you say

48
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:47,138
okay, I'll go with Kafka, and okay, so then you

49
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:50,534
go to the team and say we're going to implement with

50
00:03:50,572 --> 00:03:54,274
PayPal, we're going to use Kafka. So what language

51
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:57,640
should you use? Should we use Ruby, that is the main

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,090
code that we're using today. Or should we use

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,270
Java because we think it's more stable?

54
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,530
Or should we try something new like closure or python that

55
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,720
some of the members of the team want to try it out.

56
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,798
After every new decision, you're presented with more options.

57
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:22,710
And that's how we solve problems with code nowadays.

58
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,146
You are always making choices and you

59
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:29,938
are always making decisions. And how can you

60
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,890
avoiding CTO end up in these paradox of choice?

61
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,054
So most of what on my talk today will be based in this

62
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:41,778
book, the Paradox of Choice by Barish Watts.

63
00:04:41,954 --> 00:04:46,402
It's a controversial book, so I'll try to stay focused

64
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:50,186
on the main points of the book. So the

65
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:55,638
book starts talking that we try to correlate

66
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:59,114
autonomy and freedom of choice with our

67
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:02,702
own well being. And we think that choice is

68
00:05:02,756 --> 00:05:06,250
also a critical component of autonomy and freedom.

69
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,278
So we need autonomy and freedom to feel well,

70
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:13,170
but we also need to have

71
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,526
the ability to choice to feel that we have this freedom

72
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:20,786
and autonomy. But experience

73
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:25,634
shows that having more choice doesn't

74
00:05:25,682 --> 00:05:29,266
give us more freedom and autonomy. And we don't seem

75
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:32,742
to be benefiting from this increase of

76
00:05:32,796 --> 00:05:36,866
choice psychology in our minds.

77
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,834
So how can we see this?

78
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:43,834
So the first way that we can experience

79
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:47,674
things effect is with the so called

80
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:51,134
buyer's remorse. So it's that sense of regret that we

81
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,630
have after making a purchase,

82
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,446
especially when it's something very important. And usually

83
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:03,230
the choice paradox happens because we are trying to avoiding the buyer's remorse

84
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,882
when we're trying to make a choice. We don't want to feel

85
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:10,370
that after making that choice, we are going to feel bad

86
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,860
afterwards. So things is one of the main

87
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,938
hardships that we have when we are making choices. So let's

88
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:23,334
see can example. So imagine you're looking CTO

89
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:27,542
paint your house, and you have infinite amount

90
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:30,842
of colors at your disposal. And you can think

91
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:34,346
like if you make a simple choice, like, I'm going

92
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:37,706
to paint my house gray, but there

93
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:41,370
are so many different choices of gray. You have

94
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,219
yellowish gray, you have saint gray, and you have many,

95
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:49,182
many other options. And you can freeze when you're trying to choose

96
00:06:49,236 --> 00:06:52,798
this kind of what kind of paint you want.

97
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:56,466
CTO paint your those. And you can try to

98
00:06:56,488 --> 00:07:00,178
avoid this kind of situation if you just have

99
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:03,874
a simple palette to choose from. And this is what most

100
00:07:03,912 --> 00:07:07,846
people think when they are trying to choose. So when you're trying to

101
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:11,558
paint your house, you start with a small palette or the

102
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:16,006
color choices that somebody

103
00:07:16,108 --> 00:07:19,846
or your architect gives to you. They try to limit

104
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:23,370
your kind of options so you can choose better and you spend

105
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,620
less time choosing how to paint your house.

106
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,446
And this amount of options can lead you to what

107
00:07:30,468 --> 00:07:34,174
is called analysis paralysis. Is when the fear of

108
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:37,818
making an error outweighs the realistic expectation

109
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:41,034
in making that decision fastly

110
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,850
is the famous adash,

111
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,506
perfect is the enemy of good. So you're trying to be perfect in

112
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:50,930
your decision, and you end up making no decision at all.

113
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,990
And what the book says CTo us, is that after

114
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,062
these two components, we learned that

115
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:02,854
having more choice does not equate CTO having more

116
00:08:02,892 --> 00:08:05,734
happiness. Why that?

117
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:10,394
Because we think that freedom is

118
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:12,810
the opposite of commitment.

119
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,882
Because when we have the freedom of choice, we can choose

120
00:08:17,936 --> 00:08:21,850
anything. But after we choose, we have to commit with that choice,

121
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,470
so we lose that freedom. That's why we fear so much.

122
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,018
And we usually things that having less rules

123
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:32,000
means a lack of choice. But that's not true,

124
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,538
because when you have no rules, sometimes you cannot choose,

125
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:39,380
because there are so many options that you don't know where to start.

126
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,218
And sometimes having rules, like less options,

127
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:45,490
can help you make that choice.

128
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,006
For example, when Twitter started, they have only 104

129
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:54,278
characters, and it was just after

130
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:58,346
the rise of the blogs. And you have so many creativity in

131
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:02,074
Twitter because that restriction of 140

132
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:05,738
characters helped people to make

133
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:09,274
more choices and CTO create more. And we see this

134
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:12,782
every day with new platforms and other kind of rules that we create

135
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:16,702
for ourselves and help us choose more.

136
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:20,254
And lastly, the fear of missing out.

137
00:09:20,372 --> 00:09:22,270
So when we make a choice,

138
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,974
we fear what we don't know, like which other choices

139
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:30,594
that I should be considering, and I did not.

140
00:09:30,792 --> 00:09:35,074
So that's the last part. So let's look now how

141
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:38,786
our brain handles choices, because it's

142
00:09:38,818 --> 00:09:41,906
very important for us to understand what mechanisms

143
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,350
are inside our head when we're trying to make these choices.

144
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,640
I want to start saying that I'm not an expert in

145
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,030
neuropsychology,

146
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:00,254
although talk about some parts of the brain. It's worth

147
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:03,646
knowing that our brain is very plastic, so it can

148
00:10:03,748 --> 00:10:07,182
adapt to its

149
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:10,666
shape. Not shape, the use of its shape according

150
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:14,574
to its use. But I'll focus here on two main components.

151
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:17,970
So the first component is our prefrontal contexts.

152
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,730
It's the part of our brain responsible for reasoning.

153
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,894
It's usually a part of our brain that consumes a

154
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:29,926
high amount of energy. Our brain itself already consumes a

155
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:33,522
lot of energy, but it's the most energy intensive

156
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:36,902
part of our brain. Usually we believe

157
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:40,490
that this part of the brain works very synchronous,

158
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,922
which means that when we're thinking, usually we are

159
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:48,982
thinking about this part of the brain because it respond

160
00:10:49,046 --> 00:10:52,298
to what we believe as our ego.

161
00:10:52,474 --> 00:10:55,614
But also it's a part of our brain that it's very low

162
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:59,214
on memory. And when I'm talking about memory, it's about

163
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:02,894
which concept it can hold at

164
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:06,494
each single time. But you can be

165
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:10,354
thinking, like, how can it be low on memory when I can remember so many

166
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:14,062
things and I can hold these thoughts, these complex thoughts

167
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:17,378
in my head? That's because the prefrontal

168
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:20,866
cortex works with a concept

169
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:24,934
of choosing. So when you're thinking about something, you don't hold

170
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,320
that whole concept at once.

171
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,820
You try to break it into

172
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,642
smaller parts. So let's say I talk

173
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,982
to you that I live in brazilian.

174
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:42,366
So how can you hold things thought that I live in

175
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:46,014
brazilian in your head? So you can imagine that we

176
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:48,350
are in planet Earth.

177
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,682
Brazilia is in Brazil. So it's in America, then Brazil,

178
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:56,194
and then in the center of Brazil, it's where I live.

179
00:11:56,312 --> 00:12:00,500
And when I say that I want to travel to

180
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,770
Lisbon, you make your head okay, so he's getting

181
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,738
out of Brazil. He's going to go to another continent.

182
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:12,226
Things other continent. It's Europe. In Europe, there is Portugal. In Portugal,

183
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:15,522
there is Lisbon. So this chunking

184
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:19,510
that we do with maps, when you're trying to locate ourselves, is the same thing

185
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,514
in your hand. So we aggregate different contexts in

186
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:26,618
different sizes, and we hold these small

187
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,406
thoughts not at once, but in

188
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,726
small chunks at each time. The second part of

189
00:12:33,748 --> 00:12:37,470
our brain is the hippocampus. So the hippocampus is usually

190
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,454
where we store our memory. Our memory is

191
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,978
not very selective because you can

192
00:12:45,144 --> 00:12:48,754
connect different kinds of information. You can

193
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:52,174
connect and smell with an image,

194
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:55,358
with a feeling, with a sound,

195
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:59,350
and disconnections is what makes our memory

196
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,390
work so well. Usually our long term memory,

197
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,314
it's a synchronous. So when we are trying to remember

198
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,674
something, not necessarily, you're going to

199
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:15,226
get that information right away. So your brain is going to

200
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:18,614
process that information. And that's why sometimes you're

201
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:21,966
just out of the blue, you remember something,

202
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:25,086
or a feeling overwhelms me,

203
00:13:25,188 --> 00:13:29,390
overwhelms you, because it's your hypocampus working

204
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,498
asynchronously and bringing that information to you. So these

205
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:37,234
two parts of your brain, they work together to help you make

206
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:41,074
decisions. And there are some ways that you can help these two

207
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:45,074
parts to work better. And the

208
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:48,502
best way for you to help is to make these two

209
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:52,022
parts of your brain feel safe. And when we say

210
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:56,374
safe, is to ensure that they're using

211
00:13:56,572 --> 00:14:01,580
the best of their capabilities. Because when

212
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,554
you don't bring the best

213
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:10,326
of your memory CTO work, your brain

214
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:13,360
is going to still be worrying about things.

215
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,846
So that's why sometimes you're just working and in

216
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:20,702
the middle of your working session, you remember that you forgot to buy

217
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:24,678
milk and your whole flow

218
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:27,934
state is broken. So how can you help your brain

219
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:31,522
feel safer? So there are three things that you can do.

220
00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:34,834
The first is to store information outside your

221
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:38,226
brain. And why that? Because your brain

222
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:42,120
is not a very reliable place to store information,

223
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,282
because it's going to always be worrying

224
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:51,002
about what you forgot and try to bring it back

225
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,954
for you in your

226
00:14:54,992 --> 00:14:58,554
prefrontal cortex. So write down somewhere that you

227
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:02,400
believe that is going to be safe and you can find some later.

228
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,734
This will calm your brain. Also have

229
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,934
a process to review and reevaluate these

230
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:13,774
notes so your brain knows that it's really safe.

231
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:17,458
What you wrote down and

232
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:20,158
these way you wrote down is understandable.

233
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:23,918
So if you write down your notes

234
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:27,350
and sometime later you come back and you don't understand,

235
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,674
your brain will start worrying about what you wrote,

236
00:15:30,802 --> 00:15:35,142
so you will not feel safe. And the last part

237
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:39,026
is to delay decisions. When you delay decisions, you're telling

238
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:42,666
your brain, calm down, you dont need to worry about this right now.

239
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:46,586
We can work with that later. But it only work

240
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:50,326
if you can review and reevaluate. And you are storing these

241
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:53,694
delayed decisions. So your brain doesn't have to worry that

242
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:57,322
you forgot what you are delaying.

243
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:01,214
So let's see some examples. So the first example is

244
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,830
the most common for every programmer is variable naming.

245
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,178
It's very hard thing to do, even though it's simple.

246
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:12,786
So here, let's say I'm avoiding a

247
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:16,390
method to evaluate a loan, and I have to evaluate

248
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,726
the amount that a payment has. And I think that payment is

249
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:24,486
not a very good choice of words, but I

250
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:28,122
could not things of something else. So I'll just make a mark

251
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:32,282
here, I'll just call payment avocado. And why

252
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:36,538
that? Because I know that if I try to get things pr

253
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:40,700
to production, I will not make it through code review.

254
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,238
Even my own code review won't accept this.

255
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:48,174
So it's just a mark for me to remember that after

256
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:52,382
I finish my code, I have to come back here and I can just keep

257
00:16:52,436 --> 00:16:57,090
coding, finish what I have to do. And after that I can reevaluate

258
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,646
this choice of words and can come with a better choice

259
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:04,306
of words like stomach monthly value,

260
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:08,294
it's much more clear. It tells me the

261
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:12,214
time slot of that payment, and it's called

262
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:16,422
installment, so I know it's related to the loan, so it's much more clear.

263
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:20,058
So I delayed this choice and I made a better choice later.

264
00:17:20,144 --> 00:17:23,914
Instead of just breaking my flow of work and these

265
00:17:23,952 --> 00:17:27,702
small decisions, I find it helpful

266
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:32,086
CTO work using the Pomodor technique because it follows

267
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:36,142
the same process that we are talking before. That helps our brain to work better.

268
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:39,886
So you have small work sessions, you write it down and

269
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:43,822
you review afterwards and you have these time slots

270
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:47,122
like every break your brain has

271
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:51,538
some time to breathe and review what you're working with.

272
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:56,738
So I find it's very helpful. So let's see a second example.

273
00:17:56,904 --> 00:18:00,294
Like imagine you have to deliver a new behavior in an

274
00:18:00,332 --> 00:18:03,778
existing feature and there is some code that you don't

275
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:07,250
feel great about, but you are not sure how to act on it.

276
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,938
So let's say it's again our evaluate long

277
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:15,180
method with lots of code that you don't feel great.

278
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,970
So my first choice is I'll just isolate the old

279
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,286
code and code my

280
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:26,478
new code because I'm sure how it should be done. And after

281
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:30,366
I do that, I can then look at the code and see

282
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:33,906
the pattern of what I think it should be and

283
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:37,154
then I can just rewrite this code. In this case,

284
00:18:37,272 --> 00:18:40,594
I find that it'd be much better to use in this

285
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:44,938
case observable

286
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:48,726
pattern and just change the

287
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:52,518
code to be more clear. But I delayed this choice later,

288
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:55,846
after I just inserted my new code and

289
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,434
I was sure about what change should be done. And let's go

290
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:03,366
to my third example where imagine

291
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:09,206
you are tasked with adding a new steps

292
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:12,958
to a purchase flow and you should

293
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:16,782
decide, should I go top down, bottom up or

294
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:20,846
just go vertically slicing these problem? And let's see,

295
00:19:20,948 --> 00:19:24,846
imagine that you have this flow, you have a cart, and then you go straight

296
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:29,060
to a payment flow and you are requested to

297
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,662
start a new two steps in the middle that you should request documents.

298
00:19:33,726 --> 00:19:37,382
Then you have to process the information and you can go many

299
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:40,726
ways. You can go top down and

300
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:44,182
you first develop the front end for

301
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,590
these two steps and you validate, then you develop the

302
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,334
back end and you deploy everything at once. But imagine

303
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:55,162
that these team is requesting that you should

304
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:58,906
deploy it faster because they are having lots of problem with

305
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:02,622
fraud. So you can say, okay, so I'll develop

306
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:06,490
the whole request documents at once. I can give these documents

307
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,462
to the antifraud team, they can start processing it

308
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:14,062
manually while I've developed the automation about

309
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:17,986
this, so I can give some value to the team and later on I

310
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,074
can automate that. But they can say,

311
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:24,702
okay, you cannot do that. We already have some documents

312
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,030
here. So I can start with the automation and then go to the request.

313
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,342
So there are many ways that you can approach this problem, but to

314
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:36,034
depend on the context that you are within. And there is no clear choice

315
00:20:36,082 --> 00:20:40,154
here. And that's how we work. There is not

316
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:43,594
always a clear choice and you have to work with other people to

317
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:47,562
model your problem. And that brings us to

318
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:50,886
how can we choose if most of our decisions,

319
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:54,238
they are so complex. So there are some things that we can do.

320
00:20:54,404 --> 00:20:58,526
But I'll be honest, there is no single way

321
00:20:58,628 --> 00:21:02,478
to choose and no one knows how to make you

322
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:06,622
go to a better choice, to a single optimized

323
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:09,426
choice. But there are ways that can help you.

324
00:21:09,528 --> 00:21:13,394
So the first one is to use these same way that your brain works.

325
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:17,254
So it's chunking you brain big things into

326
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:20,598
smaller things. And these you

327
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:24,674
can solve smaller problems into a bigger problem and compose

328
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:28,402
that. Also you can ask for advice,

329
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:32,106
ask for people that already worked in

330
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:35,594
similar contexts and how they solve it. This will inspire you

331
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:39,386
in how you can solve that problem. Not necessarily use the

332
00:21:39,408 --> 00:21:42,814
same solutions, but you can be inspired to bring your

333
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:46,526
own solutions and know how their hardships can

334
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:50,394
be met to yours. And lastly, you weight

335
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:53,646
your choices and choose using one or more methods.

336
00:21:53,758 --> 00:21:57,762
And there are hundreds of methods of choice or

337
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,950
choosing. You have pros and cons, you have AHP,

338
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,640
you have contract analysis and many others.

339
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,566
In my opinion, most of the methods, these are specific

340
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:14,294
types of AHP, analytic hierarchy process.

341
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:18,982
And I'll show you here how it works. It's basically a matrix

342
00:22:19,126 --> 00:22:21,930
where you have your options, your criteria,

343
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,786
and in the end you weight your criteria to get to

344
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:28,358
a ranking. In my opinion,

345
00:22:28,534 --> 00:22:31,854
the best part of doing this

346
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,498
kind of process is to come up with criteria.

347
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:39,326
When you're working towards establishing the

348
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:42,950
criteria that will distinguish your alternatives,

349
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:48,354
you come up with your

350
00:22:48,392 --> 00:22:51,762
problem model. And this is the best part,

351
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:55,554
because when you're modeling your problem, you find

352
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:59,510
out what really matters and it will guide you towards

353
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,346
a better decision. Not always you have the best decision

354
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:06,934
in these end, but you can find the best decision at that

355
00:23:06,972 --> 00:23:10,642
time. And also when you wait your criteria

356
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:14,474
and you come up with the ranking, you can compare that and you can

357
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:18,246
find out if that matches what you expected. So let's

358
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:22,174
bring the first example of this talk. And let's say you

359
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:26,078
wanted to choose which payment gateway you should use,

360
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:30,010
and you end up with these three criteria.

361
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,290
Familiarity of the team with that payment gateway, the coverage,

362
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,014
consolidating the business and how pricing can affect

363
00:23:38,062 --> 00:23:41,678
you. And let's say you end up with this score

364
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:45,090
and in this case, you have a tie in the second

365
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,614
place, but you have a clear fourth place and a clear first

366
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:52,520
place. And this model can help you

367
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,134
understand how you can choose one here. You can say,

368
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:59,574
okay, so people it is, it's the first one, you should choose

369
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:03,722
it, but not necessarily. You can go and talk with other people

370
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:07,050
and they say okay, so pricing is good and everything else,

371
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,730
but I believe we can negotiate and get something better

372
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,106
because I have someone that I know at stripe

373
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:17,706
that can help us out. There is things incentive because we're

374
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:21,470
a startup, so you can choose it or something

375
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,194
like, oh, the coverage is okay, you give a tree,

376
00:24:25,242 --> 00:24:28,942
but it's not necessarily a these. And discussion

377
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:33,266
can go even further. But the

378
00:24:33,288 --> 00:24:36,834
modeling of these three criterias is what

379
00:24:36,872 --> 00:24:39,958
will help you guide you and choose in

380
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:43,958
the end. And you can negotiate with other people and end up with a

381
00:24:43,964 --> 00:24:47,426
better solution. So let's review what we talked today.

382
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:51,770
So first, to calm your brain and bring safe safety

383
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,220
into your mind. Remember to always store your information,

384
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,146
take notes, always have a slot

385
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:05,082
of time saved to review and reevaluate

386
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:09,114
what you wrote and replan and establish

387
00:25:09,162 --> 00:25:12,846
a cadency of when you're doing this, when you're

388
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,794
delaying your decisions. Also,

389
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:19,234
don't overdo it. Look for help when you need

390
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:23,310
it. Evaluate different methods of choosing

391
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,706
and in the end, don't overthink. If you're overthinking,

392
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:30,482
you are not choosing. It's better sometimes to make a choice

393
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:33,810
and go with it. Experiment sometime

394
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,478
and then you can come back and make a different choice. Remember,

395
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:41,506
choosing, not always is a commitment. Sometimes it's

396
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:45,990
just an experiment and you can come back and try other methods.

397
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,950
So that's it. Thanks a lot and I hope,

398
