1
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,826
With GitHub actions. A Prometheus deployments example the agenda

2
00:00:45,858 --> 00:00:49,074
for today is we will deploy Prometheus in AWS

3
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:52,714
EC two instance using Bitovi's seamless GitHub action

4
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:56,954
we will explore Bitovi's open source deploy Prometheus GitHub

5
00:00:57,002 --> 00:01:00,922
action. We will also explore Bitovi's open source framework,

6
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:04,414
referred as commons, which ensures seamless integration

7
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:07,554
of IAC tools such as terraform and

8
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:10,862
ansible. At the end of this session,

9
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:14,094
you'll be able to leverage the power of GitHub actions

10
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:18,146
as a platform engineering. You'll also witness live deployment

11
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,906
of Prometheus using Bitovis GitHub action. You will get insights

12
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:25,762
into the Bitovis action repository. You will also discover

13
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:29,766
that how Bitovi's internal frameworks commons

14
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:33,750
ensure seamless integration of tools such as terraform

15
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,734
and ansible without user worrying about installing

16
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:41,242
or setup of these tools. Here we have a deployments

17
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:44,926
repository in which user defines workflow, which would

18
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:48,634
call Bitovi's GitHub action to deploy Prometheus

19
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:52,350
and Grafana. Let's see the content of this repository.

20
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,558
Under observability folder we have configuration

21
00:01:56,654 --> 00:02:00,606
related to Prometheus and Grafana, such as under Prometheus

22
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,094
we have scrape targets for Prometheus to scrape

23
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:08,022
metrics from. Similarly, under Grafana we have a data

24
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:11,574
source for Grafana. Let's see the content of

25
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:15,586
workflow file. Under workflow

26
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:18,966
file we are calling Bitovi's

27
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:23,110
GitHub action to deploy Prometheus and Grafana.

28
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,774
You can also see that we are providing mandatory

29
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:30,086
parameters aw access key id and

30
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,106
secret access key to deploy Prometheus and Grafana

31
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:38,350
in AWS EC two instance. Along with this, you can also

32
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,202
pass AWS default region to deploy Prometheus

33
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:46,014
in and similarly you can also specify which EC two instance

34
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:50,350
type you want. Finally, you can see that we are passing

35
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,300
the path for our configuration files here.

36
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,910
Let's make a small change into the workflow file.

37
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,194
I'm going to comment this line and I'm going to commit these changes directly

38
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,320
into the main.

39
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,782
Once these changes are committed directly into the main branch,

40
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:15,382
the workflow would make use of Bitovis GitHub

41
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:18,746
action and Commons to deploy Prometheus and

42
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:21,150
Grafana in EC two instance.

43
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,250
In the meantime, till this workflow is complex,

44
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,758
let's see what's inside the action repository and what is

45
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:33,042
Commons framework. We will start

46
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:36,846
by exploring Bitovis GitHub action

47
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,466
repository. Let's see the action file for the

48
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:43,874
Bitovis GitHub action repository. Here you can see that

49
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:47,574
we have all the inputs are exposed to make use by

50
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:51,366
developers. Any steps such

51
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:54,994
as ISE, any scripts or commands are defined

52
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:59,114
into the steps. For example, we are copying all the

53
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,314
configuration later to Prometheus and Grafana at

54
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:05,542
appropriate destination. Similarly,

55
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:09,366
we are also calling Bitovi's internal framework named

56
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:13,134
as GitHub action Commons. Here you can see

57
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,974
that we have passed this input parameter where

58
00:04:17,012 --> 00:04:20,814
we are specifying that the input for our ansible is

59
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:24,098
at path. This in the similar

60
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:27,746
way you can specify your path for other tools such

61
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,234
as terraform and helm. And then Commons would make

62
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:35,398
sure that your

63
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:39,858
deployments are ready without you to concern about deploying

64
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:44,390
or installing terraform, ansible or any IAC tools.

65
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,714
Let's see the overall structure of

66
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:52,374
commons repository as I shown you that in action

67
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,674
we have certain kind of parameter. You can see that

68
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,318
if your deployment require terraforms,

69
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:03,102
you can specify the path of terraform using

70
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:07,082
this input parameter. Similarly, you can specify the input

71
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:11,198
for ansible and helm, and then Commons would make sure

72
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:15,230
that the deployment is ready using appropriate IAC tools.

73
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,070
Commons is trying to run few scripts

74
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,314
and these scripts make sure that the code from deployment

75
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:30,614
and action repo is merged together and

76
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:34,520
it's defined in an order way for Bitovis to

77
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,440
construct Ise as infrastructure as code.

78
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,742
Let's explore all these repositories from diagram

79
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:52,762
point of view. You can see that we have three repositories

80
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:56,670
deployment repository, action Repo and comma repo.

81
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,198
Deployment repo is used by user user would create

82
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:05,550
workflow which would further call Bitovi's internal GitHub action.

83
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,694
In Bintovi's internal GitHub action, we specify the deployments

84
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:13,342
of tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, which further

85
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,186
call Bitovi's internal framework referred as common, which is can

86
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,950
open source framework commons. Make sure

87
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,546
that your deployments is ready without you worrying

88
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:28,270
about installing or setup any of IAC tools

89
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,330
such as terraform or ansible.

90
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,382
Commons is a wrapper around the bitops.

91
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:39,318
Bitops has baked in terraform and ansible

92
00:06:39,414 --> 00:06:43,194
as containers commons also make sure to organize

93
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:47,898
the structure of repository by merging the content of deployment repository

94
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:52,030
and action repository commons also expose the

95
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,198
output in a way so that they can be reused.

96
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:59,362
This is all about deployments. Repository action repository common

97
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,622
repository you can very easily leverage

98
00:07:02,686 --> 00:07:06,642
the power of commons and action without setting up any

99
00:07:06,696 --> 00:07:10,214
of IAC tools. Let's see the

100
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:13,574
status of our actions. You can see that

101
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:17,074
our action has been completed successfully. Now let's see the status

102
00:07:17,122 --> 00:07:19,290
of this into the EC two instance,

103
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,630
our deployment for Prometheus and Grafana would be accessible

104
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,106
at this IP address along with its respective port

105
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:32,960
such as for Prometheus. We are making use of port number 9090

106
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,694
here you can see that we have our Prometheus deployments ready

107
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:47,630
and from our status we can see the targets

108
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,166
and we have our target up and healthy. So this is all about

109
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,546
Bitovis GitHub action and Bitovis Open source

110
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:57,990
framework Commons.

111
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:03,958
Let us know if you have any questions or you need help setting your

112
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:06,580
environment using platform Engineering. Thank you.
