1
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,190
Hey, friends, I'm going to kick things off today with a story.

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,646
Well, an embarrassing story. So back when I

3
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:35,074
was working on my master's degree in computer science, I had to write a thesis.

4
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:38,998
And a thesis is this massive paper where you explain your research

5
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,966
and how it contributes to the larger body of work. Now,

6
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:45,910
I diligently worked on my thesis over time,

7
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,838
and looking back, I should have sent it to my professor every time,

8
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:53,454
finished a chapter. But I was never really

9
00:00:53,492 --> 00:00:56,974
thrilled with what I had written, so I just kept chipping away at it on

10
00:00:57,012 --> 00:01:00,366
my own. Now, eventually, I finished the

11
00:01:00,388 --> 00:01:04,190
first draft and I had to send it to my professor.

12
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,046
I needed to know if it was any good. My graduation depended

13
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:11,090
on it. So I sent it to her.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,930
The whole thing, all 83 pages,

15
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,270
and she didn't reply. I knew she had it,

16
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,630
but she was a busy professor with lots going on, and she didn't have time

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,120
to read an entire massive paper all in one night.

18
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,510
So I anxiously awaited her reply.

19
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,674
I don't even remember how much time passed, but I got more and more

20
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:36,922
nervous by the hour. I was totally in my head. I was asking

21
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:40,470
myself questions like, how much was I going to have to rework?

22
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,046
Was I going to be able to graduate on time? Was I just bad at

23
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:47,534
this whole grad school thing? Now, eventually she

24
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:51,406
replied, and she liked it. She had

25
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:54,754
recommendations, of course, like, it wasn't perfect, but her

26
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:58,226
overall review was positive. I wasn't going to have

27
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:01,538
to redo my research or rewrite the whole thing.

28
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:05,646
Graduation was within my grasp. I was absolutely

29
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:09,250
thrilled. So I was so excited.

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,190
And I'm a millennial who's very attached to their mom.

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,240
So I decided I should forward this email to my mom. I started typing out,

32
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,046
mom, I'm so excited. My professor liked it. I'm going to

33
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:24,538
graduate. Book your flight. I'm going to graduate. This is great.

34
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:28,266
Now, I initially threw in a little shade about someone else, and then

35
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:31,680
I deleted that part about the other person and I pressed send.

36
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,174
And that is when I realized my mistake. I had

37
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:40,174
not forwarded the email to my mom, I had forwarded it to my

38
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:44,130
professor, and there was no way to stop

39
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,820
it.

40
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,690
And so off it went into her inbox,

41
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,278
and I was mortified. And I was super glad that I'd removed

42
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:58,266
the shade about the other person. Now, luckily,

43
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,494
my professor was very cool about the whole thing and she didn't hang it over

44
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,990
me. But I remained embarrassed.

45
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,914
And I also learned about Google's undo send that day because

46
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:11,930
for some reason, mistakes become so much more obvious. When you actually

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,940
press send.

48
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,900
So let's have a moment of solidarity together.

49
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,950
Just think about it. Has your writing ever gotten you into trouble?

50
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,646
Maybe you sent an email or a chat message that didn't go to

51
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:29,006
the person or group you intended. Maybe your tone was

52
00:03:29,028 --> 00:03:33,070
a little snotty, either intentionally or unintentionally.

53
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,406
Or maybe you missed an opportunity because the reader just didn't

54
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,214
understand what you meant. The written

55
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,306
word is powerful. It can get you into

56
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:48,358
trouble if you're not careful. But it also has the power

57
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,870
to level up your career.

58
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,286
We're all writing every day. A recent study found

59
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:59,334
that knowledge workers spend about 20 hours a week. That's roughly

60
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:02,650
half our work week on written communication.

61
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,066
Writing is super important, and it's hard to get it right.

62
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,498
Much like writing code, if you use the wrong word, you misplace

63
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:12,880
a character. Youll can get it all wrong,

64
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,390
but when you get it right, it feels so good

65
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,790
and the impact can be massive.

66
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,020
Your writing has the power to improve your personal success

67
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,370
and your personal reputation.

68
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,126
Over the next few minutes, I'm going to share with you five concrete strategies

69
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,506
for writing to level up your career. And then

70
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,854
I'll share three ways that you can improve the quality of your

71
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:42,514
writing. Okay, so let's just dive right in with strategies

72
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:45,030
for writing in order to level up your career.

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,530
First, strategies write to help your

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,922
users. So, jumping back

75
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:56,326
a little more backstory on me. After grad

76
00:04:56,358 --> 00:05:00,234
school, I started working as a software engineer. I chipped away

77
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:04,206
at my coding projects at work. I started getting comfortable with them,

78
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:07,614
and then I asked my manager what I needed to do in order to move

79
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:11,402
my career forward. He emphasized the importance

80
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,994
of demonstrating scope I needed to show that

81
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:17,540
I was influencing and helping others.

82
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,154
So he recommended that I begin answering questions on

83
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:24,466
our user forums. Now, I got to tell you, this was

84
00:05:24,488 --> 00:05:28,066
a little scary to me at the time. I certainly was not an expert

85
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:31,394
on our products, and I didn't want to look dumb in front of my colleagues

86
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:34,150
who would be reading my public answers.

87
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,240
But I decided to try it anyway.

88
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,642
So I set a goal for myself to answer one question each

89
00:05:41,696 --> 00:05:45,258
day. In the beginning, I had to really

90
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,380
search for a question that I had a clue how to answer.

91
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,206
I often had to code the solution myself to figure out if what

92
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,800
I thought would work would actually work.

93
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,840
The first time someone marked my answer as correct felt amazing,

94
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,302
like I, a new grad, had helped a professional like

95
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:07,540
out in the real world. That was so cool.

96
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,394
Now, I'm not going to pretend I always got my answers 100% right? I mean,

97
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:14,974
sometimes my colleagues would drop in and add suggestions to my answers

98
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:18,598
and sometimes I wouldn't receive any feedback at all and I would have no

99
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:21,640
idea if my answers were helping other people.

100
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,246
But over time, I learned more about our product

101
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,840
and I got better at answering questions.

102
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,402
So I kept at it and I continued to try and answer one

103
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:37,126
question a day. My reputation points grew

104
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:40,702
a little bit each day and I eventually ranked in the top 1%

105
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:43,920
of users on our forums in terms of reputation points.

106
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,474
End users, as well as colleagues from other offices

107
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:52,240
who I'd never met, began to recognize my name.

108
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,890
Writing was starting to give me visibility,

109
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,314
and I just share this to show that little bits of writing every

110
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,890
day add up over the long term.

111
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,446
Once I was somewhat confidently answering questions on our user forums,

112
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,318
I went back to my manager and was like, hey, what do I need to

113
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:14,998
do to progress my career? And he suggested that

114
00:07:15,004 --> 00:07:18,806
I start writing posts on our company blog. Once again,

115
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:22,218
this was new and scary. I remember

116
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:25,894
just staring at a blank screen and thinking, oh my gosh,

117
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:30,010
how am I going to sound competent when I have to write so many

118
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,866
words? But I pushed through the discomfort

119
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:37,274
and I published a post and then I kept

120
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:41,294
going, becoming a very frequent author on our blog and these

121
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:44,866
activities are part of what led to my current role as a developer advocate at

122
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:48,674
Grammarly, whose mission is to improve lives by

123
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:52,254
improving communication. I was able to take the writing

124
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:55,746
skills I developed over my years as a software engineer and then

125
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:58,920
turn them into a core part of a career that I love.

126
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,054
Writing to users improved my career at a company where I was

127
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:08,120
working and then helped me pivot to a slightly different career at other companies.

128
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,986
All right, that's enough about me. Let's look about you and how you can

129
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:17,034
write to help your users. Your users might be internal at

130
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:20,060
your company or external users of your product.

131
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,220
Whatever the case, write to them. Help them.

132
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,094
There are so many ways you can do this, and what makes sense for you

133
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,566
will be customized for your company and your role. But let me give you

134
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:35,554
some ideas. You can answer questions in

135
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:39,326
forums. You can write blog posts and tutorials

136
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:43,010
on your company's blog. You can write documentation.

137
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,750
You can respond to users bug reports and requests for features.

138
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,270
You can write reason for outage reports.

139
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,470
You can email your users.

140
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,610
You can chat with your users on platforms like Slack or discord.

141
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,210
Or you can even curate a newsletter.

142
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,934
Perhaps you're thinking, why bother?

143
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:10,686
This seems like a lot of work. Well, these are

144
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:14,000
the sorts of things that can impact your company's bottom line.

145
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:18,670
If your users are unhappy or confused or frustrated.

146
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,526
Your role, your team, or your company may not

147
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:26,210
be around for long. Now, you might also be thinking,

148
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,538
well, this sounds great, but writing to my users is not one of

149
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:32,914
my core responsibilities. How can I possibly make

150
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:36,766
time for this? I encourage you to take a look at your career

151
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:39,846
ladder or talk with your manager to discover what you need

152
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:43,014
to do to progress to the next level. I've looked

153
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:46,994
at a lot of technical career ladders, and almost all of them require

154
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:50,810
you to demonstrate scope and influence.

155
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,482
Showing that you're impacting your users through personalized help or more

156
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:59,018
broadly on a larger, less personalized scale is a great way to

157
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:02,462
do that. All right, so write

158
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:05,754
to help your users. Second strategy for writing

159
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:09,678
in order to level up your career is to write

160
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:13,322
to educate the tech community. I believe that

161
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:16,610
everyone has a story to tell. Seriously.

162
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,660
Maybe you've worked really hard to become an expert in a technology.

163
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,100
You've got a story, you can share what you know.

164
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,040
Maybe you're in the process of learning something new.

165
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,386
Share as you learn. This is a great way to reinforce

166
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:37,586
your learning. Or maybe youll have failed spectacularly.

167
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:40,970
Share your story so we don't make the same mistakes.

168
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,754
You can share your technical skills as well as your

169
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:48,570
soft skills, or some people call them core skills.

170
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,734
I've written about a variety of topics on everything from

171
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:57,130
data modeling to how to be successful remote employee

172
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,214
to how to theme the Grammarly text editor SDK to

173
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:05,298
match Taylor Swift albums. One of

174
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:09,022
the great things about the tech community is that we are lifelong learners.

175
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,146
We want to continuously improve and grow.

176
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:15,878
So share what you've learned. So here are

177
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,840
some ways that you can write to educate the tech community.

178
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,994
You can answer questions on sites like Stack,

179
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:27,014
overflow or Dev. You can participate in

180
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:29,530
discussions on open source projects.

181
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,810
You can chat in tech communities on platforms like Discord and Slack.

182
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,950
You can share micro content on platforms like Twitter,

183
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,446
LinkedIn, or Instagram. You can

184
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,722
write tutorials or thought leadership articles on your own blog

185
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:49,230
or on platforms like Dev Medium or LinkedIn.

186
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,300
Or you can really go for it and write a book.

187
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,402
So why do this? Well, I think there are two main

188
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,620
reasons. First up, you can help others.

189
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,474
It feels so good when someone comes back

190
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:09,080
and tells you that what you wrote helped them solve their problem.

191
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,800
But two, a little more selfishly, you can help yourself.

192
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,310
The more you write, the more you will become known as the go to

193
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,862
person on a topic that's going to help you demonstrate

194
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:25,338
scope and influence in your current role. And it's going to

195
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,930
get your name out there for potential new roles.

196
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,794
For me, writing to the tech community is probably the scariest suggestion

197
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:36,014
that I'm going to make today. And from talking with others,

198
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:39,374
many people also fear writing in public. Not just

199
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:43,294
speaking in public, writing in public. I've been asked

200
00:12:43,332 --> 00:12:47,106
questions like, what if I write something dumb or wrong and

201
00:12:47,128 --> 00:12:50,882
people call me out on it? I mean, people on the Internet can

202
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,986
be mean. Chances are

203
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:57,430
good you're probably going to get a few mean comments. There's no getting around that.

204
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,046
You're going to have to focus on the positive comments and learn to

205
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:04,674
let go of the negative and to be transparent.

206
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:08,454
It's easier said than done. It doesn't matter how many

207
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:12,042
kind comments I get, one mean community will wriggle around

208
00:13:12,096 --> 00:13:15,706
in my brain for days. So if

209
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,886
you start to feel dragged down by the mean comments, just go back and reread

210
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:22,058
the good ones. But you can also work to

211
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:25,930
prevent some of them by having a trusted friend or colleague

212
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,434
read your work before you publish it to spot check it for any glaring

213
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:33,454
technical errors. You can also use a human or

214
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:37,810
a tool to spot check your writing for spelling grammar mistakes.

215
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,114
Getting both a technical review and a copy edit review

216
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:45,670
will give you more confidence when you go to click publish.

217
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:50,200
In the end, writing for the tech community will be worth it.

218
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,990
Okay, third way to write to level up your career.

219
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,866
Write to document team knowledge I

220
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:05,258
love this gift from parks and rec where the mayor says,

221
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:09,206
if there's praise, I will humbly accept it, but if there's blame,

222
00:14:09,318 --> 00:14:13,230
it's your fault. Have you ever looked at code and asked yourself,

223
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,654
who wrote this nonsense? This code doesn't make

224
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:20,206
any sense and there are no community to explain what's going on.

225
00:14:20,388 --> 00:14:23,540
And then you checked the git blame and realized that it was you.

226
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,740
Yeah, me neither. Moving on.

227
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,446
We all have opportunities each day to improve the daily

228
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:34,046
work of our teammates, and potentially for our future selves

229
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:37,990
by documenting team knowledge. So here are some guidelines.

230
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,898
If you find yourself answering a question more than once, either verbally

231
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:46,262
or in a chat, find a way to document it.

232
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:49,026
Maybe you drop it in a readme, or maybe you put it in a team

233
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:52,166
wiki, but drop it somewhere that others can easily

234
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:55,626
discover it. Point people to it, and then ask them

235
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:58,140
to improve it if it doesn't fully answer their question.

236
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,754
When you make a decision on your own or as a team,

237
00:15:03,952 --> 00:15:06,782
document the decision and why you chose it.

238
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:09,934
This doesn't have to be a big, huge document. I mean, if it is,

239
00:15:09,972 --> 00:15:13,646
that's great, but it can also just be like a quick paragraph that summarizes

240
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:17,426
what you chose, with some bullets below it about other options that you

241
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:21,646
considered and why you didn't choose them. Future teammates

242
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:24,842
and future you will appreciate this context,

243
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:28,438
and it can prevent you from having to revisit the same decision again in

244
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:29,160
the future.

245
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,394
Finally, document team processes it's

246
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:39,126
nice to feel needed, but it's not nice to feel needed at 03:00 a.m.

247
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:42,026
When the person on call can't figure out how to fix a problem in your

248
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:44,700
area, so they call and wake you up.

249
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,702
Document team knowledge and processes so that your team can easily

250
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:53,150
keep moving forward, even if a key person is offline.

251
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,390
All right, fourth strategy. Write to

252
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,614
encourage your teammates have you ever

253
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:06,446
worked with someone who's a natural encourager?

254
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:09,746
Kindness just seems to ooze out of them.

255
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:13,394
They're always ready to compliment your latest pull request or

256
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:17,126
the way you ran a meeting, or how cute your shoes are.

257
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:20,840
It feels so good to be around them right

258
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,170
now. Most of us are not natural encouragers.

259
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,026
We might occasionally remember to say something kind when someone goes above

260
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:32,966
and beyond, but otherwise we just stay focused on our jobs.

261
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,954
I am very much the second type. My husband will tell you that

262
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:40,182
I am quick to criticize and slow to praise.

263
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:43,946
He loves that about me. I'm very task

264
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:47,550
oriented and I tend to focus on accomplishing my tasks.

265
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,710
When I feel overwhelmed and behind on my work, I go even

266
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,530
deeper inside this bubble of solitude.

267
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,970
When I was at my previous company, I decided to be more intentional about

268
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,806
celebrating the successes of my teammates. When someone shared

269
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:07,970
something they'd accomplished in our team chat, I made sure to celebrate it with them.

270
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,746
When I saw someone doing good work, I complimented them publicly

271
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:15,174
in our team chat. And when someone did something to help

272
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:18,294
me out, I made sure to thank them through our company's platform

273
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,994
for recognizing others. To be clear, this was not something

274
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:25,702
that came naturally to me. This was something I chose to intentionally

275
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:28,826
do. Shortly after I left that company,

276
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:32,222
a former colleague, Megan, tweeted this. She said,

277
00:17:32,356 --> 00:17:35,466
we still talk about youll and how amazing and brilliant

278
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:38,798
and kind you are. And I was like, what,

279
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:42,186
me kind? They had noticed

280
00:17:42,218 --> 00:17:44,740
and appreciated my efforts to be kind.

281
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,206
Tell your teammates that you appreciate them and that they belong.

282
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:52,850
They are going to thrive in this environment.

283
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,410
I encourage you to be intentional in encouraging your teammates.

284
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,362
If you're likely to forget, set a reminder on your calendar every Friday

285
00:18:01,426 --> 00:18:05,062
to encourage a teammate. When someone does great work,

286
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:08,886
celebrate it and let others know about it. If your

287
00:18:08,908 --> 00:18:12,326
company doesn't have a platform like bonusly or lattice for sending

288
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,702
public compliments. You can post them in team chats

289
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:19,674
or send an email to the person and CC your manager and

290
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:23,242
CC their manager. The person you're thanking

291
00:18:23,306 --> 00:18:26,762
will appreciate it, and it's going to give both managers

292
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,040
visibility into what you're working on.

293
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,466
All of these efforts can help create a culture of compliments on

294
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,870
your team. When you start recognizing other strengths,

295
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,554
they're likely to start recognizing yours. And that's a win for

296
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:44,754
everybody. Which leads to my last point in this

297
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,870
section. Write to record your accomplishments.

298
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,314
Now, I don't know about you, but I have to write a performance

299
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:57,586
review every year. And every year I kind of dread

300
00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:01,130
this process. Here's the thing.

301
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,114
Your performance review is your chance to make a case for yourself as to why

302
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:08,826
your manager should give you a bonus, a raise, or a

303
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:13,034
promotion. Do not waste

304
00:19:13,082 --> 00:19:17,006
your performance review I know you'd rather be doing something technical than

305
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:20,958
working on your performance review. But do

306
00:19:21,044 --> 00:19:24,818
not waste your performance review. I write

307
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:28,974
the longest, most detailed performance reviews. I format

308
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:32,674
them. I bold the key points. It's possibly a bit over

309
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:35,460
the top, but it works.

310
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,506
Managers are busy. It's easy for them to overlook or forget

311
00:19:39,538 --> 00:19:43,142
your accomplishments. Your performance review is your chance

312
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:46,534
to remind them of all the amazing things you've done so

313
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:50,140
that they can go advocate for you. So here's what I recommend

314
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,886
throughout the year, regularly document what you've accomplished.

315
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:59,046
If you typically track all of your work in your to dos in task tracking

316
00:19:59,078 --> 00:20:02,940
software like Jira or Asana, you're good to go.

317
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,734
But if you track the main step from your team in one place and then

318
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,222
you end up tracking other to do's in a list that ultimately gets

319
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,602
deleted or thrown away. Set aside time,

320
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:17,266
weekly or monthly, to document what you've accomplished and who

321
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,862
you've helped. Whenever you get a compliment,

322
00:20:21,006 --> 00:20:24,050
drop it in a doc dedicated just to compliments.

323
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,146
When it's time for your performance review, you can group items together into bigger

324
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:34,562
themes. Then copy and paste in any relevant compliments

325
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:39,098
and state what you've accomplished. Don't undersell yourself.

326
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:43,062
This is not the time to be humble. Tell your manager

327
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:46,666
what you've accomplished, the impact it had, and how

328
00:20:46,688 --> 00:20:49,660
it moved your team's or your company's goals forward.

329
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,510
Make it super easy for your manager to make a case for your raise

330
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,754
after you've done this. Update your resume, your CV, your LinkedIn,

331
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:03,150
whatever you use to show potential employers what you've accomplished.

332
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,866
You're probably not going to remember the impact you had three years from now when

333
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:10,740
you need it updated, so write it down now while it's fresh in your mind.

334
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,830
Over time, your resume is going to become really strong if you do this regularly.

335
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,734
Now, for me personally, LinkedIn has been huge for my

336
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:23,010
career. I got my last two jobs through LinkedIn,

337
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:27,110
and I've also gotten speaking opportunities through LinkedIn.

338
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,026
Taking the time to document your accomplishments and your impact can

339
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:35,414
help you at your current company and help your career prospects

340
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:39,046
at other companies as well. When you're

341
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:42,666
having a down day, maybe you're feeling like an imposter or

342
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:46,046
that your work isn't living up to your standards. You can open up your

343
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:49,294
compliments, doc or your performance review. It's a

344
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:52,758
great pick me up to see the amazing things you've accomplished

345
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:55,460
and all the nice things people have said about you.

346
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,346
All right, so let's recap five strategies for writing to

347
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:07,106
level up your career. Write to

348
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:11,142
help your users. Write to educate the tech

349
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:15,270
community, right to document team knowledge,

350
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:19,922
right to encourage your teammates, and right

351
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:23,546
to record your accomplishments. And I

352
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:27,302
encourage you to pause and think right now. What strategy

353
00:22:27,366 --> 00:22:29,580
can you try over the next month?

354
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,518
Write it down. Make a commitment to yourself. What do you want to

355
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:38,494
try out now?

356
00:22:38,612 --> 00:22:41,006
Now that we've talked about the ways that you can write to level up your

357
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:44,990
career, you might be concerned about the quality of your writing.

358
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,258
How are you going to make sure you write in a way that people understand

359
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:52,418
what you're trying to convey? I'm going to share with you three ways

360
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,090
you can improve the quality of your writing.

361
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,670
So this might seem super obvious, but it's super important,

362
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,110
so I'm going to share it anyway. Don't be a jerk.

363
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,238
I've created this very scientific scale of being a

364
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:10,682
jerk. So down at the bottom, we have those times when you

365
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:14,506
intentionally act like a jerk. Perhaps it makes you feel better to

366
00:23:14,528 --> 00:23:18,522
put others down. Up at the top, we have those times

367
00:23:18,576 --> 00:23:21,634
when you're unintentionally accidentally being a jerk.

368
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:25,082
Maybe you don't realize that the words you're using negatively impact

369
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:29,150
others, or that others may misinterpret the tone in your writing.

370
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,742
Now, to be totally transparent, I've done things all over the scale.

371
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:37,954
I'm not proud of it, but it's happened. So what

372
00:23:37,992 --> 00:23:40,450
can we do to not fall on the scale?

373
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,866
Well, be empathetic. Put yourself in

374
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:48,534
your reader's shoes. They don't want to feel dumb or

375
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:52,230
that their technology of choice is somehow lesser than yours.

376
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,546
As the old saying goes, you catch more flies with honey

377
00:23:56,578 --> 00:23:59,938
than vinegar. So don't put others down because you're likely to

378
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:03,574
lose them as a reader. Now, up at the top of the scale,

379
00:24:03,622 --> 00:24:07,450
we have those times when you're unintentionally accidentally being a jerk.

380
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,470
It's kind of easy to unintentionally be a jerk in your writing.

381
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,560
The words you choose matter.

382
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,126
So use inclusive language, even if you

383
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:23,566
don't care about being inclusive. For the sake of being inclusive,

384
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:26,900
be inclusive for the sake of getting your message across.

385
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,566
I recommend perusing Google's developer documentation style

386
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:35,410
guide to get recommendations on words to avoid.

387
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,286
Now, full disclosure, I'm a Grammarly employee, but I feel

388
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:43,078
like I need to throw out there that there are tools like Grammarly that provide

389
00:24:43,164 --> 00:24:46,786
suggestions on inclusive language. Your tone

390
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,234
can also get you into trouble because you know exactly what you're trying

391
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:54,010
to convey, but your readers may not. So this is another

392
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,594
case where having someone else, either a human or a tool like

393
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:59,340
Grammarly, can really help.

394
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,190
Last point of not being a jerk every time you write to someone

395
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,402
else, either privately or publicly,

396
00:25:07,546 --> 00:25:11,006
is a chance to make their day a little bit brighter or a little

397
00:25:11,028 --> 00:25:14,194
bit crummier. So I encourage youll to

398
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:17,970
use your words to make someone else's day a little bit brighter.

399
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,166
My former teammate Mark Smith included a fun gift whenever

400
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:27,410
he accepted someone's pr, and this always made my day a little brighter.

401
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,938
I have a colleague now who uses emojis to share his appreciation

402
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:35,334
and when he thinks someone's done a good job and it makes us all feel

403
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:38,806
so good. So use your words and

404
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,730
youll gifts and your emojis to make someone's day a little brighter.

405
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,494
The second way you're going to improve the quality of your writing is to practice.

406
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:51,174
Just do it. I encourage you to regularly set aside

407
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:54,734
time for writing. At about the same

408
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:58,606
time that I started writing technical blog posts at work, I decided to

409
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:02,814
start a personal blog where I wrote about anything that interested me.

410
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:06,734
Now, ultimately, my blog never took off. I never became Internet famous

411
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:10,930
because of it, but I got a ton of practice writing.

412
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,322
My goal was to write two posts a week, and I did that consistently

413
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:19,080
for a little over a year. Were my posts good?

414
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,130
But my blog allowed me to develop my personal voice,

415
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,430
which I still use today. In my professional writing,

416
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,498
I'm able to write higher quality articles and write

417
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:34,986
faster than I did years ago, and that's because of all

418
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:36,700
of the practice that I have.

419
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,090
So I encourage you set aside time to write regularly.

420
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:45,822
Now, earlier in this talk, we talked about five strategies to write

421
00:26:45,876 --> 00:26:49,214
to level up your career, and I encourage you to pick one way

422
00:26:49,332 --> 00:26:52,686
now. Put a block on your calendar to do that.

423
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:55,906
Maybe you want a daily reminder for shorter content,

424
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:59,394
or maybe you want a weekly reminder for monthly content.

425
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:02,580
But set aside the time and follow through.

426
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:05,890
You will get better just by practicing.

427
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,266
All right, my final recommendation for you today is to educate

428
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:14,646
yourself on how to be a better wider there are a few different ways you

429
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,454
can do this. You can use an aipowered writing

430
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:21,626
assistant like Grammarly that will teach you as it

431
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:25,386
reviews your content. Another way

432
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:28,906
to educate yourself is to find a writing partner. You can

433
00:27:28,928 --> 00:27:32,438
set up regular writing reviews to get feedback. This will help you

434
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:35,806
improve your writing and hold you accountable to following through on

435
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:38,400
your commitment to write, which is a win win.

436
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,906
Look for patterns in their feedback, identify your weaknesses

437
00:27:43,018 --> 00:27:44,590
and work to improve.

438
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,226
There are so many ways to learn to be a better writer. You can

439
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:53,842
read a book. I know I've got docs for developers. It's on my current

440
00:27:53,896 --> 00:27:57,410
reading list. There are excellent articles available

441
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,618
for free online. You can attend workshops. Megan Grant and I led

442
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:05,362
a workshop last fall on how to get your first technical article published.

443
00:28:05,506 --> 00:28:09,674
Or you can take an online course. Lots of options out there, so see

444
00:28:09,712 --> 00:28:11,850
what works for you. Give it a shot.

445
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,514
Let's recap. So at the beginning of this presentation, I shared five

446
00:28:17,552 --> 00:28:20,858
strategies for writing in order to level up your career.

447
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:24,446
And then I shared three ways to improve the quality of your

448
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:27,710
writing. Don't be a jerk.

449
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,600
Practice and educate yourself.

450
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,650
So those are ways to improve the quality of your writing.

451
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,460
Once again, I'm going to encourage you to pause and think,

452
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,966
what do you want to try over the next month? And commit

453
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:44,980
to doing it?

454
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,338
If you want to dive deeper into these strategies,

455
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:55,606
get a quick overview. Later this week, share it

456
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:59,106
with a colleague. You can check out a blog post I wrote on the Grammarly

457
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:02,854
for developers. Blog covers the same content, so check

458
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:06,978
that out. Share it with your networks. In closing,

459
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:10,682
use the power of the written word to level up your technical

460
00:29:10,746 --> 00:29:13,900
career. I cannot wait to read what you write.
