1
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,386
You. Hi everyone, thank you again for

2
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:49,406
joining in on my talk about practice,

3
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,410
threat hunting and the impact that it can bring to your organization.

4
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,934
So first of all, I wanted to bring forward this edition.

5
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:01,870
A goal without a plan is just a wish. Of course this can be applied

6
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,522
to anything from your daily life to your

7
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:08,918
work, but it is also true for threatening

8
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:12,522
in particular. The latter is a subject that has

9
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:16,982
become very important if not fundamental for all those organizations

10
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:21,262
that want to invest

11
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:23,710
on a defensive infrastructure.

12
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,146
But in general, in order to exploited the full stratanting

13
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:33,380
these needs to be backed up by an organized and

14
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,674
sound strategy or plan. So first

15
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:41,282
of all, I wanted to represent myself.

16
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:44,706
I'm Fulgio, I'm 25, I have

17
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:48,114
a master's degree in computer science with a deeper dive

18
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:52,134
in cybersecurity. I've been working for the past year and

19
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,734
a half as an analyst and I'm currently head of

20
00:02:55,772 --> 00:02:59,398
the threat hunting project on an international client

21
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:01,500
and I will talk about this later.

22
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,186
So the pyramid that I was hinting before inside

23
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:10,314
of the title slide is the famous

24
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:14,110
or infamous pyramid of pain, developed by David Bianco.

25
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,270
Well scores the amount of pain that

26
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,882
specific indicators or iocs

27
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:25,970
can bring to adversaries and attackers if

28
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,602
the blue team or defensive team has had time and

29
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:33,406
care to protect against them. So we go from the simplest

30
00:03:33,518 --> 00:03:38,130
ashbalus and eps to the more intricate

31
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,550
ttps that are techniques, tactics and procedures.

32
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,482
Of course, these are the ones that need more time and are more

33
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:50,682
complex to take care of,

34
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:54,346
especially on the detection field.

35
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:57,930
However, these are the ones that can bring more value

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,342
and more impact to the organization. And so in this talk

37
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:04,926
we will see, I will explain or at

38
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:08,602
least show why threatening should be more focused

39
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,538
on ttps and hoc. This can be achieved,

40
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:16,354
of course you could say, but why is it worth it? Is it

41
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:20,434
necessary? And since I am italian, I will do a

42
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:24,194
wine metaphor. So we can say that threat funding by itself is a

43
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:28,262
nice bottle of wine, but with just little more

44
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:31,560
we could buy a

45
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,326
better, more tasteful wine that can

46
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:40,422
increase our experience. But of course with a little bit more we can even reach

47
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:44,042
for a charcuterie bore of cheese. And the cheese of course

48
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:48,106
can go well with some orange gem. But overall these

49
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:51,680
are all stuff that do not increase a lot

50
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,142
the amount of money in our metaphor. So the

51
00:04:56,276 --> 00:04:59,534
effort needed to increase and have a

52
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:03,010
better wine experience in this case. But in the

53
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,546
thread in the cybersecurityanalyst field,

54
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:11,330
a greater impact, greater achievements.

55
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,570
So my colleague Nico

56
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,238
that was incapable sadly today of joining us

57
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:23,400
and I have been tackling the problem and

58
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,354
endeavor of threat hunting based on ttps through

59
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:31,260
the project that we have been bringing forward for the past

60
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,274
one year, approximately, that is the Pandora project.

61
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:39,018
The Pandora project starts from three

62
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:43,054
main points. The first one is a single point of failure. So we

63
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:47,290
wanted to avoid basing

64
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,938
our detection solely on one defensive

65
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:55,310
system. So in this case, we took both EDR

66
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,082
and CM of the client as main

67
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:04,210
points, as main defensive systems.

68
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,006
And we applied so redundance. We wanted to

69
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:12,742
focus on the reduction of the dual time, so of the adversary inside

70
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:16,200
of the organization, basing our

71
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,266
activity on assume the

72
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:24,102
breach focus points. So we wanted to be proactive

73
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:28,374
towards attacks, so proactive towards threat hunting, and not just passive.

74
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:31,806
So not only after that the incident happened. And so

75
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:37,198
we wanted to already complement before

76
00:06:37,284 --> 00:06:41,134
time the defensive services and the

77
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:44,450
defensive system already put in place by the client.

78
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,930
So where does this Pandora project present itself and position

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,634
itself. So we have the attackers whose

80
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:58,034
attacks, or at least the majority, are already blocked

81
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:01,654
by these well defined services that

82
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:05,046
are present commercially. So we have

83
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:08,378
EDR, CM, AB and so on.

84
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:12,166
But of course, as we know, especially nowadays,

85
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:16,570
there have been a lot of techniques capable of

86
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,222
circumventing such defensive measure. And so

87
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:23,946
we want to go and block such activities,

88
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:27,566
such possible aviation of

89
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,986
the defenses. And so, as the picture

90
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:34,334
explains, we will be placed between the infrastructure

91
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:36,820
and the already present defensive system.

92
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,470
But what kind of methodologies,

93
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,986
what approach did we use towards threat hunting?

94
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,822
In particular, we decided to shift from

95
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:52,662
a simplistic, we could say model

96
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:56,786
based solely on simple IOC. So the base of the pyramid

97
00:07:56,818 --> 00:08:00,554
of pain, where we find ashes and ips, since they are

98
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:04,902
very brittle, meaning that an attacker can change them very easily

99
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:08,634
and very quickly. And this is done currently to

100
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:11,914
focus on ttps that we said are techniques,

101
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:15,520
tactics and procedures that are more general,

102
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,438
much more complicated and especially

103
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:23,394
are more advantageous, since the attacker needs to

104
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:27,618
change totally the approach to the attack. If we

105
00:08:27,704 --> 00:08:32,242
are able to defend against their

106
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:36,018
kill chain, at least the kill chain that is being observed.

107
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:39,666
And to do so, we applied the methodology developed and explained

108
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:44,306
by Mitre, where the main graphic

109
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:47,862
admission on the right, but that I decided

110
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:51,738
to rewrite in order to demonstrate what we actually did

111
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:55,226
and to better explain it. So we

112
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:58,618
have first of all the first phase where we need

113
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,998
inevitably to analyze and create a

114
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:05,854
threat model, in this case of our client, but in general of what

115
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:10,254
we want to defend. Because first of all, of course, virtually any

116
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,858
kind of attacker can reach any kind of

117
00:09:14,024 --> 00:09:17,650
device of company and whatsoever.

118
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,238
But we know that epts and in general attackers

119
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:25,430
have preferences are

120
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,714
more defined or specific towards sectors

121
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:33,526
or towards specific kind

122
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:38,474
of technologies. So the first important

123
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:42,650
aspect is to understand what actually we want to defend

124
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,574
from. This will help us also understand what kind of ttps

125
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:53,246
actually we want to tackle. Because of course we

126
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:57,390
could tackle them all, but these

127
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,654
will be too much expensive. So we want first

128
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:04,082
to focus on what is actually or has

129
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:07,634
a much more higher probability of reaching us.

130
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:11,266
After this, we take for

131
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:14,950
example the first atp and understand actually

132
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,662
what do we want to detect. So we study

133
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:22,646
it, we create these abstract analytics and

134
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:26,182
then we pass to the next phase that is determined data

135
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:30,026
requirements, where we need to understand if we actually have

136
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:33,530
visibility over this possible attack,

137
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,700
this technique. So in this case,

138
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,594
we need to understand if the data model is full.

139
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:45,054
Otherwise, as the next case suggests, we need

140
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:49,200
to understand what are the gaps and we need to as possible

141
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,400
fill them. So we need to, for example,

142
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,354
enable new event logs. We need for

143
00:10:56,392 --> 00:11:00,466
example to introduce new sensors or for example fix

144
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:04,886
some misconfigurations, because possibly we

145
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:08,550
already have such information, but we

146
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,110
are losing them, so they are not tracked.

147
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,550
And after this, we have one of the most

148
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,490
important phases, that is the development first of all of the rules that

149
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,486
of course can be defined accordingly

150
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:27,980
according to the different languages that

151
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,000
defensive services that are implemented have.

152
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,446
But we also have the phase of the baselining that I

153
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:42,054
will explain better, but that distinguishes

154
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,970
such approach and also such project from the already put

155
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,890
in use solutions.

156
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:53,234
Then we have of course the testing phase where we

157
00:11:53,272 --> 00:11:57,158
take the queries. So the detection analytics that we

158
00:11:57,164 --> 00:12:00,326
have developed or that we want to develop to understand

159
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,054
whether they actually work or not. Because of course theory is

160
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:07,418
something, but practice is another. So in

161
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:11,174
this case, we developed a specific virtual environment

162
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:14,570
in order to replicate specific ttps.

163
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,366
In this way, we both tested the base

164
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:23,902
capabilities of the defensive services, but also

165
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,194
the complementary detection

166
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:30,990
capabilities that we introduce with our rules. And once

167
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,594
we have tested all of this, of course

168
00:12:34,632 --> 00:12:38,286
we deploy the rules themselves and then we start the activity

169
00:12:38,318 --> 00:12:42,194
of hunting. Once, for example, the rule creates an

170
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:45,054
alert. So, as I said,

171
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:48,850
baselining is one of the fundamental

172
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:55,026
aspects of this methodology, of this procedure,

173
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:59,834
of this project. Also, because of

174
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:03,606
course, services like commercially available EDRs

175
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:07,958
and CMs already have put in place some rules

176
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:11,598
that tackle a great quantity of

177
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:14,560
TTPs. However,

178
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,542
of course, voluntarily, they are not

179
00:13:18,596 --> 00:13:22,434
covering all of them. This is because they

180
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:26,130
present themselves as general solution,

181
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,334
not tailored like the one that we are presenting

182
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:33,534
now. Because everything depends

183
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,680
on the infrastructure of the organization itself,

184
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:40,726
because every organization inside has a lot of

185
00:13:40,748 --> 00:13:43,960
events that create a lot of noise that

186
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,078
inevitably either needs to be tuned by the organization itself.

187
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:53,066
So I mean the vendor itself or by the analyst and

188
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:56,330
the blue team of the organization. And this

189
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,974
can of course become very

190
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:04,570
expensive. In this case, we take this tool beforehand,

191
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,946
so we see what are the possible events

192
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:12,102
that can happen that can introduce noise, for example, daily routines

193
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:16,146
introduced by GPO or activities by

194
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:18,500
the operating system by itself.

195
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,590
Or for example, we could have short lasting outliers,

196
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,454
meaning the introduction of new technologies, of a new

197
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:30,102
software, or fixing of

198
00:14:30,156 --> 00:14:34,054
something that introduces a lot of noise that we

199
00:14:34,092 --> 00:14:37,594
need actually to understand where it is coming from, who is

200
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:40,874
doing it, in what is

201
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:44,634
actually required by them. And of course, we have of course the

202
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:48,730
classical noise introduced by admins and it

203
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,814
people in general that can do all sort of

204
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:56,606
activities that can mimic or can

205
00:14:56,708 --> 00:15:00,414
somewhat resemble some specific ttps, even though

206
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:03,714
they are benign. So baselining is

207
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:07,102
a fundamental part, especially in order to avoid

208
00:15:07,246 --> 00:15:10,900
disruption of daily operations due to the

209
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,814
enormous number of potential

210
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:17,974
false positives. In our case, then we have the

211
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:21,126
threat model. That, as I said, is also a very important

212
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:25,014
aspect. In our case, we took many different

213
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,910
sources, for example, reports,

214
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,820
and we didn't just stop

215
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,634
like a couple of them or just one, because in order to

216
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:40,286
have a complete picture, of course we need

217
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:43,486
to understand the different studies that have been brought forward.

218
00:15:43,588 --> 00:15:47,566
Also to reduce the potential bias introduced by a

219
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:51,038
vendor and its report. And the result,

220
00:15:51,204 --> 00:15:54,814
partially visible on the right, is a scale

221
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:58,930
of what are the most used ttps inside of the threat model.

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,642
And so at least an inspiration of what could be the

223
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:05,910
first objectives to tackle.

224
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,360
And then we have the testing environments that we have

225
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,790
developed for such case. So we have produced

226
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,046
three virtual machines. The first one is linked

227
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,474
directly to the EDR. So it is an EDR agent in

228
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:28,122
order to let us see what is the visibility of.

229
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:32,750
For example, some mimicked attacks and techniques

230
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,534
over this machine. For such reason they are called the

231
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:41,390
detonation, since we detonate specific behavior.

232
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,218
And instead we have another machine that is

233
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,090
the CM one, that pretty much does the same exact

234
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,734
thing of the EDR one, but with the CM

235
00:16:52,782 --> 00:16:56,562
agent. And then we have the lock collector that reaches those machines

236
00:16:56,706 --> 00:17:00,242
that are of course put in defensive

237
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:06,450
net so that they do not spread

238
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,726
malicious content all over the organization network,

239
00:17:10,918 --> 00:17:14,938
but that also functions as a log collector for possible

240
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:18,650
analysis postmortem if we want to, for example,

241
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,786
view the event logs. In particular,

242
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:25,966
fundamental is that these machines, the detonation machine, at least

243
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:29,562
mimic exactly the most common environment

244
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:33,198
that is present inside of the organization of your organization.

245
00:17:33,294 --> 00:17:37,410
In this case the

246
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,754
end user device that is one

247
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:44,554
of the most device

248
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:47,910
available to attackers that is most probably going

249
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,734
to be infected eventually down

250
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:55,254
the line. So the

251
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:58,790
deliverables that then can be retrieved

252
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,678
or are received after applying such methodology.

253
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:05,642
And in our case so are many.

254
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:09,506
So we have playbooks in the meaning that once of course you studied

255
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:13,102
TTP and you master it, of course you know

256
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:17,194
also what to check, how to circumvent

257
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:20,202
it, what to actually observe,

258
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,650
so you can create a simple guide for the analyst.

259
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,114
But also, as we said, we have the mitigation of the gaps through for

260
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:30,340
example network changes,

261
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,270
security, new security event logs,

262
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,622
new log sources and

263
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:41,254
of course as previously we have a new testing environment put

264
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:45,014
in place also for other possible activities like simple

265
00:18:45,052 --> 00:18:49,158
detonation of a malware. But we also have threat discoveries.

266
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:52,618
For example, we could see anomalies already present

267
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:56,618
inside of the organization, but of course we are developing them or

268
00:18:56,704 --> 00:19:00,398
these detection analytics also for

269
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:04,346
future possible attacks

270
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:08,126
to the organization. Now I

271
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,422
will present a very simple case just to

272
00:19:11,476 --> 00:19:15,074
show what we actually did in our case.

273
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:18,302
So we took two different techniques

274
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,454
that share a common tool, in this case bitsadmin,

275
00:19:21,502 --> 00:19:25,650
and we are talking about ingress, tool transfer and persistent

276
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,950
through system binding proxy execution. So we started

277
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,306
by understanding what bitsubmin is developing,

278
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:37,722
the abstract analytics. So what do we want

279
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:41,980
to actually detect? What we would like to see

280
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,506
in order to trigger an alert, we have the

281
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:50,442
data dictionary, so what are the sources that can help

282
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:52,240
us understand, for example,

283
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,046
what in an endpoint can trigger us, can alert us. And we

284
00:19:58,068 --> 00:20:01,258
have either the event id for six, eight, eight. So the creation

285
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:04,882
of a new process or the Seismon event id one.

286
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:08,610
However, in our case the organization

287
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,974
did not have or did not deploy

288
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:19,142
Sisman and so we had in this case to work only with

289
00:20:19,196 --> 00:20:22,342
event id, but also in that case we had for example to

290
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:26,374
fix the formatting or the parsing that was

291
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:30,858
present inside of the CM in order for the queries to properly work.

292
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:34,150
And so after such phases,

293
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,494
as we said, we go directly to the creation of the rules,

294
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:41,310
understanding what is the baseline, applying, so whitelisting.

295
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,402
And then we have the testing phase. In testing phase,

296
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:49,290
as we see, we used atomic red, that is a framework

297
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,282
that presents itself perfectly for

298
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,386
such activity, so it can

299
00:20:56,408 --> 00:21:00,354
replicate specific ttps and

300
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:03,634
in our case we reproduce them. And as you can see

301
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:07,526
in the following slide, the test demonstrate that actually

302
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,570
neither EDR or CM were capable of detecting

303
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,790
such subject activities,

304
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,690
but instead with the application of the rules

305
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,850
that we showed previously, but of course translated in the appropriate

306
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:32,350
SQL language, query language were

307
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,790
in fact capable of being detected.

308
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,918
So as we

309
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,482
can see here from this slide, we have actual results.

310
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:46,674
So we have an alert of the EDR on the left, we have

311
00:21:46,712 --> 00:21:50,414
results on the query on the right, the query that will be introduced

312
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:53,282
in the alert itself. And so we can see hoc.

313
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:57,030
This approach actually incremented the visibility,

314
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,446
incremented the efficiency and precision of

315
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:05,078
the detection capabilities of the defensive system, of the

316
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:08,410
organization itself. And so after

317
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,894
such application, after, in this case, this rule,

318
00:22:11,942 --> 00:22:15,290
this scenario, what's next? What can be done?

319
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,034
So, first of all, techniques are not

320
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:23,050
set in stone. As we know, every day new vulnerabilities

321
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,830
are discovered. So for example, it's possible that a

322
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,942
technique that you have tackled has

323
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:34,930
been updated. So you need to retweak what you have already

324
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,820
done in the past and update it in order to be again

325
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,754
efficient. Then after this we

326
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:46,086
can of course go to the next TTP down the line in

327
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:49,638
order to eventually and possibly finish the list that we

328
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:53,014
have produced. And we could

329
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,902
even go directly and tackle apts instead

330
00:22:56,956 --> 00:23:00,620
of ttps, apts meaning adversary and

331
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,930
attackers meaning to tackle specifically their

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,370
kill chain, their way of moving, even though

333
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,114
I don't suggest following such behavior before

334
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:18,154
having at least a mature enough model

335
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:23,140
or defensive infrastructure behind.

336
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,122
So this was all from me for today.

337
00:23:27,176 --> 00:23:30,706
I hope you like the talk, I hope

338
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:34,034
you brought home something. And if you

339
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:37,726
have any kind of question, you can always reach me at the contacts

340
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:40,578
that I'm bringing you.

341
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:44,190
And thanks again and have a nice conference.
