1
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,698
Hello. My name

2
00:01:45,704 --> 00:01:50,050
is Andrey Slastenov, and I am the head of security at Gcore.

3
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,226
One of my primary goal involves protecting our customers

4
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:58,066
from DDoS attacks, and we have extensive experience in

5
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:01,454
this area. Additionally, with a highly distributed

6
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:05,122
infrastructure capable of repealing attacks of more than 100

7
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:08,394
terabytes per second, we have such number of customers

8
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,750
protected within our data centers and worldwide.

9
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,846
We are always up to date with the latest cyber threats

10
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:19,894
trends and gather comprehensive statistics on both existing

11
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:23,470
and zero day threats. As we examine the

12
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,358
landscape of cyber threats, it's crucial to recognize that

13
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:31,262
the escalating scale of the DoS attacks. In the span of

14
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:34,926
just two years, we have witnessed a significant surge

15
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:39,634
in the average attack size. In the beginning of 2021,

16
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:43,198
we saw average attack peaking at 300 gigabit

17
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:46,706
per second. Fast forward to 2022.

18
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:50,342
That number has more than doubled to 650

19
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:54,502
gigabit per second. And by the beginning of 2023,

20
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:57,914
we're facing average attacks of 800 gigabit per

21
00:02:57,952 --> 00:03:01,770
second. This trend is not just a set of

22
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,878
numbers, it's a clear signal that attackers are becoming

23
00:03:05,974 --> 00:03:09,698
more powerful. And as we go into the evolving landscape

24
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:13,722
of cyber threats, IoT becomes evident that the increase

25
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:17,834
in these DOS attack size is closely linked to their increasing

26
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:21,422
of IoT devices. What is

27
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:25,086
interesting that the generation of attacks exceeding

28
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:28,702
one terabit per second has surpassed the capabilities

29
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:32,190
of cluster of servers, or virtual machines

30
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,778
to execute such strong attacks, thousands of widespread

31
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:40,710
devices with high data transfer capabilities are necessary.

32
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,154
IoT and 5G technologies are particular suitable

33
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:48,402
for this purpose, as they offer exactly their

34
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:52,330
characteristics. Why are IoT and

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,310
5G devices frequently used in cyberattacks?

36
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,474
Let's go into that topic. Many of devices,

37
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:03,914
while technologically advanced, have lag

38
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:06,400
in one critical area, security.

39
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,554
They may run on the software that is not regularly

40
00:04:10,602 --> 00:04:13,806
updated or might still use the default passwords

41
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:18,066
that were shipped with. There is vulnerabilities like

42
00:04:18,248 --> 00:04:21,010
open doors for cybercriminals.

43
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,902
Just take a moment and think, when was

44
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:29,250
the last time you updated your home thermostat

45
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,442
connected to the Internet or changed its factory

46
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:37,638
set password? Well, this is not just a personal

47
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:41,510
oversight, it's just a collective secured gap.

48
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,682
These is devices are usually made to be easy to use,

49
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:48,698
but not always secure enough, making them easy target for

50
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:52,046
the hackers. With five g now in the

51
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:56,170
picture, there is security problems can get just much worse.

52
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,254
5g fast speed and the better connection can turn a

53
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:03,738
small security issue into big cybersecurity

54
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,926
problem very quickly. So securing these

55
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:10,980
is devices extends beyond just a regular updated and

56
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,390
strong passwords. We need a complex security strategies

57
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,946
that recognize and effectively counters the risk of

58
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:22,566
IoT and 5G technologies. Want to

59
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,974
know how the big problem is? Look at the

60
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:29,594
picture on my slide. So I get this information from

61
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:33,962
very popular showdown site which showing by

62
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:37,994
some filtering rules which I put

63
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:41,566
there like you

64
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:44,670
can see that I just searched for the microtech with open

65
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,170
port 80 and you can see how many devices

66
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,026
is there open for the access

67
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:55,810
through the Internet. So this is a huge

68
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,530
problem of such kind of devices.

69
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,134
Let's explore the structure of their attacks.

70
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:06,550
Typically they involve key

71
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,486
elements. These attackers a command and control center

72
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:14,710
and network of bots known as the botnet.

73
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,394
Looking at the mechanics of DDoS attack in the

74
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:22,518
context of IoT drive and botnets, we can identify these several

75
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:25,914
steps. The first step involves the

76
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,482
attacker selecting their target. This target could be

77
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:33,518
a specific device, a website or an online service.

78
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,314
These choice of target is often strategic,

79
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:39,962
aiming to cause maximum disruption or damage.

80
00:06:40,106 --> 00:06:43,762
For instance, targeting a financial service website could

81
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:47,778
have a far reach implications affecting the numbers,

82
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:51,314
users and transactions. The next

83
00:06:51,352 --> 00:06:54,914
step is orchestrated by the command

84
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:58,438
and control center. This center act as the

85
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:02,166
orchestrator for the entire botnet. It sends out the

86
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:06,310
attacker instructions to all of the compromised IoT devices.

87
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,242
These instructions are to start sending requests,

88
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:14,774
typically in overhauling manner to chosen

89
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:18,426
target. The command and control center does

90
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:22,174
not just initiate the attacks, it also coordinates the behavior of

91
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:25,594
entire botnet, ensuring that the attack is sustained

92
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:29,486
and effective. The final step is

93
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:33,534
the actual execution of the DDoS attack. All the bots in the network

94
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:37,618
now acting under the instructions from the comment and control

95
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:41,134
center, start sending large volume

96
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:44,606
of the request to the target. This volume

97
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:48,482
of traffic is intended to overhand the target resources.

98
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:52,326
For website, this could mean making it inaccessible to

99
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:56,594
legitimate users, essentially taking it offline

100
00:07:56,722 --> 00:08:00,298
for device or server. This could lead to system

101
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:04,090
crashes or several disruption in

102
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,530
traffic functionality or the surface.

103
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,834
As we go deeper into the complex structure of IoT drive

104
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:15,310
and botnets, it's crucial to understand that their

105
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,034
threats extend beyond the just launching DDoS attacks.

106
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:23,166
Botnets represents a complex and layer of danger, not only because

107
00:08:23,268 --> 00:08:26,818
they can disturb the services through DDoS, but also

108
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:30,850
due to their ability to continuously

109
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,922
and recruit other IoT devices. This self propagating

110
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:40,370
nature of botnets makes them especially threat.

111
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,034
As such, compromised devices becomes a tool for further

112
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,738
expanding the network. Let's talk how

113
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:51,862
botnet infect another devices. Botnet periodically

114
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:55,318
scan the Internet for vulnerability. IoT devices

115
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:59,254
these could be anything from home security cameras

116
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:03,166
to smart thermostats. Many of their devices have

117
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:07,002
default or weak passwords, making them easy target

118
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:10,686
the betnot net use automated tools to scan the

119
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:14,110
vast ranges of IP addresses,

120
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,286
looking for the devices that respond and show signs

121
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:22,402
of the vulnerability. Once a vulnerability device is

122
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:26,166
identified, the attacker exploits these vulnerabilities to gain the

123
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:29,926
control. This often involves injecting malware into the

124
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:33,414
devices. The malware is typically sent from

125
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:37,250
load these servers, which stores the malicious gcore.

126
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,986
The code is designed to give

127
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:44,842
the attacker remote control over the device, and can

128
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:48,250
often evade basic security measures.

129
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,606
After device is compromised, it becomes part of

130
00:09:52,628 --> 00:09:56,702
the attacker's botnet. It now responds to the commands from

131
00:09:56,756 --> 00:10:01,306
the command and control center. Just like other infected devices.

132
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:05,106
The newly recruited bot is ready to participate in the

133
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:09,154
DOS attack or any other malicious activity dictated by

134
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,818
their botnet apparatus. And also

135
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:16,950
the infected device may report back to the command and control

136
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,422
center. It may relay information about its

137
00:10:20,476 --> 00:10:24,214
capabilities, location, or even find

138
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:28,534
a report about these vulnerable

139
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:32,140
devices in the same network. This information

140
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,374
is used to further expand the botnets or to optimize

141
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:40,522
the attack strategy. The process of infecting IoT

142
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:44,382
devices and incorporating them into the botnets is pretty

143
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:48,650
straightforward for the attackers. This underscores the critical importance

144
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,070
of securing the IoT devices.

145
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,534
Well, in the first half of 2023 alone,

146
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:59,298
we have witnessed a huge over 300%

147
00:10:59,384 --> 00:11:03,902
increase in IoT driving these DDoS attacks. This unprecedented

148
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:07,986
rise is not just a number, it represents a significant and growing

149
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:11,266
threat to our digital infrastructure.

150
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,810
It's important to note that 90% of their sophisticated

151
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,894
attacks are based on the botnet. There is multivector attacks

152
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:23,190
combine different types of attacks patterns

153
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,020
and this make them harder to defense against.

154
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,190
These DDoS attacks has far reaching and often devastating consequences

155
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,470
for businesses and organizations.

156
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,670
It can be like direct financial losses.

157
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,526
So the financial implication of the DoS

158
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:48,590
attacks is easy to measure.

159
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,778
For instance, online store in 50,000

160
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:57,794
euro per hour will get the same amount of losses

161
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,186
for every hour of downtime caused by the DoS

162
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:04,598
attack. Another potential threat is the

163
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,946
loss of the customers. In industries where

164
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:11,226
the competition is huge,

165
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:17,510
downtime can drive customers to competitors compensation

166
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,754
expenses. Particularly for service based businesses

167
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:25,722
like SaaS, there is often expectation

168
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,670
to compensate these clients for the downtime.

169
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,406
So it's also oding to the financial strain

170
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:35,140
caused by the DDoS attack itself.

171
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,390
And the final one, the loss of customer loyalty.

172
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,914
So the Internet provides a powerful platform for customers to

173
00:12:42,952 --> 00:12:46,466
voice their dissatisfaction. So negative

174
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:50,166
reviews can deter their potential customers, leading to a

175
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:54,310
loss of business and customer loyalty.

176
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,466
So in the light of the increasing threats posed by

177
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:03,210
IoT driving the DOS attacks, it's imperative that we

178
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,742
discuss the best practice for safeguarding our devices

179
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:10,202
and the networks. Effective protection

180
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:14,414
measures are not just an option, they are necessity in

181
00:13:14,452 --> 00:13:17,150
this rapidly evolving digital landscape.

182
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,562
From IoT devices side the first and fundamental

183
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:25,506
step is to change their default password on

184
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:29,758
all IoT devices. Default passwords are often easily

185
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,842
guessable and are common entry for

186
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,906
point for attackers. By setting strong unique

187
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:41,250
passwords, you significantly reduce the risk of your devices

188
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,710
being compromised.

189
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:48,074
Also, you should regularly updating the firmware of

190
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:51,834
your IoT devices to fix the

191
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,770
critical vulnerabilities.

192
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,358
Manufacturers often release firmware updates

193
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:01,774
to patch the vulnerabilities. By keeping your

194
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:05,518
devices up to date, you always ensure that

195
00:14:05,684 --> 00:14:09,470
any known security flows are addressed promptly.

196
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,850
Another point is implementing strong notification mechanism.

197
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,918
This scope may include two factor notification

198
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:23,726
or digital certificates. Strong notification

199
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:27,334
ensure that only authorized users can access and

200
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:31,110
control your IoT devices and the final

201
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,642
one is exploring and considering IoT

202
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:38,750
security frameworks. So these is frameworks provides

203
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,710
the guidelines and best practices for securing IoT

204
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,250
ecosystems.

205
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,142
Adhering to their frameworks can help

206
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:53,374
in systematically securing devices and

207
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,890
the data they handle from the network

208
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,162
site. It's crucial to protect against IoT driving

209
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:04,814
botnet attacks with specialized DDoS protection

210
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,606
solution usually this solution is not on premise,

211
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:12,126
it's cloud based. So there is solution

212
00:15:12,238 --> 00:15:15,874
designed to detect and mitigate the DOS attacks, providing an additional

213
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:19,606
layer of defenses. They are especially

214
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:24,022
important for organizations which

215
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:28,154
is heavily rely on line services and so

216
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:31,690
they are at higher risk of being targeted.

217
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,322
And usually the cloud based

218
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:38,826
DDoS protection systems can provide a huge

219
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:42,782
amount of capacity so

220
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:46,254
they can sustain the attacks which is going over one

221
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:50,094
terabit or even thousand of terabit per

222
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:54,002
second. And let's now

223
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:57,922
look at the real world example to better the

224
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:02,302
dynamic of IoT botnets attacks and how it was successfully

225
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:05,778
mitigated this case studies from

226
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:10,630
Gcore provides developable insight into the nature of these

227
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,710
attacks and importance of the robust response strategy.

228
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,382
The client faced a DDoS attack that was highly distributed

229
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:23,002
involving numerous of devices. The attack method used

230
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:27,334
was known as the carpet bombing which utilized UDP

231
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:30,734
traffic to overhelm the target. This type

232
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:34,542
of attack is particularly challenging because it

233
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:38,414
spreads across multiply client addresses, making it

234
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:41,790
harder to isolate and defense against

235
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,650
such kind of attack. This not only made it difficult

236
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,406
to detect the attack, but also led to the overloading

237
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,766
of uplinks, that is their cumulative traffic.

238
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,366
The big volume and distributed nature of the attack posed

239
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:59,270
a significant threat to the client network.

240
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,526
Well, the key to our success

241
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:07,190
was identifying the common pattern in the attack.

242
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,186
So usually the botnet used

243
00:17:11,228 --> 00:17:14,874
the pretty similar devices and pretty

244
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,780
common the attack patterns which can be

245
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,726
easily identified. Like for example, you have 1000 of

246
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:26,878
devices which is doing the same

247
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:30,570
thing and using the same approach for the attacks.

248
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,986
So the

249
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:38,114
good analytics system can help you to

250
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:41,730
identify that pattern and block such kind of attacks.

251
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,278
The post investigated investigation that we did

252
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:50,114
revealed that the attacker used the botnet exploit

253
00:17:50,162 --> 00:17:53,302
in the health check kiosk. These kiosks were

254
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:56,502
used to construct the botnets network, demonstrating how

255
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:59,350
everyday devices can be weapons.

256
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,846
So as you see on that pictures, our analytics

257
00:18:03,878 --> 00:18:08,042
system easily detect inside the packet that red

258
00:18:08,096 --> 00:18:11,934
highlighted pattern which was used to block the

259
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:15,390
whole attack. The size of attack

260
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,160
was almost one terabit per second.

261
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,282
So in the previous slide, we examined a real

262
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,450
world case study of IoT botnet attack.

263
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,146
Now let's discuss the key elements that enable us to

264
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:32,930
sustain and mitigate such attacks effectively.

265
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,570
Understanding their tools and strategy is crucial for any organization

266
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,590
looking to improve the cybersecurity defense, or who just

267
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,542
want to use these

268
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:48,714
third party vendors to provide them

269
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,186
the DDoS protection services. So the first line of

270
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:56,438
defense against widespread IoT botnet attacks is their distributed

271
00:18:56,534 --> 00:19:00,090
architecture and distributed infrastructure,

272
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,370
seamlessly integrated, in our case, in our CDN

273
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,280
content delivery network. This setup allow

274
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,486
us for the distribution of the network load,

275
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:17,282
preventing any single point of failure in the face of the

276
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:18,740
huge DDoS attack.

277
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,062
This distributed nature helps to absorb and dispense

278
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:28,322
their massive

279
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:32,674
amount of the traffic, thereby safeguarding the core

280
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:37,262
services and assets. The role of sophisticated

281
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:40,922
analytics cannot be overstated. In today's digital age,

282
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:44,966
there is attack patterns are complex and constantly evolving.

283
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:49,602
Traditional static defense mechanisms are no longer sufficient.

284
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:53,280
These is systems provide agility and

285
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,082
intelligence necessary to identify, analyze,

286
00:19:57,146 --> 00:20:00,926
respond to threat in real time. These is

287
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:04,370
system learn from each attack and provide the necessary data

288
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,338
for the next element. And the next element is

289
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:12,126
deep packet inspection plays a pivotal role

290
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:14,260
in our auditos protection system.

291
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,602
Deep packet inspection goes beyond IP address filtering.

292
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,426
It examines their data within the network packets.

293
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:27,394
Attack can be blocked not only by IP and protocol

294
00:20:27,442 --> 00:20:31,160
headers, but by the content of the packet itself.

295
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,046
So as the conclusion, first let's acknowledge

296
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:38,742
the paradox of progress. While five G and IoT technologies

297
00:20:38,806 --> 00:20:42,282
bring unmatched connectivity and convenience,

298
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:46,346
they simultaneously escalate the threat of landscape,

299
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:49,866
particularly in terms of sophisticated these DOS attacks.

300
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:53,662
These dual nature demands our attention

301
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:57,374
and action. The enhanced speed and connectivity

302
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,054
offered by 5G are not just a bonus for our digital

303
00:21:01,102 --> 00:21:05,250
lives. They also amplify the potential severity of the cyberattack.

304
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,574
They vary features that make

305
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:13,282
5G revolutionary also make it potential

306
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:16,566
for malicious activities. When it

307
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:21,078
comes to IoT we face a vulnerability crisis.

308
00:21:21,174 --> 00:21:24,646
Many of their devices are not fortified with robust

309
00:21:24,678 --> 00:21:28,202
security measures, making them attractive and easy

310
00:21:28,256 --> 00:21:31,662
target for cybercriminals. So these

311
00:21:31,796 --> 00:21:36,074
vulnerabilities is not just a risk, it's just a gaping hole

312
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:37,790
in our digital defense.

313
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,386
Well, addressing these risk is not just a

314
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:46,850
task for tech experts. It secured a collective.

315
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,010
So we need the widespread awareness about their threats and

316
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,740
the implementation of standard security protocols across all

317
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,834
IoT and 5G devices. It's a shared

318
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:03,302
responsibility to fortify our

319
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:07,080
digital system, not only from,

320
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,442
let's say, the organizational side,

321
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:14,566
but from the user side as well. And lastly,

322
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:18,634
I want to recognize these value of the specialized high

323
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,526
capacity DDoS protection systems, because usually

324
00:22:22,628 --> 00:22:26,622
you cannot avoid or

325
00:22:26,676 --> 00:22:30,510
fully mitigate IoT based DDoS attack

326
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,306
because the high volume of the traffic. So there is services

327
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:38,180
equipped to handle the scale and

328
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,270
complexity of the attack in the IoT environments.

329
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,834
So they provide an essential layer of the defense and

330
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:50,798
can sustain more than several terabytes

331
00:22:50,894 --> 00:22:53,970
of attack. I think that's all for today.

332
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,010
Thank you for your attention, and I'm ready to answer

333
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,440
any of your questions. Thank you.
