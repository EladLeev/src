1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:41,506
Safe

2
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:45,206
for joining me for this session on what the cloud threat landscape looks

3
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:48,566
like in 2021. My name is Trickram and I am

4
00:00:48,588 --> 00:00:52,446
a cloud security architect or checkpoint, and I work with customers

5
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:55,306
and some of our business partners in the UK and Ireland,

6
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:59,294
mostly discussing our cloud security technology and how

7
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:02,846
that helps to address our customers'needs and requirements when it

8
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:06,378
comes to cloud deployments. Now, I promise I'm not going to talk about any technology

9
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:09,390
or pitch any of our solutions in this session.

10
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,850
It's more general talk about the types of interactions I have with customers

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,882
and the sort of concerns that real customers are seeing that can be quite different

12
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:20,114
to what we see from the different analysts

13
00:01:20,162 --> 00:01:23,206
and some of the bigger headline threats that people talk about when

14
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:26,454
it comes to cloud security. So I'm going to be running through a very

15
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:30,594
quick summary of what the cloud threat landscape looks like

16
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:33,610
to us and to our customers, what they're concerned about,

17
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,906
but more importantly, what the different types of customer conversations I

18
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:40,650
have are, and what the different sort of customers expect

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,610
from their type of usage in the public cloud.

20
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,106
So a little bit about checkpoint, and again, this is not a pitch. I promise

21
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:49,966
I'm not going to be talking about our solutions or anything. Checkpoint were one

22
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:53,566
of the first vendors to market with a commercial firewall offering back in

23
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:57,378
1993, and we've been going since then. We've come up with

24
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:00,990
a lot of new technology to address different needs. We've had ips,

25
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,578
antivirus, endpoint and other solutions, and now, and this

26
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,826
is where I work, I work in the cloud area of the

27
00:02:07,848 --> 00:02:11,606
business. I should say that cloud isn't a particularly new technology for

28
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:14,566
us. We've been with cloud pretty much from the start. It's been running for about

29
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:17,846
eight years or so now with checkpoint as a vendor. So what are

30
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:22,010
the biggest threats? And unfortunately, I'll start with a vague answer, which is,

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,946
it depends. It varies very much depending on the type,

32
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:30,198
the size and the maturity of the customer that we're talking to. Different businesses

33
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:33,466
have very different priorities, and I can't emphasize the

34
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:37,086
very, quite enough here. Some customers are very new to

35
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,538
public cloud, some of them are very experienced, and we've

36
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:43,262
got a lot of customers that fall in the middle as well. So for some,

37
00:02:43,316 --> 00:02:46,546
cloud might be, hey look, I've got an ECT running in AWS, I'm a big

38
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:50,718
cloud customer. For others, it's huge deployment, multiple platforms,

39
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:53,934
multiple different asset types, compute, database,

40
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:57,106
machine learning, pretty much everything the cloud can offer. They will have an

41
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:00,406
element of that in their deployment. So it is very broad and

42
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:04,214
we speak to very different types of customers, and so much so that one day

43
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:07,766
I'll be talking to one at the entry level public cloud,

44
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:11,474
the next day it might be a cloud expert, and I'm really on my toes

45
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:14,614
trying to keep up with them, more or less. Everyone faces the same risks,

46
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,866
though. So in public cloud, in a data center,

47
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:21,114
with a server that sits on a desk in an office, people are

48
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:24,774
exposed to the same types of threats, and it's

49
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:28,318
just maybe in a different order. So again, depending on your maturity in

50
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:31,294
the public cloud and where you are with your level of service adoption in public

51
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:34,926
cloud, you're just going to face different things slightly differently, and maybe to

52
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,658
a more or less a degree as well. So I'm going to

53
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:42,734
stereotype some of the customers that I speak to on a daily basis

54
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:46,466
to give you an idea of what sort of interactions I have and

55
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:50,626
how the different types of threats that the analysts talk about affect

56
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:54,434
the customers that we speak to. And I say real businesses or typical

57
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:58,406
businesses. These are the requests that I get from some of my customers, some of

58
00:03:58,428 --> 00:04:02,054
the partners that I work with, and hopefully it'll give you an idea of how

59
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:05,386
different they are and where they sit on that maturity scale and as such,

60
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:08,822
where their priorities lie when it comes to addressing these types of threats.

61
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:12,186
So, customer number one, this is what we would call a

62
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:15,774
more traditional customer that's got some servers and a data center,

63
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:19,566
and they don't have a lot of exposure to cloud. So it

64
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:23,454
might be the business they work for, or it could be a public services

65
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:27,022
organization. And traditionally speaking, they don't have any

66
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:30,274
care or desire to move to cloud. But someone somewhere has said,

67
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:32,626
we've had a mandate given to us where we are now going to move to

68
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:36,194
cloud, and you have to start moving into cloud.

69
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:39,902
They don't have the education, they don't know what they want to do in cloud,

70
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:42,742
but they've been told, go off and do cloud. So they'll do just that.

71
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:46,086
They'll go to AWS is your GCP, and they'll start

72
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:49,766
looking at services and think, oh, compute, I've got a web server that might be

73
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,174
useful. Databases. Yeah, I've heard of that. We've got one of those in a rack

74
00:04:53,222 --> 00:04:56,554
somewhere gathering dust. Let's go with this. So they

75
00:04:56,592 --> 00:05:00,026
will almost be forced into public cloud adoption, and it

76
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:02,826
might not be something they want to put a lot of effort into. It might

77
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:06,686
not be something they've got a lot of skill and expertise or even budget to

78
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,758
put that level of effort into. So they will go into it,

79
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:13,102
reluctant from the outset. And this type of customer,

80
00:05:13,236 --> 00:05:16,386
they will typically face very different problems

81
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:20,114
than someone who is experienced or willing to move into public cloud.

82
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:24,034
They will see a lot of misconfiguration type problems. I'll cover

83
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:27,550
some of the highlight headline problems toward the end of the slides,

84
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,682
but this is one type of customer scenario that we see fairly regularly.

85
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:35,702
Then you've got the second customer who has some sort of demand or

86
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:38,946
requirement to be in public cloud, be it a technical demand

87
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:43,030
or a commercial demand. They want to reduce cost potentially, or be more cost effective.

88
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,266
The usual type of arguments for why businesses want to move to cloud, and you

89
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:50,266
look at the first or second slide and a typical pitch and

90
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:53,178
cloud is more cost effective. It can be, I wouldn't say cheaper. That's a bit

91
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:56,366
of a misconception, but anyway, not going to talk about that. They have a

92
00:05:56,388 --> 00:06:00,414
need and a driver that's pushing them into public cloud, and something about

93
00:06:00,452 --> 00:06:04,062
it fixes a particular problem they've got. The reason I've got here,

94
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:07,162
the square peg round hole stock photo,

95
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:10,830
is a lot of people see cloud as the fix all solution.

96
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,074
They take what they're doing now and they think if I do it in cloud,

97
00:06:13,112 --> 00:06:17,134
it's going to make everything better. They don't necessarily know why, but they've

98
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:20,534
heard lots of success stories about going to cloud. So they take what they're doing

99
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:24,802
or what they have been doing in the data center, in an office hosted

100
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,210
solution, wherever it might be. A non cloud scenario,

101
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,518
they'll take exactly that and they will dump it into cloud, the lift and shift

102
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:35,050
scenario, if you will. So for these customers, they are going to typically see problems

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,314
around functionality in the architecture not working

104
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:41,826
in the same way that they wanted. So again, probably misconfiguration,

105
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,422
but taking non cloud workloads and putting them into cloud

106
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:49,006
can lead to other problems, like scale, or maybe some

107
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:52,282
of the security mechanisms that they've got in a traditional

108
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:56,122
environment aren't present in cloud, and they've looked over them and maybe thought,

109
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:59,758
yeah, we'll fix that later, let's get it working now, and then we'll worry

110
00:06:59,774 --> 00:07:03,474
about security later. Something else that comes up quite frequently for me,

111
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:07,426
then we've got the far end of the scale. We've got customers

112
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:11,606
who have only ever used public cloud and only ever want to use public cloud.

113
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:14,966
For them, data centers are not a thing, and they've missed out on the experience

114
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,582
of being in a data center, racking up servers, plugging cables in

115
00:07:18,636 --> 00:07:22,086
power, networking, worrying about airflow, making sure the server is

116
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,466
cooled, and all the fun things that you have when you have to ferret around

117
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,506
in the data center for hours on end, you can tell I'm a little bit

118
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:32,266
jaded about that. But anyway, let's not get bogged down with that. These types of

119
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:35,610
customers have very different demands, and it's all about the native tools.

120
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,162
It's all about agility, elasticity, and ultimately speed.

121
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:42,766
Not just speed of the service and how quickly a user can access it,

122
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,378
but how quickly they can get the next change pushed out to production. So the

123
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:49,934
points I've got here, if it's not using native tools, if you're kind of shoehorning

124
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:54,190
something in, they don't typically care about that. If I've got a logger request

125
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,874
or a firewall rule modification or some other, what they

126
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:01,426
see is archaic control to get an update

127
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:05,110
actioned in public cloud, that's a blocker for them. That's not something

128
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,142
that lends itself to the overall experience of being in cloud, which does work

129
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,586
well with speed and agility and the ability to get

130
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:16,406
to value more quickly. And there are less barriers there to that app

131
00:08:16,438 --> 00:08:20,314
as well. This is something that we come across a lot. People are increasingly more

132
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:24,298
interested in consuming APIs to automate deployment into cloud.

133
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:27,614
So to summarize that, the first type of customer that we have

134
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:30,794
is, I don't want to generalize too much and say that they're slow,

135
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:34,026
but they are more used to a slow moving environment.

136
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,346
Somewhere in the middle, you've got people who are wanting to move to cloud and

137
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:40,546
want to take advantage of these things, but are held back by something.

138
00:08:40,648 --> 00:08:44,642
So they'll do the best they can and they will cut

139
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:48,686
corners and kind of crowbar things into public cloud where it doesn't

140
00:08:48,718 --> 00:08:52,118
necessarily fit there entirely. Then you've got the ones who understand cloud. They know what

141
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:55,430
they're doing, and they just want to go fast, get everything deployed, and make changes

142
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,222
rapidly, regularly, and deliver the next feature or the next update or the next thing.

143
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:02,326
And they want to do that without being held back by,

144
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:06,106
dare I say, security. Something to bear in mind, and this is something I have

145
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,386
to remind myself of quite regularly, is that cloud is a lot of things to

146
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,050
a lot of people, and to some people it is still nothing. So within

147
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,366
checkpoint, as an organization, we've got the team that I work in, which is the

148
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:19,646
cloud team, where we predominantly speak to cloud customers. But there are

149
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:23,386
still a large number of people out there who don't know cloud. They're not experienced

150
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:26,718
with cloud. And while a lot of people watching this session are probably thinking

151
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:29,998
this seems quite basic, and I know what cloud is for. I know what I

152
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,926
should be doing in cloud. There might be people out there who are new to

153
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:36,358
cloud, same way that there are the types of customers we speak to. They have

154
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:39,910
very little idea about what to do in cloud. They think that it's where

155
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,414
technology is going and they want to move what they've got from data center into

156
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:47,030
cloud, but they have no way to kind of get up to speed very quickly.

157
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,906
So for them, that is a risk in itself. Moving to cloud, moving to an

158
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:54,378
unknown environment, and being faced with all of these services,

159
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:58,250
all of the controls and all of the ways of setting up these services,

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,180
that is scary and a risk in itself.

161
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,018
So this quite nicely summarizes the type of journey

162
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:08,494
that we see when customers are starting out with cloud or very

163
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:12,266
experienced with cloud. You've got the data center on the left, and then you've

164
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:15,854
got the more cloud focused technologies on the right hand side.

165
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:20,002
So with serverless lambda functions, azure functions, whatever your platform of choice is,

166
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:23,426
you've got serverless in some form or another. Then you've got the

167
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,594
different points in the middle. So starting off on the left, one of the first

168
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:30,302
barriers and threats when it comes to cloud is

169
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:33,814
the speed of changes. The first type of customer that I spoke about would

170
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:37,334
maybe see one or two change requests a week to open up a port or

171
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:41,020
to provision a new server, deploy an application onto it.

172
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,986
When you're in cloud, one or two times a week just isn't something

173
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:48,938
that most customers will encounter. There will be dozens of changes

174
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:52,806
daily, if not hundreds a day. If you look at the extreme example of Amazon,

175
00:10:52,838 --> 00:10:56,906
they have a vast number of changes per day, which would just make a traditional

176
00:10:57,018 --> 00:11:00,398
legacy network admin cry and hide in a corner of a

177
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:04,398
data center. Then you've got the shift in focus of who's in control in

178
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:07,514
these environments. So typically you had the system admin,

179
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:10,898
the firewall guy, the network guy, the security guys, they were all the kings in

180
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,146
their domains. Now that we've moved to cloud or are moving to

181
00:11:14,168 --> 00:11:17,118
cloud, depending on where you are in that sort of customer scale,

182
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:20,454
the developer, the engineer, they're the ones in control, they're the ones

183
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:24,486
that are using this service and pushing this technology out to

184
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:28,514
its new home, which is the cloud you don't have the natural

185
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:31,640
flow of information and infrastructure from.

186
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,874
Here is something I've built on my laptop. I'm going to put it on a

187
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:38,106
USB drive or an FTP server, then send an email to the

188
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:41,694
admin team and say, please make this live, please check it for security, please check

189
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,926
it for network visibility, et cetera. They do

190
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:49,386
everything. They write the application, they write the code, they are responsible for deployment

191
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:53,034
and hopefully they've considered security when it gets into production.

192
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:56,526
So what ports are open? How am I going to scan the dependencies, the modules,

193
00:11:56,558 --> 00:12:00,098
the packages that I use? All of this is basically down to

194
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:04,098
one role, which is the developer. So admittedly, depending on the

195
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,938
size of the team, the size of the business, there will be lots of developers

196
00:12:06,974 --> 00:12:10,514
with a slightly different focus. But that's probably a topic

197
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:14,322
for another session in itself. Generally speaking, in the larger scale

198
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:17,686
of things, when you're looking at customers who aren't in

199
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,406
the cloud, to customers who are very mature in the cloud, the developer

200
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,586
is the new person who is responsible overall for these

201
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:28,026
types of things. Now moving on to the next step, each of

202
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,830
the newer types of services in cloud. So whether you're using containers

203
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,786
or one of the microservices based architectures, sort of beyond

204
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,986
containers, kubernetes, for example, you are then faced

205
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:42,190
with a vast number of perimeters that you now have to secure. So again,

206
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,934
going back to the traditional days, the traditional teams, you have a very

207
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:49,614
well defined perimeter and that's your data center. Beyond that you've got your firewall

208
00:12:49,662 --> 00:12:52,786
and that is the ingress and egress point for all of the traffic and all

209
00:12:52,808 --> 00:12:56,222
of the consumption of your application and all of the data that leads.

210
00:12:56,286 --> 00:13:00,126
Now if you're using something like serverless and you say to the network

211
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:03,446
guy or the firewall guy, where does the firewall go? Well, it doesn't, it has

212
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:06,038
no place in serverless. You've got to look at other technologies to be able to

213
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:09,574
secure that. So the traditional points of control have

214
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:12,906
gone, they're not gone completely. There are now new points of

215
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:16,442
control that you have to consider, but this is very far removed from

216
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:20,250
what teams are traditionally used to. So again, that is another

217
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,358
threat to any workload that's running in the cloud.

218
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:27,226
If you think you're protected by your traditional tools, your firewall,

219
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:30,394
for example, your endpoint solution, your insert

220
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,966
other security vendor type here that might not be relevant or

221
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:36,830
even possible to deploy in a cloud scenario.

222
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,770
So that's another consideration. And then there's code as well. So we've said already

223
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,194
that the developer is the new king in this realm and

224
00:13:44,232 --> 00:13:47,806
they're the ones who have a vast amount of control over the deployments,

225
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:51,462
the level of security associated with that deployment as well.

226
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:54,918
Now there are some excellent developers out there who have got a lot

227
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:59,154
of security focus and they know about secure coding and secure software development,

228
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:03,414
lifecycle management. There are some people who have no idea why input validation

229
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:06,602
is important and they just won't do it. So one small

230
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:09,962
example, but generally speaking, a lot of what happens in cloud

231
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,106
and cloud architectures and cloud deployments is purely code based now. So you

232
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:17,834
don't have the team that builds the server for you, that puts the security software

233
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:21,662
on it, that patches it, that maintains it. Again, it's down to one

234
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:25,406
person or maybe a handful of people that write the application and then stick it

235
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:29,042
out in production. Not saying that's the case in every scenario by any means.

236
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:32,882
There are some very thorough approaches to security when it comes to cloud

237
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:36,374
deployments. But generally speaking, this is something which is quite

238
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:40,146
lacking and leaving everything up to the development

239
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:43,702
teams who have a very focused level of experience

240
00:14:43,836 --> 00:14:47,526
on development and producing code. They don't necessarily know

241
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:50,754
about all of the risks that you face at the network level, at the perimeter

242
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:54,426
level, at the host level, at the operating system. There's a lot to consider and

243
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:57,114
they have a hard enough time thinking about how to make the application work,

244
00:14:57,152 --> 00:15:00,358
let alone securing it with many tools

245
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:04,078
and many different techniques. So all of that said, hopefully setting the

246
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:07,486
context a little bit with our take on what the

247
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,862
threats are to use and adoption of public

248
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,542
cloud for businesses. Again, businesses being a quite varied term in itself.

249
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:18,306
Small business, large business, will approach it differently and face different problems. But the

250
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:22,610
biggest one that I think most people would agree with is misconfiguration.

251
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,930
It's probably the biggest one because it covers so much, and it's a very

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,486
vague and broad term, and I would be here for hours to

253
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:33,798
talk about all of the different types of misconfigurations that I've come across and I

254
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:37,334
talk about with customers. But generally speaking, there are some more

255
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:40,874
commonly misconfigured assets that I see when talking to people.

256
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:44,698
These focus mostly on storage. So s three,

257
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:48,534
storage accounts in azure networks and databases,

258
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:52,166
the most common things that people couple with the different types of workloads

259
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,026
and public clouds. S three is something which gets used and possibly misused

260
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:59,518
a lot, not just by users and engineers and architects in

261
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:03,338
the cloud, but also by the media. When it comes to saying cloud is insecure,

262
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:07,010
there's this s three bucket that's been leaking files. It's caused this many problems

263
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,842
across so many organizations. Yes, it has.

264
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:13,426
Personally, I think it's a little bit unfair because there was a

265
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:17,102
problem back in the day when you deploy s three that it wasn't secure

266
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:21,058
by default. Now security is the default option, and users

267
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:24,214
have to tick a number of boxes to say, yes, I know what I'm doing.

268
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:27,654
I want to make it insecure. I want to make it accessible to everyone

269
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:31,398
on the Internet. But then users tend to favor functionality over jumping

270
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:34,682
through hoops to get access to something. So that's a problem in itself,

271
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:38,102
and that falls under misconfiguration. So Gartner

272
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,882
have said a number of times that most of the failures in public cloud

273
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:44,774
are going to be down to the users. And it was, I think, last year,

274
00:16:44,832 --> 00:16:48,330
about 95% of cloud security problems being the user's fault.

275
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,934
They've increased that. Now, through 2025, up to 99%

276
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:55,266
of cloud security failures will be on the user, which I can completely see.

277
00:16:55,368 --> 00:16:58,734
Cloud contains a number of brilliant services and tools

278
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:02,338
to secure those services, but they're quite complex. And as such,

279
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:05,986
I can see, and we do see customers misconfiguring a lot of

280
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:09,106
things a lot of the time. Then we've got

281
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,530
IAM an authorization. This is a really difficult error,

282
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,958
and one which we're often asked by customers, do you have

283
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:19,398
a magic thing to fix it and not here to pitch at all?

284
00:17:19,484 --> 00:17:22,774
It's not something which we have. A magical solution

285
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:26,154
to controlling what your users do and what they have

286
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:29,594
access to and what they should have access to is a time consuming and

287
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:33,306
difficult task. We've seen some customers with

288
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:37,294
some very unique approaches to it. We've seen some customers with

289
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:40,462
no approach to it, and they will go for the, let's just leave it open.

290
00:17:40,516 --> 00:17:43,854
Nothing bad will happen, I'm sure, and we'll secure it later on. That is not

291
00:17:43,892 --> 00:17:47,114
something I would advocate by any stretch. It's a terrible idea,

292
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:50,446
although it's complicated. You at least have to get the basics down. If you don't,

293
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:54,638
you're in for a fairly horrible experience. I could almost guarantee that I've

294
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:58,114
got here that it played an important role in a recent incident. It played a

295
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:01,506
very unfortunate role in a number of instances recently where an attacker

296
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,126
has got in through maybe a security vulnerability in something

297
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:08,742
that's hosted in public cloud. But they've managed to use IAM to move

298
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,202
laterally in the environment and pivot onto other systems until they can

299
00:18:12,256 --> 00:18:16,262
eventually get data out. And there have been some large financial institutions

300
00:18:16,326 --> 00:18:19,718
and some other software vendors who have fallen foul to this recently. So it's

301
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:22,958
definitely out there. It's definitely happening, and it's definitely being abused. Things like the

302
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:26,650
mitreattack framework can help you address what areas

303
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,398
you need to focus on. So with IAM and authorization being

304
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,042
such a broad topic, tools like that can help you focus your efforts

305
00:18:34,106 --> 00:18:37,522
on the different vectors that you have in your environment and what

306
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,266
types of security you need to put in place around those tools and

307
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,878
services to at least cover the basics off. The last part I'll

308
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:48,098
put as a threat, and it's kind of something that you can do to combat

309
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,586
the other threats as well. And this is agility and visibility.

310
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:55,510
So one of the biggest problems that we see with customers isn't

311
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,170
they're not necessarily worried immediately about zero days

312
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,878
and advanced threats and apts and other people getting in and pillaging

313
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:08,326
the cloud accounts to find very niche vulnerabilities and abusing

314
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:11,498
IAM to get from service to service. At this point, a lot

315
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:14,874
of customers are concerned about what they've got in cloud from a

316
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:18,606
c level or an executive perspective. They don't know what cloud is

317
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:22,506
to them, so they have no visibility of what workloads they're

318
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:26,322
using, where the workloads are, whether they're compliant with any particular

319
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,554
frameworks. GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act,

320
00:19:29,592 --> 00:19:32,738
CCPA, that's the one. I remember the acronym. Finally, any of

321
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:36,318
these frameworks are a huge concern to CSOC levels

322
00:19:36,334 --> 00:19:39,462
and execs. So for them, they just want to know what they're doing in public

323
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:42,610
cloud. They're not worried about the misconfigurations.

324
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,194
They are, but not directly to the level of do I have the right ACL

325
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:49,478
on my file storage thing? They want to know,

326
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,538
does somebody have a handle on everything that's going on in public cloud?

327
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,406
And you can get some of this from the cloud platforms, but it's

328
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:59,750
not laid out for you in a nice, easily consumable manner.

329
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,358
You quite often have to dig around, find all these different details, and put the

330
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:07,214
pieces together yourself to give you a really complete picture of what

331
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:10,846
your cloud presence, and therefore attack surface means. You have to

332
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:14,138
look at different panels, different tabs, different views, different windows,

333
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:17,682
sometimes even different platforms altogether. If you're a large enough

334
00:20:17,736 --> 00:20:21,358
company that you consume multiple cloud platforms, then you're just multiplying

335
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:24,722
the problem. So you've got now two platforms where you don't know

336
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:27,586
where to look for the different assets, to see what you've got deployed in what

337
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:31,874
regions and what state they're in. So visibility, I think, is fundamental

338
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:35,394
to getting control of what you've got in your cloud platforms,

339
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,694
and then agility as well. And this is something that I touched on a little

340
00:20:38,732 --> 00:20:42,346
with the cloud maturity diagram. So as

341
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:45,754
your cloud level of experience and maturity gets stronger and you get

342
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:49,514
more experience in cloud, you start to do things more quickly with

343
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:52,634
that. The business gets used to that agility and wants to keep

344
00:20:52,672 --> 00:20:55,946
up that cadence of releasing things very quickly and very rapidly,

345
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:59,454
that eventually there might be a slight tilt towards let's get things

346
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,494
out there and then we'll worry about security later.

347
00:21:02,612 --> 00:21:06,142
More often than not, that later never happens until somebody else

348
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:09,854
finds your deployment in a somewhat secure, maybe insecure

349
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,894
state and they will be able to take advantage of it. And the whole argument

350
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,626
of oh well, we were planning on securing it today, tomorrow, later is

351
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:20,210
irrelevant. Your data is gone. There's someone in there, somebody has damaged

352
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,638
your reputation, they've got your ip. You need to do this as

353
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:27,334
soon as you can. Security needs to be a primary consideration when you're moving

354
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:31,610
to cloud. It shouldn't be an afterthought. And with the agility,

355
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:36,038
the roles and the responsibilities have changed when it comes to securing what you've

356
00:21:36,054 --> 00:21:39,558
got in public cloud. The security team that the traditional heads,

357
00:21:39,654 --> 00:21:43,114
they're no longer the ones that are in control. It's now with the developers.

358
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:46,730
We mentioned this again on the cloud security maturity

359
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,062
diagram. Even if there is a relationship between

360
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:53,486
those teams, they might not have overlaps. It might be that

361
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:56,946
the legacy teams are far too legacy and they don't know how to

362
00:21:56,968 --> 00:22:00,418
talk to the cloud developers, the engineers, the architects, the people who

363
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:03,922
are pushing out these services for consumption by customers. There's no common

364
00:22:03,976 --> 00:22:07,042
ground if you've got the technology team who are still talking about firewalls,

365
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:10,658
and you've got the DevOps team, the cloud architects,

366
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:13,986
whoever it might be talking about, pushing out serverless functions

367
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:17,110
to cater for services to be used by customers.

368
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,422
The firewall team can't put a firewall in front of that in a traditional sense.

369
00:22:20,476 --> 00:22:23,690
So the teams just operate in isolation, hoping for the best.

370
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,498
Agility in that sense is a threat. It's one of these weird ones that

371
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:31,018
you turn around to be a strength as well later on, provided that you

372
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:34,174
bake security into your agility. But that's again

373
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:37,934
a slightly different topic for consideration. So what

374
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:41,614
do we see as solutions to this? I've mentioned commercial offerings in here,

375
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:45,694
again, not here to pitch. Commercial offerings are available on the visibility side of

376
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:49,330
things. I think this is a really important thing to get started

377
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,186
with when it comes to cloud deployments. If you don't know what you've deployed in

378
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,594
public cloud, you have pretty much no hope of securing it. So make sure

379
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:59,526
you're making the best use of what native tools you've got available.

380
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,026
Anything that lets you set up monitoring on logs,

381
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:07,010
whether it's network logs, API logs, user interaction logs,

382
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,298
you need to make sure you've got that turned on. Quite often in the

383
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:13,754
cloud platforms, logging isn't on by default because that

384
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,094
consumes storage space, which costs money. Some of the analytics

385
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:20,986
services associated with looking at the logs, they're not free either. They will cost

386
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,826
a fairly nominal fee in some situations. Some of them are horrendously

387
00:23:24,858 --> 00:23:28,414
expensive, so obviously take that into consideration, but try and get some

388
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:31,662
visibility of everything. Don't have any service which is available

389
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:35,694
to users or even developers and internal teams that doesn't have some level

390
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:38,962
of logging on it to see what's going on. If the worst happens and someone

391
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:42,482
does manage to get into your environment, into the cloud environment, the lambda function,

392
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:46,194
the container environment, whatever it might be. If you've got some logs, you can start

393
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:49,326
somewhere, you can see how they got in, you can hopefully fix it and prevent

394
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:52,438
it happening in the future. If you haven't got any visibility of what's going on,

395
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:55,958
things are going to be rough. Then misconfiguration. Again, this is a

396
00:23:55,964 --> 00:23:59,062
very broad topic to cover, so I won't be able to cover everything here,

397
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:02,486
but I think automation is the key. And again, couple that with visibility.

398
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:06,534
There are some fairly decent tools out there in the native platforms

399
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:10,234
that you can use for some are free, some of them are not

400
00:24:10,272 --> 00:24:13,546
free, but they're not extortionate either. And again, commercial offerings are available,

401
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:17,294
but where they're available, and especially where they're free, make sure you're turning them on.

402
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,878
Things like AWS, trusted advisor, they can help out as well. They can give

403
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:24,494
you recommendations on some real easy to fix things like

404
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:27,498
your s three bucket there that's got world writable permissions.

405
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:31,054
That's a very bad thing. Don't do that, turn it off. There are more complex

406
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,954
recommendations as well. That's just a common one that tends to come up when talking

407
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:37,960
to customers who are new to cloud environments. But misconfiguration is

408
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,862
such an obvious thing to happen, especially when you consider

409
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:46,146
how many services there are and how many of those services have got such diverse

410
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:49,366
configurations about them. Again, if you're using more than one cloud platform,

411
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:52,998
that's multiplied by the amount of cloud platforms you've got, because the service that

412
00:24:53,004 --> 00:24:56,262
you're using in one is almost certainly not going to be the same in another

413
00:24:56,316 --> 00:24:58,966
platform. So you've got to learn one way to do it in this platform one

414
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:02,270
way to do it in another, and it's very little consistency between platform

415
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,310
a and platform b. It might be completely different,

416
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,014
completely worlds apart when you're configuring these different things.

417
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:11,482
So trying to automate it where you can can help you achieve

418
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:15,086
a level of consistency across those platforms. But make sure you're

419
00:25:15,118 --> 00:25:19,166
testing that automation I have seen some fairly awful situations

420
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:22,110
where something has been automated, not particularly well tested,

421
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,874
and that automation has just led to mass deployments of

422
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:28,530
badly configured things. So in one example,

423
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,614
fortunately, I didn't make it out of testing. It was automating permission application

424
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,878
for a storage facility in a cloud platform. But they got the

425
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:39,266
permissions wrong. So it wasn't just one poorly configured storage

426
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:42,646
service, it was hundreds if not thousands of poorly

427
00:25:42,678 --> 00:25:45,946
configured services. Fortunately, it was noticed fairly early on and

428
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:50,026
they managed to update it via automation, via the templating engine they

429
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,238
were using, and fix it at scale. So if you can automate,

430
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:56,238
brilliant. But make sure you're paying that attention as well, because that can be a

431
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:59,854
whole different rabbit hole to fall into if you've got poor automation practices in place.

432
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:03,710
Native tools I've mentioned this, some are good, some are better than nothing,

433
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,026
some are free and some are not free. So make sure at

434
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:10,674
least to get the bare minimum covered and then on to IAM. So this is

435
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:14,434
probably the hardest area to give any really easy

436
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:18,366
suggestions for. There's so much to cover. There are numerous

437
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:21,960
tools in the platforms, each of them are very diverse and very different.

438
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:25,974
It's unfortunately something you just have to spend some time on. It's worth it though.

439
00:26:26,012 --> 00:26:29,222
It is a worthwhile investment to get these right,

440
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:32,170
because they can save you a lot of pain and suffering in the future.

441
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,314
If, for example, I mentioned one of the larger, more media focused and

442
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:39,606
highlighted breaches in the last couple of years that did rely

443
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:43,406
heavily on poorly configured permissions in the

444
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:47,470
cloud account. So when the attacker was in, they managed to basically

445
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,858
knock on the doors to see which ones were open and abuse

446
00:26:50,874 --> 00:26:54,126
the high reveals of privileges on certain services,

447
00:26:54,308 --> 00:26:58,174
then get onto that one and escalate those throughout the environment to ultimately

448
00:26:58,222 --> 00:27:01,666
get data out. Now, if you take the time from the outset and make sure

449
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,834
that you're using IAM, you're using security groups rather than

450
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:08,094
assigning privileges directly to users, following the best practices.

451
00:27:08,142 --> 00:27:11,718
At least that will help a lot when it comes to

452
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:15,654
securing what you've got in your public cloud environments and making sure

453
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:19,282
that if the worst happens and somebody does manage to exploit a vulnerability

454
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:23,222
in a software package, or manage to find something that is poorly configured,

455
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:26,474
you're limiting the blast radius and the

456
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:29,878
area of effect of what they can do from that service that they have managed

457
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:32,486
to get a foothold on. If they've managed to get onto, let's say an EC

458
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:36,286
two instance that doesn't have fully open permissions to everything in not

459
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:39,594
just that account, but any of the adjacent accounts to it as well, you're limiting

460
00:27:39,642 --> 00:27:43,454
what they can do. Yes, it's bad, but it's far easier to fix than a

461
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:47,246
multiple account affecting breach. Where they've got in, they've got a foothold.

462
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:50,930
Maybe they've even got access to the account. Difficult to say.

463
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,914
Attackers are very persistent, and if there is a weakness, they will pursue it until

464
00:27:54,952 --> 00:27:58,062
they get what they want, which is ultimately data or resources,

465
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:01,686
be it a crypto mining resource or something else. If they don't want

466
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,642
your data, they will be in there for something they won't leave empty handed.

467
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:07,718
So take your time. Get this bit right. There are some tools out there,

468
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:11,974
not necessarily tools, in saying yes, your IAM solution is configured perfectly

469
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:16,214
well done, but tools to make sure you're not giving your users too many permissions.

470
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:19,414
Something like permissions boundaries if you're using AWS,

471
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:23,258
this is a really useful tool, and a fairly simple tool as well, to make

472
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:27,246
sure that no matter what the scenario is, a user in a particular area

473
00:28:27,428 --> 00:28:30,606
can't get more permissions than their boundary gives them. That's a

474
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:34,334
really powerful tool to make sure that your user in one

475
00:28:34,372 --> 00:28:37,634
situation they don't have read and list permissions for something,

476
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:41,294
but accidentally you've given them root permissions somewhere else. A permission boundary

477
00:28:41,342 --> 00:28:44,654
can be a really powerful tool for making sure they don't cross

478
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:48,826
over from a read owner user into a readroot

479
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:52,626
user, which is a fairly bad example, but you get the picture.

480
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:55,750
Use what you've got. It is a time consuming area.

481
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,314
If you're not familiar with it, read the documentation. Look at the best practice

482
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,566
guides. There are some fairly lengthy documents out

483
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:05,818
there, and they're quite difficult and painful to read. If you've been through any of

484
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:09,370
the certifications, I'm sure you've had the pleasure of looking at the different IAM options

485
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,922
available, but it is useful and it's a worthwhile

486
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:16,398
investment in terms of brain space and time invested when it

487
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:20,554
comes to cloud security. So some quick takeaways

488
00:29:20,602 --> 00:29:24,702
from this session. Not everyone is a cloud expert. Businesses are very different

489
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:28,146
levels when it comes to cloud adoption. So what might be

490
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:32,446
normal day to day operation for you as you're managing a huge container

491
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:36,222
architecture with lots of microservices scattered across multiple cloud platforms.

492
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:39,942
The person who is considering cloud next might be very new to cloud,

493
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:43,462
and they might be looking at deploying their first instance into the cloud.

494
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:47,350
So for them, their interest in security and the threats that they're interested

495
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,806
in might be very different to you. There's no right or wrong. Everybody wants to

496
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:54,406
secure their workloads and their presence in cloud environments just don't

497
00:29:54,518 --> 00:29:57,482
look too unkindly on people who are new to cloud.

498
00:29:57,616 --> 00:30:00,586
You were new to it at one point, so you didn't get to the level

499
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:03,706
of cloud expertise you're at today without making the same mistakes that people that are

500
00:30:03,728 --> 00:30:06,986
new to cloud make. So be kind to people. It's a fairly

501
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:10,686
intimidating place, is cloud, and there's a lot to take in in

502
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:14,158
a fairly short amount of time, especially if you want to make the most of

503
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:17,918
it and not find yourself falling foul of misconfiguration and some of the

504
00:30:17,924 --> 00:30:21,454
other nasty things we've spoken about. And businesses still see cloud

505
00:30:21,492 --> 00:30:25,266
as new technology in some parts. Not everyone, most people are aware

506
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:28,566
of cloud now, but when I first started out sort of talking about cloud and

507
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:31,974
working with cloud, with customers, there were some people who had no idea about cloud.

508
00:30:32,092 --> 00:30:34,518
I think it's fairly safe to assume that most people have at least heard of

509
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:37,366
it now and know some of the benefits and some of the threats that might

510
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:40,774
face them if they were to move into cloud. So that's a very

511
00:30:40,812 --> 00:30:43,846
brief summary of some of the customer types that I speak to on a day

512
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:46,630
to day basis, some of the threats they face,

513
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,478
and some of the general solutions on how aim to

514
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:53,758
fix them. And thank you to conf 42 for allowing us to

515
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:53,820
present.
