00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:31,522
Hi, everyone. Welcome to my talk. My name is Riaz Virani.

2
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:34,918
I'm a freelance web developer and you can read more

3
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:38,406
of my stuff at Riazv me. Today's topic, the thing

4
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:41,974
I'm going to talk about is called five tips for success. How to thrive at

5
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:45,666
your first dev job. And forgive me, this next slide

6
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:49,126
is designed obviously for a talk that's live. But I do want to

7
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:52,400
take a second and actually have you introspect a little bit

8
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,078
because I'm assuming that a number of you especially

9
00:00:56,244 --> 00:01:00,074
are kind of from this perspective of like you actually are breaking into the industry.

10
00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:02,974
You either are about to start your first job, you're either in a boot camp

11
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:06,366
looking to finish your first job or, sorry, finish the camp and get your first

12
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:09,486
job. Or maybe you're just in the throes of the challenges I'm going to talk

13
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:12,606
about in the first few months. If you're not, if you've been doing this for

14
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,974
a few years, this is kind of your chance to just take a second to

15
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:20,086
reset yourself and think about what your experience was like when you did join the

16
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:23,046
industry and kind of break into your first job. I want you to kind of

17
00:01:23,068 --> 00:01:26,582
channel that energy because it'll help you empathize and help

18
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:30,578
other people on your team as they're joining. So I'm

19
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:33,818
going to tell you a little bit of a story. Right. It's going to kind

20
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:36,538
of guide us through this talk. So I want you to meet a friend of

21
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:39,814
mine. Her name is Ruby. She wants to be a developer.

22
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:43,742
And yes, I am a ruby developer. So that's kind of the inside

23
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:47,374
joke there. Sure, some of you don't like Ruby or rails or whatever, that's fine,

24
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:50,794
you don't have to, but our character is going to be named

25
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:54,478
Ruby. So Ruby musters up

26
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:57,630
the courage to go join a software bootcamp.

27
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,566
It's one of these bootcamps that is sort of fairly common. It's a huge source

28
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:04,914
of sort of developers into our industry. One of these like three to six month

29
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:08,386
things. She's a little bit nervous and anxious, as you would be

30
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:11,718
if you're leaving your job and entering something new and paying a lot

31
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:15,206
of money. Those of you might notice there is

32
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:18,086
a boot on top of the building because it's a boot camp. That's what they

33
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:21,846
did. So Ruby comes in and kills at the boot

34
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:25,626
camp, right? And some of you may have actually felt that

35
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:28,538
you struggled a bit in the boot camp, but in this case, doesn't really matter.

36
00:02:28,624 --> 00:02:32,554
Our character, Ruby, did a fantastic job and

37
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:36,506
soaked in a ton of knowledge and information. She finishes the

38
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:40,366
bootcamp and she is really diligent about working all of the things

39
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:44,046
that the bootcamp and everything on the Internet is telling you about how

40
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:46,740
to get a job. She does everything in her power to get a job.

41
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,606
She builds a portfolio site. She's out at meetups, networking.

42
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:54,654
I guess in today's age, if you're in a place that is mostly doing virtual

43
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:58,310
work, you're networking on slack or other sort of online technology

44
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,230
groups. She's doing open source projects. She's doing codecadas to prepare for interviews

45
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,806
and she lands the job. She does an amazing job at

46
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:10,486
her interviews and she lands the job. Some of you may have again, had more

47
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:13,526
of a struggle to get to this part. And I don't want to dismiss how

48
00:03:13,548 --> 00:03:16,498
much of a challenge it is to get someone to trust you when you don't

49
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:19,622
have a ton of experience to say, yes, I'll take a chance on this person

50
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:22,462
and give, give them a shot and have them join my team. It is actually

51
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:25,646
quite challenging, and a number of you probably are in that phase where you're trying

52
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:29,566
to get it. But now here comes the next question. Now what?

53
00:03:29,748 --> 00:03:33,150
So the gist of this talk is not about everything

54
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,686
we've talked about so far. It's that a number of people, especially now

55
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,226
that I've been doing this for like twelve years, really struggle when

56
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:43,394
they join a team. I'm a freelance developer right now, but in my past life

57
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:47,106
I've been a CTO, I've been a project manager and run teams.

58
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:50,946
A lot of new developers have come onto my teams. It turns

59
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:55,122
out that there's a lot of commonalities

60
00:03:55,186 --> 00:03:58,770
in the struggle that first year devs experience

61
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,014
across companies. Again, first year. I'm talking specifically about their first year in programming

62
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:06,506
in general as a professional engineer, not necessarily just their

63
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,380
first year at that particular company.

64
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,850
I'm hoping somebody can sympathize. Yeah, there's a lot of challenges that kind of occur.

65
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,246
I just don't think we talk about it enough. We talk so much about how

66
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:20,846
to get people jobs, we don't often talk about the things that

67
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:24,026
they need to do to succeed at those jobs when they break in. And there's

68
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:27,506
a couple of skill sets that aren't even purely technical that I found consistently help

69
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:31,186
people out. In some ways, I'm actually coming to this talk from

70
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:34,866
the perspective of actually had a lot of challenges, just like

71
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:38,546
everyone has when I'm also helping first year devs as well, because it's a really

72
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:42,006
big adjustment. And I think a lot of the failures actually come from people like

73
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:44,902
me and leadership who don't actually know how to onboard those people.

74
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:48,678
But if you're a junior dev, you can only kind of control what's in front

75
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,930
of you, what you can do. And these are some of the tips.

76
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,566
So here are the famous five tips.

77
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:58,438
Here's the meat and potatoes of this talk. I put kind of catchphrases

78
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:02,058
around them and we're going to dive into each single one as we go along.

79
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:05,678
The first one is ask and you shall receive. So the idea

80
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,214
there is to make sure that you are not just struggling silently like

81
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:13,194
there is a time and a place to ask for help. And knowing

82
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:17,086
when the right time is is kind of an art that sometimes senior developers

83
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:20,206
have gained over time. But a lot of junior developers,

84
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:23,730
they just don't ask enough for help when they get stuck. Secondly,

85
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,146
it's called right now, worry later. And that's really about not

86
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:31,414
being afraid of your code. You're going to make mistakes, you're going to write

87
00:05:31,452 --> 00:05:34,566
a lot of stuff that doesn't work, and you need

88
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:38,374
to have the courage to kind of just go through that process. Three is go

89
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:41,526
deep, not wide. Specifically, this is a response to a lot

90
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:45,178
of boot camps that try to, as a marketing pharmaceutist, teach you a

91
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:47,866
lot of different things because you can kind of say, oh, I learned this.

92
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:51,606
I learned how to do iOS development and python development and front end development

93
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,826
and Ruby development, but it's not actually the

94
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:58,078
right way to approach it. When you're trying to enter a company

95
00:05:58,164 --> 00:06:01,306
and make sure that you can contribute in a way that's productive and respectful

96
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:05,038
of your team and for your own growth. Fourth, dont put your teammates in

97
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:08,862
a pedestal. So the crux of that idea is to not assume everything

98
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,158
that a senior developer tells you is actually the right answer. Most of

99
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,686
the time, they're your peers. They're figuring it out as well. I've seen a number

100
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,758
of times where I might give someone an idea when they ask me for help.

101
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:22,086
Turns out it's a bad idea. And they didn't tell me when we

102
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,966
kind of went through it, when they worked on it for a little bit because

103
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:27,958
they were afraid to tell me I was wrong. And this just came from kind

104
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:32,006
of the culture of that company, which causes

105
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:35,340
a lot of problems because people actually need to be able to

106
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,222
voice their opinions freely. The final one is more of a tactical

107
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:42,778
tip. It's one of the few that's less sort of abstract. It's called pseudocode is

108
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:46,446
your friend. The idea here is when you're joining a

109
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:49,674
new company, you're starting out, you don't actually have the syntax of second nature

110
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:53,118
of whatever programming language you're in and senior developers generally do.

111
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,622
And so to separate out the stages of when you're programming into different phases,

112
00:06:56,686 --> 00:07:00,450
that'll actually help you get through the logic and then the syntax separately.

113
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,862
But let's get into detail. So the very first tip,

114
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:08,178
ask and you shall receive. So we're going to go

115
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:11,318
back to our story. Ruby's going to join us along the way.

116
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:15,286
She's our friend, of course. So Ruby gets a ticket, but she's not sure how

117
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:18,646
to proceed. She's afraid she's going to do it wrong and be found out as

118
00:07:18,668 --> 00:07:22,710
a fraud. What does she do? So this is the classic, like imagine

119
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,506
you're a brand new developer, you join a company and they're like, great, they do

120
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:29,722
some onboarding, but at some point they're going to ask you to write some code

121
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:32,620
and they give you a ticket and you're sitting there.

122
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,574
Some cultures, they may pair program with you and that's great, but in many they

123
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:40,154
don't. In which case you're sitting there being like, I don't know how to approach

124
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:43,342
this, or you may have an inkling of how to approach it, but you're absolutely

125
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:47,166
terrified of being found out as an imposter. And sort of impostor syndrome

126
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:51,074
in the software world is a really common thing. And that

127
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:53,694
probably should have been the title of this section.

128
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:57,654
So here's a really important

129
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:01,046
point. You cannot wait forever to ask for

130
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:04,086
help, or you cannot just throw your hands up and give up.

131
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,606
I've kind of seen people generally, when they're doing this

132
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:10,886
wrong, oscillate on one of the two extremes. They'll get

133
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,994
a ticket and every morning in a stand up they might be saying, I'm working

134
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:17,654
on this, I'm working on this. Without telling anyone. They're really struggling

135
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:21,306
and they have kind of just been thrashing around. They haven't really figured out how

136
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:24,454
to tackle it. And the other one is they at some point get so frustrated,

137
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:27,646
they come and say, I just can't do this, and they throw their hands up

138
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:31,018
in the air. And that tends to be sort of the worst outcome.

139
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:35,146
Also the fact that more time they spend on it now, the harder

140
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:38,574
it is to ask for help. And therefore, like, you'd be kind of being,

141
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:41,486
obviously, I haven't gone anywhere in three days and I've just been giving an update

142
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:45,202
that I'm just working on it. Obviously the answer is to ask for help,

143
00:08:45,336 --> 00:08:49,246
but I want to kind of address a quick point. Usually whenever

144
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,194
I do these kinds of presentations and I've been in the audience, there's an element

145
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:56,646
in me that listens to sort of the proposal of the sort of soft

146
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:59,798
skills thing to do. And there's always a hidden part of my mind that's kind

147
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:03,498
of like, yeah, it's not that easy. And there's this sort

148
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:07,466
of like secret internal link of what the argument is that doesn't really hang up.

149
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:11,366
And the argument here is a junior developer could say, but won't

150
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:13,546
I annoy people if I ask for it? Won't I be found out as an

151
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:17,214
imposter? And there's kind of a very specific answer here,

152
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:20,686
which is you have to ask, but you have to ask intelligently. And I just

153
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,486
put a paragraph in here of what I would say if I was in that

154
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:26,926
circumstance, which is probably the best illustration. Right. I'm just going to read

155
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:29,534
it out loud. So let's say you're in a morning stand up. Hi, everyone.

156
00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:33,086
So I'm currently working on x feature. I'm still working through the right approach for

157
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:36,486
it, but right now y seems the best. I'm going to keep at it for

158
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:39,926
today, but if I dont make good progress, I'd like to grab someone else from

159
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:44,070
the team really quickly tomorrow to talk it through and get me unstuck.

160
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,862
So kind of think through what happened there,

161
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,820
right? I didn't just go and say, I don't know how to do this,

162
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,834
and throw my hands up in the air and ask

163
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:58,906
for someone else to come and get involved and just sort of give me the

164
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:02,298
answer. I kind of was like, look, I do need to do some work on

165
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:05,854
this. I need to spend a little bit of time thrashing to

166
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:08,798
poke at kind of the approaches I'm thinking of. As a result,

167
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:12,074
when I do have, if I can't make any progress and I don't feel confident

168
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:15,246
with the approach, whenever I do ask for someone's time, I can be like,

169
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:18,450
okay, here is the problem. I thought this, I tried that.

170
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,970
I tried that. I looked this up online, it's not working.

171
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,890
Help me get unstuck. And I didn't also ask. Unstuck is a pretty specific

172
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,758
word. It's not do this for me. I can't do this. It's help me

173
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:33,206
get the next incremental bit of information that I need in order

174
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:36,806
to move forward to maybe the next part of the challenge. Right. The next part

175
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:40,214
of the ticket. And as a manager, this would be amazing to me

176
00:10:40,252 --> 00:10:43,526
because I'd be sitting there going, okay, so you've identified there's a problem. You've given

177
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:46,710
me those information that right now you're actually struggling. So I'm already forewarned about that.

178
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,950
You've given me a timetable in which you're going to work on it yourself.

179
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,398
And then you've told me what your next step is going to be, which is

180
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:55,002
not to throw your hands up in the air. It's to ask for a limited

181
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:58,766
piece of help to get you to the next phase. And I'm like,

182
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:02,206
you have done my job for me as a manager. Right? You will gain so

183
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,806
many brownie points if you try this approach where you're being very considerate

184
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:09,470
about how much time you're drawing, but also making sure you keep progressing

185
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,766
and communicating versus doing one of those two extremes

186
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,434
of either working on it silently and thrashing or just giving

187
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:20,374
up too quickly. So next point right

188
00:11:20,412 --> 00:11:24,134
now, worry later. So this is a little bit of play

189
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:27,526
on words and we'll go back to Ruby to kind of get an

190
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:30,918
example of what we mean. So Ruby does the

191
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,106
best she can and puts up a pr to the ticket we talked about in

192
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:37,558
the last point. The next day, it's got 20 comments

193
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:41,174
and has been sent back. She will have to start over. She's crushed.

194
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:44,170
She's not even sure if she wants those job anymore.

195
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,206
If you're someone, and again, if, you know, if you're more experienced, this happened to

196
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:52,254
you, right? And if you're a junior developer, it's definitely happened to you where you

197
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:55,406
think you've got it and you put it in and someone just shits all

198
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:58,994
over your code and it just really crushes you.

199
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:02,434
So I'm not going to really spend a lot of time on the point that

200
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:06,046
it's completely okay to mark up a pr, but if you recognize someone's

201
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,518
new and they may really be trying to get their confidence, you should probably

202
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,686
include a note in there being like, hey, by the way, I know this is

203
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:15,414
a lot. You still did a really good job. Let's just

204
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:19,314
work on these and we'll continue to improve.

205
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:22,358
Like, giving them that little pat on the back can be really dramatic, but let's

206
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,754
say you didn't get that because it's, again, as a junior developer, not within your

207
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,954
control. Here's my answer,

208
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:32,460
and this is somewhat controversial. When I've kind of talked about this with other people,

209
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,742
the thing within your control is kind of how you respond and the answer

210
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:41,562
isn't be perfect. And the answer isn't, oh, just feel good generically.

211
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,702
You have to kind of get an understanding of the fact that you are new.

212
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:48,478
You're going to write a lot of mediocre code as you improve.

213
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:52,210
You need to embrace it and just ask your teammates to embrace the process

214
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,794
as well. What I mean specifically by that

215
00:12:55,832 --> 00:12:59,326
is like, interview examples. You think about classic

216
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,246
ways to get good at anything. You're going to be bad at it whenever you

217
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:06,226
start. If you're just starting in the industry as the first time you're really writing

218
00:13:06,258 --> 00:13:09,606
code in a professional context, that means most of

219
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:12,118
the time you're not going to be doing things as well as someone else who's

220
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:16,614
doing it for five years. That doesn't mean you're bad, it just means you're

221
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:20,106
learning. Fitness is a good example.

222
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,018
You cannot beat yourself up. If you think of fitness when you go into the

223
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:26,174
gym and you can't do the pull up like someone else can, it just means

224
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:30,606
it's part of the process. You need to embrace the process and not necessarily be

225
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:33,520
upset that you're not meeting some standard you've set out.

226
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,662
So here's the sort of like, little voice in the back of your head,

227
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,846
right, thinks it's like, right, so I just do my job poorly, just like,

228
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:43,454
write shitty code and that's somehow okay, right?

229
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:47,080
And have everyone look me that I'm the weak link on the team.

230
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,818
Not really your job. This is kind of all of our jobs

231
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:54,054
as engineers is really to try. And if you're new, I know there's a whole

232
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:57,366
bunch of personal emotion mixed up in that because you're also trying to establish your

233
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:00,902
own career. But there's a very big difference between

234
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:04,326
someone who's trying their best and continuing to improve,

235
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:07,754
and people notice that. And the thing I put on here is like, shitty code

236
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,874
is very different from flawed code written by people trying their best. It just is.

237
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:13,754
I mean, I'm sure everyone who's been doing this for a while has noticed people

238
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,722
who just don't care. And if you are also consistently

239
00:14:17,786 --> 00:14:20,142
showing that when someone does point out a way to make your stuff better,

240
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:24,370
that you really respond, they'll give you a lot of leeway

241
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,974
in the sense that you're not going to be constantly

242
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:32,818
battling people's response to you as like, oh, you're the

243
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:35,810
one who's just doing stuff, really. So don't be afraid of your code.

244
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,654
Like, the biggest point here is don't be afraid. Whatever it is, just keep

245
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:42,440
going, just keep going, just keep going, you'll get there.

246
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,946
All right, point number three, go deep, not wide.

247
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:50,758
So as I mentioned earlier, this is really a response to

248
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:54,346
how sometimes I've noticed boot camps teaching way too many things or people on

249
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:57,946
their own because there's such a plethora of things you need to do to

250
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:01,934
learn DevOps to front end, to backend to whatever in the world of web

251
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:05,520
development, they just spread themselves too wide at the start.

252
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,642
So let's go back to Ruby continued.

253
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:14,030
Ruby loves learning. At her boot camp they taught her seven programming languages and frameworks.

254
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,034
She feels overwhelmed with where to focus on her new job. It all seems too

255
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:20,100
advanced compared to her boot camp.

256
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,100
I think what kind of happens here, this is really what happens.

257
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,746
Boot camps and those tech zeitgeist if you're trying to beat up on the

258
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:33,126
news, especially in the JavaScript world, there's a little bit of

259
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:37,046
an excessive obsession with the new and excessive variety and

260
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:40,514
it's kind of your job not to get sucked into it. Not because learning

261
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,166
new things is bad, but most junior

262
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,594
developers don't fail because they dont know enough of a diversity of things. It's because

263
00:15:47,632 --> 00:15:50,986
they don't know any one thing sufficiently well to be productive on

264
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:54,806
the team. So they're

265
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:58,078
kind of like master of none. And that's kind of where you want to get

266
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:01,246
in the long run. But in the immediate term when you're just new, you want

267
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:03,920
to be able to get really good at one thing,

268
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,226
and sort of voice in those back of your head is like, well, if I

269
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:12,482
do that, I'll never really be a fully routed developer. The answer is

270
00:16:12,616 --> 00:16:15,746
not exactly focus is important when

271
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:18,920
you start, you get really good at things when you focus on them,

272
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,126
and so you focus on one specific technology that your team needs help with and

273
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,566
then specific expertise will give you the credibility and the

274
00:16:26,748 --> 00:16:29,750
ability over time to be productive. Like you'll learn the rest.

275
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,106
And what I mean by that is like hey, you're a junior developer, they know

276
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:36,714
that you're going to need additional time, additional support, but let's say you

277
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:39,734
have a good example is like there's a lot of developers that are more backend

278
00:16:39,782 --> 00:16:43,614
heavy and then I'm thinking from a rails perspective, right, because rails is

279
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:46,798
backend heavy and then they'll learn JavaScript in

280
00:16:46,804 --> 00:16:50,058
the front end really just because they have to to deliver

281
00:16:50,154 --> 00:16:53,914
their application. But usually they're not design experts,

282
00:16:53,962 --> 00:16:57,118
right? Most back end developers dont really like CSS,

283
00:16:57,294 --> 00:17:00,900
so they've kind of hacked things together or maybe just used

284
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,362
bootstrap or sort of a theme and they really

285
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:09,006
struggle with that. Well, it turns out maybe you specifically

286
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,520
like CSS and you like design and you like learning about that stuff

287
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,966
even though you want to learn everything else. Focus in that area. Talk with your

288
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,822
manager, be like, hey, what if I focused here? I really cleaned up our css.

289
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:24,714
Well, now your manager has this sort of foundation so

290
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,262
that when you're interacting with the team, you have a locus of expertise

291
00:17:28,326 --> 00:17:32,058
and credibility. You can be productive and contribute. And now you've got

292
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:34,899
all this time, all those other stuff that goes on in that team is going

293
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,958
to get absorbed into your head right, over time. Because you're probably going to go

294
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:42,298
from CSS to more and more into front end stuff, right? Because you're

295
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:45,614
going to be executing features and then from there you'll expand more and more

296
00:17:45,652 --> 00:17:48,818
to the back end and then more and more to the DevOps, right. It'll always

297
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:52,626
be that there's another challenge you can focus on. But if

298
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:56,098
you're always in training and not really able to contribute to the team, that's going

299
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:59,586
to cause them to have a much difficult or

300
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:03,158
different opinion on of you. Because if you solve the CSS problem and

301
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:06,582
then you ask for help, well, now it's like, no, this person was awesome.

302
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:09,178
They did a great job on that. It is worth my time to try to

303
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:12,906
teach them and help them. So that's a

304
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:16,666
really good thing to keep in mind. So next point, don't put

305
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:20,474
your teammates on a pedestal. We talked earlier about the fact

306
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:23,786
that senior developers are not magicians.

307
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:27,738
Right. Software engineering is an art. So it's

308
00:18:27,754 --> 00:18:31,226
a very different perspective than maybe some other things that have these very precise inputs

309
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:34,894
and outputs. So don't assume they always know what they mean

310
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:38,626
or that they've communicated it clearly, or that they wouldn't try the idea they gave

311
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:41,282
you and then realize, oh, it sucks, and try something else. Right.

312
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:45,294
So let's go back to Ruby. A senior developer

313
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:48,646
gives Ruby some guidance on the ticket, but it's not working. What does she

314
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:52,120
do? She doesn't want to disrespect the senior developer by doing it her.

315
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,040
Hmm. So what do you do?

316
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,578
I think here it's kind of related to the first point and it's really about

317
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:05,222
communication. But you do have to have some courage to realize

318
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:08,614
that you cannot force a square peg into a round

319
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:12,282
hole. And your job, like your responsibility to the team,

320
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:15,866
is not necessarily to not say, I don't know if this is the right approach.

321
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:19,166
I'm trying this and it's causing a lot of friction. It's your job to

322
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:22,670
voice the pain and friction that you're noticing.

323
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,340
That is actually the most important thing you can do.

324
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,094
Oftentimes what will happen is it turns out like whatever you're noticing,

325
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:35,218
if you actually point it out, the senior developer is going to be like,

326
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:37,790
yeah, actually, now that I look at it, it doesn't exactly work the way I

327
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,726
think. Or the other most common one is, no,

328
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:44,518
you misinterpreted what I said because developers are pretty bad at saying,

329
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:47,846
like, speaking code. I actually kind of mean this. And you're like,

330
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:51,334
okay, that makes a lot more sense. Now, here's something that's really important.

331
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:54,294
The longer you wait to do this, like you say, you take the approach,

332
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:57,146
you start working on it for a day, it's like clearly there's something off.

333
00:19:57,248 --> 00:20:00,378
You wait two or three more days to bring that up.

334
00:20:00,544 --> 00:20:03,438
Now you've got a little bit of a politics problem because let's say there's a

335
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,666
manager who's given that senior developer the assignment to guide

336
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:10,686
you through this ticket. If you wait really long and then

337
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:14,638
those becomes a problem, that senior developer now has to cover their ass

338
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:18,238
because they have to make the points like, no, you're doing it wrong. It wasn't

339
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:21,886
that I didn't notice that you were trying the wrong approach

340
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:25,490
for several days. Right. So the earlier you can communicate,

341
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,854
the better benefit you're going to have. And that's why again, the answer here

342
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:34,582
is communication. Your job is to communicate about the code

343
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:38,214
across your team. And the final point, again, senior developers are

344
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:41,786
not God, they're your peers. Tell the senior developer what

345
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:44,986
you found and ask for clarification. Half the time it turns out their approach was

346
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,700
wrong and they'll admit it. Right?

347
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,818
So pseudocode is your friend.

348
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,022
This is the final point. Now, this is a bit different than the other ones

349
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:58,954
because it's really a tactical point versus a sort of like philosophical

350
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:01,870
point, but it's something I've noticed a lot. So,

351
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,598
Ruby, go back to Ruby. This is our finale with Ruby. We're going

352
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:09,118
to say goodbye to her in a second. She's starting to feel comfortable, but she's

353
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,242
still writing code slower than other devs and team. How can she be more

354
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:15,726
efficient? So here's

355
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:18,354
this kind of really unusual point. I haven't heard a lot of people talk about

356
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:22,022
it. Write your pseudocode in comments and pseudocode. If those of you

357
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:25,878
who don't know what it is, pseudocode is basically where you write literally words

358
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:29,666
describing your code, it's almost like someone had to translate the logic you're

359
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:32,906
putting in your code as sentences, like the way you would talk

360
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:36,826
about the code if you had to explain it in words. So it

361
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:40,490
could be literally what you're seeing on the screen, your pseudocode.

362
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,926
So if you write that first because you're thinking through

363
00:21:44,948 --> 00:21:48,094
the business logic, then be like, okay, I think that makes sense.

364
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:51,758
Now just translate it into the syntax of whatever programming language you're in. You're kind

365
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:54,770
of separating those two threads. And the reason this is effective is

366
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,550
if you're new, it's very likely that the programming

367
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,234
language syntax is not second nature to you. I don't really think

368
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:06,818
about syntax much at this point. Personally. Whenever I'm writing Ruby or

369
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:10,486
Javascript, like the languages that I'm most familiar with, I'm really thinking about the

370
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:13,446
logic. But if you're new, you're actually spending a lot of those extra cycles being

371
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:16,534
like, oh wait, where does the closing parentheses go?

372
00:22:16,572 --> 00:22:19,706
That kind of thing. So if you can separate those tasks out, it'll actually make

373
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:23,322
you more productive because it becomes two

374
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,770
simpler tasks instead of one more complex task.

375
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,038
So the point here is, syntax sucks. Senior devs

376
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:33,434
have been writing code for so long, the syntax of code is second nature

377
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,474
to them. If you're not there yet, separate the process of thinking about the logic

378
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:40,030
and writing the syntax of the programming language as separate,

379
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,590
and that's it. That is the presentation.

380
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,130
For those of you that don't know, gravity exists on earth.

381
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,310
I love Neil degrasse Tyson.

382
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,974
And yeah, just going back to my contact information mission, if you

383
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:59,174
really are interested in some of the stuff I have to say,

384
00:22:59,372 --> 00:23:02,550
there's other talks and podcasts and other things that I put online,

385
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,538
things, some of the things I've written. You can find it all at Riazv,

386
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,866
me and I occasionally, but not very often, will tweet.

387
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:12,902
Riaz. Virani. Riaz, thank you for joining me and enjoy

388
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:13,330
your conference.
