00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,226
Hi everybody. Thank you very much for being here. The title

2
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:43,970
of my talk is security chaos engineering with some considerations

3
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,998
for game days when the experiments are cyberattacks now.

4
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:53,642
Nice to meet you. I am Judy Nino. I work as site reliability

5
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:57,166
engineer in Adl Digital Labs, a company in

6
00:00:57,188 --> 00:01:01,214
Colombia that provides technology and innovation services for a banking group.

7
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:05,186
Also, I am chaos engineering advocate between a spanish community.

8
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:08,814
Lastly, I am from Garagoa. Garagoa is a beautiful town

9
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:10,370
located in Colombia.

10
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,246
Although I've never been in Japan, when I seen in

11
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:20,354
resilience, Japanese immediately come to my mind regularly.

12
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:23,346
Palmat by Nashville and may made by disasters.

13
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,646
Japanese always recovered from adversity. In the

14
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:30,714
last 100 years, Japan has faced tragedies such as

15
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:34,966
the great Kanto equipment in 1923, two nuclear

16
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:38,506
bombs over Iroshima, Nagasaki in 1945

17
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:42,346
and a tsunami in the Toku in 2011.

18
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:46,110
These adversities have proved a culture based on resilience.

19
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,546
People say that is a consequence of discipline.

20
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:55,086
Positive, polite and resilient culture. Culture inspired

21
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,254
by example by samurai. Samurai cultivated

22
00:01:58,302 --> 00:02:01,826
the bujido cause of martial bertuts, indifference to

23
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:05,510
pain and loyalty, engaging in many battles during

24
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,282
twelveth century. Here are the most famous cyber

25
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:13,218
rides in the history. My apologies for my pronunciation

26
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:16,706
here. Minamoto Miyamoto Tojo

27
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:22,922
Tomi Honda Antakera if

28
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,966
I have to choose one, I would say my favorite is Miyamoto

29
00:02:26,998 --> 00:02:31,130
Musaji. Has sisting allowed to him improvising

30
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,146
with absolute efficiency in any situation of apparel.

31
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:38,686
Not without first reflecting on all variables he

32
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,362
faced. For Musaji, there is no better weapon

33
00:02:42,426 --> 00:02:46,202
than any other. It is important for the warrior to evaluate

34
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:50,238
which is the most according to the circumstances.

35
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:53,502
Towards the end of his life, he's dedicated

36
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:57,478
his time to study and teaching. He wrote the book of five

37
00:02:57,564 --> 00:03:00,950
Rings, an essential resource for martial arts.

38
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,686
Probably you are asking why I am speaking about Japanese and

39
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:11,242
samurai in an aesthetic conference. The reason is that

40
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,822
if we want to face security cyber attacks,

41
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,446
we should develop skills such as discipline,

42
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:21,690
precision, attention to details and the resilience. Like Japanese

43
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,294
inspired in the Miyamoto's story, I have designed this

44
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:28,830
agenda for address security chaos engineering. We are talking

45
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,650
about some of the famous cyber attacks, how to use incident

46
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,286
management theories. To mitigate this, I am going to introduce

47
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,286
a novel discipline known chaos engineering and security chaos engineering.

48
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:44,002
With this context, I am going to talk about security Chaos game days.

49
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:47,982
That is the main topic. I am going to present a framework that we develop

50
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:50,966
to design and practice security chaos game days.

51
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:54,822
And finally, I am going to share some

52
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:57,430
learnings and challenge on this chart.

53
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,634
Recently, I read on Twitter. Cyber war is

54
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:06,374
everywhere, in the media, in the military, among politicians

55
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:09,834
and in academia. Although I think that is a

56
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:13,260
personal it is not a cyber war.

57
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,094
Cyber attacks could be useful for a war that is a fact.

58
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:22,026
But I am going to show how you can use chaos engineering

59
00:04:22,058 --> 00:04:25,550
to mitigate the risk and training engineering teams

60
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,180
to be prepared for a disaster like this.

61
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,206
Cyberattacks can be defined as unanticipated and

62
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:38,854
catastrophic incidents. They happen on production and can take

63
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:42,854
the system down. Cyberattacks are hard to or

64
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:46,994
most likely impossible to predict, have a severe

65
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:50,634
impact on the availability of a sofa system,

66
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:54,598
and may generate multiple hours of downtime.

67
00:04:54,774 --> 00:04:58,438
Some of the famous cyberattacks include nope,

68
00:04:58,534 --> 00:05:02,982
cyberattacks. In 2018, this cyberattacks affected

69
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:06,842
all business units and Mexline. Mex is a famous

70
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,874
shipping company, the Equifax data breach.

71
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:14,834
This happened between May and July 2017

72
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:18,558
and American Credit Bureau Equifax.

73
00:05:18,734 --> 00:05:21,938
In this cyberattack, the credit data of

74
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:25,982
millions of Americans, Canadians and british citizens

75
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:30,162
were compromised and recently the

76
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:34,086
cyberattacks to Twitter. At this moment, Twitter believed that

77
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:38,030
attackers used social engineering

78
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,074
scheme to manipulate a number of employees and

79
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:46,010
use their credentials to access Twitter internal systems.

80
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,654
As you notice, cyberattacks are a reality and

81
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:55,934
they are hard to predict them. However,

82
00:05:56,052 --> 00:06:00,446
we can respond to these issues before

83
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:04,878
they impact our systems and this sense severity

84
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:08,994
and for this case, security incident management could be

85
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:10,580
useful here.

86
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,894
An incident in the context of information technology is

87
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:21,842
an event that is not part of normal

88
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:25,314
operations. Incident management is the practice

89
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:29,062
of recording, triaging, tracking and assigning

90
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:33,370
business value to problems that impact our critical systems.

91
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,098
SIV is an acronym used to refer

92
00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:41,194
to an incident and it is derived of severity.

93
00:06:41,322 --> 00:06:45,310
Some examples for this kind of incidents

94
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,638
include availability drops, product issues,

95
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:53,982
features, broken data losses,

96
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,314
and security risks. Here are some resources from

97
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:01,314
Gremlin Gremlin is a company specializing SRE and

98
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:04,866
chaos engineering and here

99
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:08,742
are more resources about SIP Gremlin has

100
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:12,054
provided a complete guide to analyze the

101
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:15,286
impact of an incident in our sres and

102
00:07:15,308 --> 00:07:19,370
slos. Here, it's very important to consider the level

103
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,254
associated to the incident and finally, they explained

104
00:07:23,302 --> 00:07:25,770
a formula to calculate this impact.

105
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,142
Since security teams have focus on

106
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:36,026
confidentiality and reliability,

107
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:39,834
I asked why in this literature

108
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:43,618
the word security is missed. According to

109
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:47,218
Google, both SRE and security have

110
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:51,374
strong dependencies on classic software engineering

111
00:07:51,422 --> 00:07:55,880
teams. So it is really strange why the

112
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,160
word security is missed here.

113
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,998
So, for example, in this service

114
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:04,870
level agreement document,

115
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,218
it is from a company for which I work in

116
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:14,406
the past. I remember that we include a disclaimer

117
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:18,746
when the incident has related to security, no matter

118
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:22,730
if we are talking about incident levels or environments,

119
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,654
we couldn't commit with times or

120
00:08:26,692 --> 00:08:31,646
solutions. When we are speaking about

121
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:35,566
cyber attacks, the reason has described by Laura

122
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,374
Nolan in his Eucenics presentations. Cyber attacks

123
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:42,994
are black swans, so they

124
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:46,694
are hard to or most likely impossible to

125
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:50,722
predict. They have a severe impact

126
00:08:50,786 --> 00:08:53,958
on the availability of a software system.

127
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:55,080
As I mentioned,

128
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:03,306
according to the third book about SRE and

129
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:06,726
security from Google, security and reliability,

130
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,430
SRE missed in the customer's operations. The reason

131
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,094
is that if the system is working well, the customers

132
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:17,470
don't notice them. However, I believe that

133
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,386
security and reliability should be the top priorities

134
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:24,754
for any organization because there are a lot

135
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:27,890
of common things such as invisibility,

136
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,742
assessment, simplicity, evolution,

137
00:09:31,886 --> 00:09:35,558
resilience, investigations and recovery. They are

138
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:38,920
explained in the chapter one of this book.

139
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,706
So in this sense, I asked to Colton Andrews

140
00:09:44,738 --> 00:09:48,298
about this in a public questions and answer

141
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:53,142
session and my two questions were related

142
00:09:53,206 --> 00:09:56,986
to this. So my questions were

143
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:00,974
are there is a list of common attacks when you are

144
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:04,350
considering experimenting with security on a system?

145
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,190
And my second question was should we have

146
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,914
special considerations when the attacks SRE involved

147
00:10:11,962 --> 00:10:15,780
with security instead of infrastructure. For example,

148
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,706
he answered, reliability is a

149
00:10:20,728 --> 00:10:24,730
core pillar of security testing. An offensive

150
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,994
security tester. Although penetration testing and chaos

151
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:32,258
experiments share some parallels,

152
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:36,274
they have different goals. However, chaos engineering

153
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:40,310
is focused on making systems more reliable

154
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,286
and secure in any situation. If you notice reliability

155
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,810
and security and our

156
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,858
next topic chaos engineering SRE related

157
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:57,134
topics so for me

158
00:10:57,252 --> 00:11:00,718
it is about culture. So we should build

159
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:04,386
a culture based on security and reliability. And in

160
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:07,858
this sense we should train our security teams based

161
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:09,410
on this culture.

162
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,306
According to the last book from Google according

163
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:20,166
to the last book related to Chaos Engineering published on

164
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:23,826
April, a culture based on reliability

165
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:27,726
and for me on security. Our incident response

166
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,930
teams should have these roles,

167
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,878
designer, designer or facilitator,

168
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:38,598
who is the person leading the discussion and commander

169
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:42,406
who is the person executing the comments

170
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:46,254
and scribe and unescribe who

171
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:50,250
takes notes in a communication tool such as slack

172
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,350
on what is occurring in the room, an observer,

173
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,110
this person looks at and sres relevant

174
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,540
graphs with the rest of the group and finally

175
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,146
the correspondent who keeps an eye on slack

176
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:07,000
for example.

177
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,926
Related to security we have some exercise can

178
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:19,898
be useful for training our security teams. Although consider

179
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:24,218
the answer from Colton and Andrews, they are different from

180
00:12:24,304 --> 00:12:28,390
chaos experiments. Red team exercise were originated

181
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:31,566
with the USA armed force and in this

182
00:12:31,588 --> 00:12:35,002
case the adversarial approach that imitates

183
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:39,226
the behaviors and techniques of attackers in the most realistic

184
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,214
way possible. Two common examples include ethical hacking,

185
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,482
penetration and penetration testing. In the other side,

186
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:50,194
blue teams are the defensive counterparts to the red

187
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:51,890
teams in this exercise.

188
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,810
Purple team exercises are an evolution

189
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,920
of red team exercises since

190
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,510
they deliver a more cohesive experience between

191
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,462
the offensive and defensive teams. The goal

192
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:13,194
of this exercise is the collaboration of

193
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:16,586
offensive and defensive tactics to

194
00:13:16,608 --> 00:13:19,878
improve the effectiveness of both

195
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:23,626
groups in the event of an attempted compromise.

196
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:27,626
An orientation is to increase transparency

197
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,080
and allow to learning.

198
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,762
So however, our point here is that

199
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:39,442
penetration testing are not enough and red

200
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:44,062
teams exercise and blue teams exercise

201
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:48,606
are not enough for mitigating attacks such as Nopedia

202
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:52,342
or resin attacks to Twitter. We need a new

203
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,842
approach, one that keep pace

204
00:13:55,906 --> 00:13:59,690
with the evolving world of attacks and of course

205
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,786
software engineering. So it

206
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:07,786
is the moment to introduce a novel technique can be useful for

207
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:12,110
solving this challenges. Chaos engineering

208
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,202
chaos engineering is the discipline of experiments

209
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:19,594
failures in production or on production in order to reveal

210
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:23,710
their weakness and to build confidence in their resilience capability.

211
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,554
This definition was taken from the site of

212
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:32,162
principle of chaos which contains a manifesto for

213
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:37,570
chaos engineering. I have highlined

214
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,774
experiments, production, rebel, build,

215
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:45,078
confidence and resilience because these words are really important

216
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:48,826
in this definition. So here there

217
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:52,806
is a list of the common attacks practiced by engineering

218
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:55,978
teams using chaos engineering. We have a

219
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:59,494
list for technical issues and some examples

220
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:03,802
include dependency failures, region and some failures

221
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:07,550
provided failures for example cloud provided failures,

222
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,322
network upgrades and failures

223
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:14,514
in Iraq for example. And the

224
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:18,354
most important is that cultural issues

225
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:22,194
related to this or allow

226
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:26,514
to these technical issues happen. Some examples

227
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:30,834
includes, for example, lack of chaos engineering or lack

228
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:34,774
of knowledge sharing, for example, lack of on

229
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:39,062
call training. That is a practice described

230
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:42,540
in the blue books in Google for example.

231
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,730
So if you notice in the previous days,

232
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,500
the word security is missed again.

233
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,542
Why? Because this friendly reminder,

234
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:58,074
if security teams have focused on confidentiality

235
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:01,646
and reliability when the issue is a cyber attack,

236
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:05,042
we don't commit with this. We don't commit with

237
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:08,820
times or solutions or

238
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,570
sres, slos or slM.

239
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,866
So what is security chaos engineering? Security chaos engineering

240
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:23,314
is the identification of security control failures draw proactive

241
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:26,870
experimentation to build confidence in the system's ability

242
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,662
to defend against malicious conditions on production.

243
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:34,380
I highlighted six words

244
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,926
that are variable in this definition provided by Aaron in

245
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:44,266
the last book about chaos engineering published in April

246
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:47,338
in this year. Security failures,

247
00:16:47,434 --> 00:16:50,926
experimentation, confidence, defense and

248
00:16:50,948 --> 00:16:54,818
production because they sre super important because

249
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:58,786
this discipline is based on the scientific method and

250
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:02,206
confidence and defense

251
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:05,994
are words related with resilience and reliability.

252
00:17:06,142 --> 00:17:10,310
And of course the experiments should be ruined

253
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,070
on production.

254
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,462
You security chaos engineering

255
00:17:19,526 --> 00:17:22,886
addresses a number of gaps in contemporary

256
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:26,182
security methodologies such as red and purple

257
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:29,702
team exercise. It is really

258
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:33,214
important to have clear it is not the intention to

259
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:37,022
overlook the value of red and purple team exercise or

260
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:41,418
other security testing methods. These techniques remain valuable

261
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:44,990
but differ in terms of goals and techniques.

262
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,394
As Colton Andrews mentioned in his answer,

263
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:53,220
combined with security chaos engineering, they provide

264
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,030
more objective and proactive feedback

265
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,058
mechanisms to prepare a system for adverse

266
00:18:01,154 --> 00:18:04,850
event that when implemented alone

267
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:09,914
for example and let

268
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:12,860
me before to pass to Chaos game days.

269
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,414
Remember to this phrase from Warner

270
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:21,006
Bowels, everything fails all the time. So that

271
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:24,320
is the moment for introduce the Chaos game days.

272
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,614
So chaos game days are

273
00:18:29,652 --> 00:18:34,030
based on game days. A definition from AWS.

274
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,714
For game days they sre an

275
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:40,974
interactive team based learning exercise designed

276
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:44,194
to give players a chance to put their skills to

277
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:48,070
the test in the real world gamified, risk free

278
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,246
environment. So as

279
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:55,814
a form of game days, we have chaos game days.

280
00:18:55,932 --> 00:19:00,090
In this case, it is a practice event that can take

281
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,850
a whole day. It usually require only few hours.

282
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,578
The goal of a game day or a chaos game day

283
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:11,014
is to practice how your team or your supporting

284
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:14,862
system team deal with the real

285
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,142
world turbulence conditions. The difference between them

286
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:21,678
is that the technology and the objective. Finally,

287
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:24,530
because in the case for AWS,

288
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,502
we sre experimenting with AWS

289
00:19:29,566 --> 00:19:33,554
technologies. So in this case for Chaos game days,

290
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,954
we sre experimenting with our system, with our technologies

291
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:41,560
and trying to mitigate real

292
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,714
turbulent conditions as Rosemail

293
00:19:45,762 --> 00:19:49,786
mentioned in this book. So in

294
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:54,698
this framework provided by Ruth Meyers in

295
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:57,850
the previous book, Sorry Learning Chaos Engineering,

296
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,446
the framework has three phases, before,

297
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:06,766
during and after. During the before during the before

298
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:10,282
stage we should focus on pick a hypothesis,

299
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:13,870
pick a style, decide who, decide where,

300
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:17,586
decide when, document and get approval. That is really important.

301
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:21,682
And this phase is very expensive because

302
00:20:21,736 --> 00:20:25,286
we have to plan a lot

303
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:29,640
of things. So the second has is during.

304
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,154
In this phase, the idea is to run the exercises,

305
00:20:33,202 --> 00:20:37,234
validate or refute the hypothesis

306
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:42,042
using observability tools and our skills for solving issues.

307
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:45,514
In this phase, the engineers for example detection the

308
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:49,226
situation, communicate, visit that board,

309
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:52,030
analyze data, propose solutions.

310
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,814
In this case, we are trying to apply this

311
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:03,298
framework with these activities. So finally,

312
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:06,706
in the last part, the last part is for writing the

313
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:09,570
postmortem with these parts,

314
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,526
what happens, impact, duration,

315
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,610
resolution, time resolution,

316
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,790
timeline and action items. And although

317
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,574
there are several templates for

318
00:21:23,612 --> 00:21:24,870
this in the literature,

319
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,270
before to pass to our framework

320
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,820
our focus for security. I would like to share

321
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,478
this phrase from Vincom.

322
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:43,086
Human factors in cybersecurity are perhaps the

323
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:47,114
biggest challenge when building an effective threat prevention

324
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:48,030
strategy.

325
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,030
So considering the previous framework provided by Rusmiles

326
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,074
and the context. If you remember the security word is

327
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:05,330
missed in the literature in the list of attacks

328
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,166
in the exercise. I would like to share a framework that we

329
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:13,926
are using to practice security chaos engineering in our

330
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:17,766
study group in ADL and study group related

331
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:21,002
to chaos engineering. So this

332
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:25,834
framework. In our framework we consider the

333
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:29,526
three phases such as Rusma is described

334
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:33,454
in his book, but we are including a new

335
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:37,370
stage for evolve or for evolution.

336
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,422
So in this case we are dedicated time after each

337
00:22:41,476 --> 00:22:45,086
game day to improve vulnerability database,

338
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:49,122
refine the process, adjust metrics, validate the

339
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:52,722
chaos maturity position after the exercise and

340
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:56,998
adapt the new game day because it

341
00:22:57,004 --> 00:23:01,122
is really important to use the feedback

342
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:04,486
generated in a previous Chaos game day.

343
00:23:04,668 --> 00:23:07,946
In this case security chaos game day in order to

344
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:14,394
improve the sorry.

345
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:18,646
Also we have to consider some things in the phases provided

346
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:22,046
by Rosemary, so also to

347
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:25,070
include a new has or a new stage.

348
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,574
We are providing some considerations for the

349
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:34,740
three classical stages. So in this case,

350
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,294
our recommendation better. Our consideration

351
00:23:41,342 --> 00:23:45,070
better is when you are picking the hypothesis. It's really important

352
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,598
to understand the adversary because the

353
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:52,166
motivations, profiles and methods are super important

354
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:57,254
here. Remember, the human factors are a

355
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:00,538
main considerations when you are trying to provide

356
00:24:00,624 --> 00:24:03,946
experiments related to security. And in

357
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:07,642
a second one decide or pick

358
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,740
the style. In this case,

359
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,302
if you are going to choose a style, choose one.

360
00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:18,394
With adversaries. It is preferred over the classical mode

361
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:21,982
in which we had a master of disaster who attacked the system.

362
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:26,194
The idea in this case is to take inspiration from the red and

363
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:31,058
blue teams exercise, but using different

364
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:34,958
teams attacking between them. So finally

365
00:24:35,064 --> 00:24:38,146
reconsider the roles. If you remember, we reviewed

366
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:41,686
the roles described in

367
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:45,990
the Chaos engineering in the last Chaos engineering book published

368
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,026
in April. Sorry, but consider

369
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:54,010
for example if you need a consultant or an expert

370
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,174
with knowledge of the last attacks

371
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:03,934
provided by attackers in the market. So they

372
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:08,974
are our consideration for this phase. So if

373
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:12,190
you want to practice an exercise,

374
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,180
this book, building secure and reliable system that

375
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,774
we use in a previous slide provides some examples

376
00:25:21,822 --> 00:25:26,374
for attacks in order to

377
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:30,502
practice with security in a chaos experiment. For example, in this case they

378
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:34,070
are describing an attack in which

379
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,134
attacker use a search engine to find the email address

380
00:25:38,252 --> 00:25:41,638
of employees at an attacker organization.

381
00:25:41,814 --> 00:25:45,818
Attacker send phishing emails to employees so

382
00:25:45,904 --> 00:25:50,398
attacker remotely go logs or remote access

383
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:54,110
to the system using these credentials.

384
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,022
So in this case during

385
00:26:01,076 --> 00:26:04,386
the exercise, some examples that we are trying to

386
00:26:04,408 --> 00:26:08,270
practice in our study group introduce RNC

387
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,690
on security controls for example. That is a classic

388
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,022
example for these experiments group

389
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:21,202
folder like a script in production software

390
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:24,934
secret clear text disclosure permission collision in

391
00:26:24,972 --> 00:26:28,458
a share AI policy.

392
00:26:28,624 --> 00:26:32,154
So disable service event login. That is really

393
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:36,886
critical. AP gateway shutdown and XSI

394
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:40,526
related with s three buckets. For example, if you are

395
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:43,866
using a technology such as AWS

396
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,470
or disable multifactor authenticator.

397
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:53,162
So it is an example of a mental experiment

398
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:57,390
using security case engineering. In this case, our hypothesis

399
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,342
was after the owner of root accounting AWS

400
00:27:01,406 --> 00:27:04,906
left the company, we could use our cloud in a normal

401
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:09,334
way. So we were thinking about this in

402
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:13,362
an experiment and the result was hypothesis disproved

403
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:16,994
because in this experiment the access to AWS was connected

404
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:20,774
with the active directory. So when an employee

405
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:24,522
left the company, his account is dropped and we lost the access

406
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,830
to AWS. So that is really critical.

407
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,520
And in this case we are trying to

408
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,162
practice a mental exercise. But if you notice

409
00:27:35,306 --> 00:27:39,150
we have the opportunity to identify vulnerabilities

410
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:44,930
and controls we should review

411
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,094
in order to guarantee

412
00:27:48,142 --> 00:27:51,902
that our system is secure on production. So aside,

413
00:27:51,966 --> 00:27:55,354
effect of this experiments thinking in this scenario

414
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:59,186
allows to consider another applications connected

415
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:01,030
to active directory.

416
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,600
Finally,

417
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,386
in the third phase, it is really important to consider

418
00:28:11,488 --> 00:28:15,594
that security postmortem should

419
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:19,814
be different of classic postmortem

420
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:23,290
because they should cover technology issues

421
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,002
that the attacker exploits and also recognize opportunities

422
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:31,354
to improve incident handling. That is the reason for including

423
00:28:31,402 --> 00:28:35,054
a four stage, for example, document the time frames and effort

424
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:39,202
associated to these action items and decide which

425
00:28:39,256 --> 00:28:42,100
actions items we consider.

426
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,322
So finally, in this last phase,

427
00:28:48,386 --> 00:28:51,814
introducing our framework, I would like to focus on

428
00:28:51,852 --> 00:28:55,842
continuous verification because remember, it is a continuous

429
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:59,366
process in which we should use the previous feedback

430
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:03,466
in order to improve the next game day. So according to

431
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:06,858
Erica, Erica is a company specialized on

432
00:29:07,024 --> 00:29:11,550
security case engineering continuous verification encourage both

433
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,322
of these requirements in a way that proactively educates

434
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:19,322
engineers about the systems they operate is emerging.

435
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:23,490
Has crucial practice for navigating complex software systems,

436
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,010
one definition more provided by them.

437
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,734
Continuous verification is a game changer for complex

438
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:34,878
software system management and

439
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:38,806
complex attacks such as security attacks. In the future,

440
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:43,538
it will fundamentally change the scale and types of systems

441
00:29:43,634 --> 00:29:46,280
that we even consider building.

442
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,014
So lastly, I would like to share some learnings and challenge

443
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:56,714
after trying to practice security kos game days

444
00:29:56,832 --> 00:30:00,830
because remember, it is a fact that the future only can

445
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,862
be improved if something is learned from the past.

446
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:09,498
So this definition was provided by David woods

447
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,920
in the resilience engineering book.

448
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,578
So our learnings include the adoption of security

449
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:22,834
chaos engineering faces challenge in

450
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:26,454
this adoption human factors and consider the view

451
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:30,134
of an attacker is very very important in order to

452
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:33,714
provide the proper experiments and the proper hypothesis

453
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:37,282
in an experiments. So reducing potential

454
00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:41,770
damage and blast radius is super important in security.

455
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,786
It is important in a common

456
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:49,354
chaos experiment, but the insecurity is important too.

457
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:53,614
Communication or better skills related to communication and

458
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:57,162
observability can guarantee the success of an experiment.

459
00:30:57,226 --> 00:31:00,302
So it is really important to

460
00:31:00,356 --> 00:31:04,318
have the proper skills for communication and observability

461
00:31:04,494 --> 00:31:08,606
and to use tools such as data doc

462
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:11,938
or neuralic for this. And requirements can

463
00:31:12,024 --> 00:31:15,254
make collision with experimentation in security. So it is

464
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:18,790
really important that consider that our requirements

465
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,174
are aligned with

466
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:26,726
the experimentation in this case. So finally, you don't need

467
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:30,426
to be an expert and security expert in

468
00:31:30,448 --> 00:31:34,342
order to start with security chaos engineering. My favorite

469
00:31:34,406 --> 00:31:38,394
phrase here is that just start with the

470
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:42,382
experiments that probably in the past you will

471
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:46,718
have the opportunity to learn the side things that you need

472
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,530
for practicing this discipline.

473
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,974
So they

474
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:56,954
are the least challenge that we identify it

475
00:31:57,012 --> 00:32:00,642
after trying to apply to

476
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:04,674
this framework in our group of

477
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:08,166
stories. So the adoption of security

478
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,986
chaos engineering principles across organizations reminds

479
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:15,414
us an open challenge. It is our mission to

480
00:32:15,452 --> 00:32:18,922
provide more investigation, more techniques and other

481
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:23,478
frameworks that can be useful

482
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:27,558
for trying to mitigate cyberattacks.

483
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,930
So as I mentioned, security is missed in several resources

484
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,534
for chaos engineering, in this case for

485
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:39,374
chaos maturity model. It is not an exception. So security

486
00:32:39,572 --> 00:32:44,262
may be included in this chaos maturity model, since combining

487
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:48,210
chaos maturity model and security chaos game days help

488
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,014
new custom newcomers to start their chaos engineering

489
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:55,554
efforts and allow to build resilience

490
00:32:55,602 --> 00:32:59,922
and security. And finally, it is a challenge

491
00:33:00,066 --> 00:33:03,430
for us. It is an exciting time to be working

492
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,246
on this space. So we

493
00:33:08,268 --> 00:33:11,270
are in a moment to try with the experiments.

494
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,490
So now I would like to share a

495
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:20,310
phrase from Arun is an expert

496
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,346
in security case engineering and he says that humans

497
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:27,934
operate differently when they expect

498
00:33:28,052 --> 00:33:31,438
things to fail. So it's really important to consider

499
00:33:31,524 --> 00:33:35,074
human factor when you are trying to experiment with

500
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:37,010
security in your systems.

501
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,714
So now finally, here are

502
00:33:41,752 --> 00:33:46,018
some books can be useful if you want to start with security chaos engineering.

503
00:33:46,114 --> 00:33:49,122
They provide the fundamentals to chaos engineering.

504
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:52,518
Chaos experiments, scientific method. For example,

505
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:56,566
this book by Ruth Meyers. It is a

506
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,562
really good source if you want to study the scientific

507
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:04,406
method. And the last book provided by Nora

508
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:08,486
Jones and Cassie Rosental. In this case, this book provides

509
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:12,186
a chapter dedicated to security chaos engineering.

510
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:15,886
So the idea is to

511
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:19,262
consider that security should

512
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:23,934
be present in our definitions, in our experiments

513
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:26,050
related to chaos engineering.

514
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,802
So now, and to close two phrases that

515
00:34:30,856 --> 00:34:35,298
I consider proper here. Don't fear failure in

516
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:38,946
gate attempts. It is glorious even to fail.

517
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:43,042
And one single vulnerability is all an attacker

518
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:46,902
needs. So thank you. Thank you very much

519
00:34:46,956 --> 00:34:49,080
for attending this talk.

520
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:54,838
I would like to share my contact data and

521
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:58,530
my username is Yury Nino in LinkedIn medium,

522
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:01,790
Twitter and in another

523
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,690
show. Thank you. Thank you very much for attending.
