1
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,886
Quantum machine learning is a research area that explores these

2
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:30,438
interplay of ideas from quantum computing and machine learning.

3
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:34,034
As you know, machine learning revolves around algorithms, model complexity

4
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:37,554
and computational complexity. Whereas quantum computers offers

5
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:41,986
parallel processing capabilities which are essential to build efficient

6
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,858
machine learning solutions, quantum phenomena such as superposition

7
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:49,154
and entanglement are helping the industry to build efficient

8
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:53,034
machine learning algorithms. Applications of QML QML

9
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:56,282
is becoming a base building block for many scientific

10
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:59,870
solutions on built on quantum computing.

11
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,446
The classification we can use for classifying nanoparticles

12
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,820
subatomic scale because here the data itself available in quantum information,

13
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,646
not a classical data and molecular modeling for drug

14
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:17,874
discovery and prediction, weather forecasting, geometrical differences

15
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:21,826
in recommendation space exploration, large language

16
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:25,190
systems like chat GBT. So when you hear

17
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,834
the quantum applications, you may wonder what are the techniques

18
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:32,746
offered by quantum machine learning these

19
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:36,550
days it is very fancy to prefix the word quantum in front of any technique

20
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,074
or any tool. So that's what first we look like when

21
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:44,346
there is a support vector machine, quantum support vector machine neural network quantum

22
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:48,142
neural network. But QML has their own approaches also like

23
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:51,946
quantum binary classifier and even the grower search algorithm

24
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:55,458
is one of the fundamental technique for most of

25
00:01:55,464 --> 00:01:58,526
the quantum machine learning solutions. Quantum enhanced

26
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:02,334
reinforcement learning, quantum sampling techniques, quantum neural network,

27
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:05,778
quantum convolution neural network dissipative quantum

28
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:06,870
neural network,

29
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,554
hidden quantum oracle models,

30
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:15,094
explainable quantum machine learning quantum transfer learning and these

31
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:18,514
quantum generative adversary networks then fuzzy cognitive

32
00:02:18,562 --> 00:02:22,460
mass FCM. These are all various techniques used for

33
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,906
QML based solutions. What are the

34
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:30,906
platforms or software tools available to build QML

35
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:34,510
systems? IBM Kiskit is one of the prominent

36
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,810
quantum computing framework. Kiskit has QML

37
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,850
libraries to build quantum support vector mission

38
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,430
nearest neighborhood neural network

39
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,350
and there are some special functions like ZZ feature map

40
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,498
and those Kiskit based

41
00:02:56,584 --> 00:03:00,820
libraries are helping to build a

42
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,110
counterpart for their classical machine learning models.

43
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:10,082
And Xanado is having a special package

44
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:14,154
called Pennylan. Pennylan is can again Python package which can

45
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:17,626
be imported and installed in your Python environment. These connect it to

46
00:03:17,648 --> 00:03:21,242
the various quantum computers and Pennyland

47
00:03:21,306 --> 00:03:25,326
has more QML specific

48
00:03:25,428 --> 00:03:29,550
functionalities functions libraries

49
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,790
to implement your quantum machine learning solutions.

50
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,522
And if you are from Tensorflow based classical machine learning

51
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:40,926
solutions, you can use Google's Tensorflow

52
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,222
quantum for building Tensorflow

53
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:47,986
quantum based QML solutions. Dwayve has their machine

54
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:52,626
learning libraries and then PYQL. They are offering grower

55
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:56,374
search based QML solutions. Apart from these

56
00:03:56,412 --> 00:04:01,510
things there may be more framework

57
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,340
or software tools which I may not aware. If anyone knows, please share.

58
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,600
It is growing every day new libraries are coming. There may be many

59
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,686
advancements in the QML so you

60
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,854
might have found better QML solutions. Also. If there is,

61
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,662
please even I think qsharp is also having a QML

62
00:04:23,726 --> 00:04:27,298
package and bracket. So almost

63
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:31,294
all quantum computing platforms have their QML

64
00:04:31,422 --> 00:04:35,646
capabilities. You hear QML

65
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:39,814
is not the new technology. Even the research theoretical researches started 1995

66
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:43,874
itself. There is a biological inspired QML

67
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:47,334
work by CAN 1995, but in 2009

68
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:50,662
d wave demonstrated a QML capability to predict

69
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:54,730
cars in the digital image processing. In 2013

70
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,638
Google and NASA jointly started

71
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:03,694
quantum artificial lab. Then 2014 all

72
00:05:03,732 --> 00:05:06,000
optical fiber classifier was built,

73
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,354
a perceptor model was built. Then powertrain

74
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:15,150
modeling and optimization of dual motor driving

75
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,054
systems for electric vehicle that also build in 2014,

76
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:23,714
2015 to 2018 multiple use

77
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:27,922
cases enhancements happened like train their probabilistic

78
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:31,942
generative models with arbitrary and

79
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:36,114
pairwise connectivity for handwritten image generation.

80
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:39,446
Traffic flow optimization using quantum annealer which

81
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:44,042
is then in 2019 2021

82
00:05:44,096 --> 00:05:47,740
there are experimental demonstration of quantum speed up of

83
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,898
learning time of the reinforcement learning. Then quantum neuron

84
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:55,502
was built, even tensorflow quantum was released since

85
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,750
2022 multiple chain.

86
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,726
This timeline is not exhaustive. There are a lot

87
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:07,066
of new researchers,

88
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:10,622
papers are published and if you see the number

89
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:14,610
of papers published on QML, it is an exponential cow. The last

90
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,182
four years we have seen thousand 200

91
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:22,434
peppers per annum. So that is the growth

92
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:27,240
of QML. So QML is promising more

93
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,934
powerful and then efficient algorithms to

94
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:36,274
build quantum

95
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:39,834
systems which are utilizing these QML capabilities.

96
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:40,960
Thank you.

97
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,810
Thank you.
