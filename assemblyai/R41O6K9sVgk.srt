00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,738
Welcome everyone to our presentation on AI integration for developers

2
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,178
with a focus on chat, GPT and copilot. I'm Mihaelaroxana

3
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:49,918
Ghidersa and I'm excited to discuss with you today some of the ways we

4
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:52,590
can use AI in our everyday tasks.

5
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,666
A little bit about myself. I'm a software engineer.

6
00:00:56,778 --> 00:01:00,174
Right now I have the role of a technical lead at

7
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:03,780
Signet Health. Whenever I find that I have something

8
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,242
interesting to say, or maybe if I learn something new

9
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:12,100
that I find that it would be useful for other developers to

10
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,280
use too. I prepare presentations like

11
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,534
this one today in order to share

12
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:24,914
the knowledge that I have and also learn from other developers.

13
00:01:25,042 --> 00:01:28,546
So I'd like to take thanks to the organizers for having

14
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,438
me and giving me the opportunity to do something that I like. When I'm

15
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:35,594
not doing technical tasks of any

16
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,334
kind, I like to just go in nature and lose

17
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,600
myself in that area.

18
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,566
So about today we are going to

19
00:01:49,668 --> 00:01:53,658
delve into how artificial intelligence, particularly with

20
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:57,266
a focus on chat, GPT and copilot, are transforming the

21
00:01:57,288 --> 00:02:00,786
way we do software development nowadays. This is

22
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:04,158
a huge subject that needs days to be discussed.

23
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:07,654
Therefore, in these sessions we are going to just dive the surface by

24
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:11,282
looking at how these tools precisely can help developers

25
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:14,854
into their day to day work. We are going to discuss how they

26
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:17,994
can be integrated in your development workflow and how

27
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:22,534
they can enhance your productivity. And why not also help you innovate

28
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:24,220
in the work that you are doing.

29
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,254
Putting a bit of context, if we

30
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:34,286
think on a general level in

31
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:37,066
today's software development landscape, AI,

32
00:02:37,178 --> 00:02:40,222
it's just not only a tool,

33
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:44,014
it's an essential component, that it's reshaping our industry.

34
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:47,314
And when we are talking about reshaping our industry, we can

35
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:51,022
think both in a promising

36
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:54,946
way, but also in the way that we are changing the

37
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,694
way we look at our jobs and the way we look at how

38
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:02,534
things are happening and how our

39
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:06,102
day to day work is being transformed by all of this.

40
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:10,474
I'm talking from tools that help us a lot to the

41
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:14,940
fear of losing your job and having an AI that it's so much more

42
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,610
faster and that is going to take our jobs and

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,050
they are going to replace us. And that AI,

44
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,734
it's flawless and has

45
00:03:26,772 --> 00:03:30,350
no issues. So all of these ways

46
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,534
of looking at this evolution and yeah,

47
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:37,618
this is also reshaping the way we are thinking about ourselves and

48
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:41,122
our development. Okay, maybe I should try to learn

49
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:44,100
about this tool instead of being scared of it.

50
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,458
So AI streamlines developers processes by automating

51
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:53,222
some repetitive tasks such as code generation, such as

52
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:56,662
testing, and by doing

53
00:03:56,716 --> 00:04:00,938
this, accelerates project timelines and minimizes human

54
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:04,714
error. It's not perfect, and we are going to discuss about it and

55
00:04:04,752 --> 00:04:08,074
how we can strive for perfection, let's say,

56
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:12,266
or for the best version, while interacting

57
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:15,582
with this tool. But it's not

58
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:19,754
perfect. At the same time, AI's advanced

59
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:23,970
algorithms excel at problem solving and data analysis.

60
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,542
They enable us to create sophisticated

61
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:31,010
and adapted software solutions.

62
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,650
We see AI making our work smarter and more efficient,

63
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,314
and creating all sorts of tools that are showing

64
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:43,286
us the way to this transformation that

65
00:04:43,308 --> 00:04:45,080
we were discussing before.

66
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,420
So basically, if it is to think

67
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,718
in some simple words, is that the role of AI

68
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:59,318
in modern development? It's to transform

69
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:03,818
things, it's to bring evolution. So AI

70
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:07,614
significantly impacts various aspects of software and technology

71
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:11,018
development. And this includes promises,

72
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:14,242
efficiencies, efficiency. AI does

73
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:17,460
some repetitive tasks and

74
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,554
is helping in this way developers to focus more on

75
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:25,118
creative and more complex work. Then AI

76
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:29,334
is helping us reduce mistake, the mistake that we are doing

77
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,670
in our day to day work, just the human error

78
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,270
making software more reliable.

79
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,794
Also, the algorithms that AI is

80
00:05:42,832 --> 00:05:46,298
using are great at solving problems and

81
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:49,900
determining some patterns in our data.

82
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,720
AI, it's not just this

83
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,760
image of a robot that is just talking very

84
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,994
mechanically, but is

85
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:09,170
evolving a lot to learn from

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,326
human interaction and fulfill very specific needs. It becomes

87
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:17,286
very personal, the interaction, it becomes very personal. It doesn't feel like you are

88
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:21,766
talking to a robot, it feels like you're just talking to a

89
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:25,480
colleague, exchanging ideas and getting

90
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,920
some information.

91
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,306
With the help of AI, we can drive innovation in tech

92
00:06:33,488 --> 00:06:37,158
with things like machine learning and all sorts

93
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:40,606
of apps and services that

94
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,760
are bringing big changes in this field.

95
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,774
And the area where we are going

96
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:51,454
to be focused today is the

97
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:55,662
one where AI is giving us very good developers,

98
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:59,778
tools like GitHub and Copilot that

99
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:03,998
offer real time help to developers making work more efficient.

100
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:07,666
And that feels just like you're

101
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:11,480
collaborating with someone. It's not just feeling that

102
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,806
you are working alone. So let's see a

103
00:07:16,828 --> 00:07:19,980
bit, discuss a bit about each of them.

104
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,894
Chat GPT it's an advanced AI language

105
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:28,214
model developed by OpenAI. It uses

106
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:32,174
natural language processing techniques to help

107
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:37,322
us understand and generate

108
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:41,034
humanlike text. This ability to interpret

109
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:44,122
complex queries and provide detailed, relevant,

110
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:48,014
context shaped responses makes it uninvaluable

111
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:51,630
tools for developers. But it's not only for developers.

112
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,200
You can get answers from a wide range of

113
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,190
subjects,

114
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,306
situations, domains and so on. So let's

115
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:08,126
explore some of the, let's say, top features that make Chat GPT

116
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:09,210
so powerful.

117
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,302
First would be the fact that it comprehends and produces text that resembles

118
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:18,730
human communication. It's enabling us to

119
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,906
engage in conversations and create a very natural

120
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:26,350
feeling around the conversations that we are having with Chat GPT,

121
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,680
creating very high quality text contact.

122
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,238
Then it demonstrates a strong understanding

123
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,858
of context in conversations. It can give

124
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:41,550
answers, recalling previous parts of conversation,

125
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,606
enhancing the user experience for the one that

126
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,120
is working with it.

127
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,506
It's doing a lot of tasks, from generating code, to assisting

128
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:57,590
in debugging, to creating engaging stories

129
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,090
to answering complex queries.

130
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:06,214
It brings a lot of values in a lot of professional and creative

131
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:09,994
contexts. For us developers, very important,

132
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:14,394
of course, is the fact that it can understand and generate code snippets in multiple

133
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:17,898
programming languages, which makes it very helpful

134
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:22,126
for us to seek assistance in our day

135
00:09:22,148 --> 00:09:26,130
to day work. Explanations for certain

136
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,442
contexts, learning new things, getting answers to

137
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:33,602
things that maybe we forgot about or we never knew. So is like

138
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,206
having a colleague that you are doing pair programming with and

139
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:41,414
you are discussing and trying

140
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:44,838
to understand the context and trying to find solutions to

141
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:48,326
some problem. And last but not least is

142
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:52,780
the fact that being able to shape responses based on user input and

143
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,140
the feedback that we are giving him,

144
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,914
it allows Chat GPT to adapt to a wide

145
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:06,234
range of styles and tones and user

146
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:10,942
needs, which makes it easy

147
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:14,526
to use in a large range

148
00:10:14,558 --> 00:10:17,410
of use cases.

149
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,342
Personally, I use this tool beyond coding,

150
00:10:21,406 --> 00:10:24,098
from creating a vacation plan,

151
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:27,362
to seeing exactly what I can visit in certain areas and

152
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:31,400
actually asking it to do it for each day,

153
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,046
to helping me create an email in

154
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:39,034
order to give feedback to someone

155
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:43,370
or just trying to get the right tone

156
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,146
in a certain situation. So for me at

157
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,770
least, chat GBT, it's a great assistant.

158
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,206
Then we go to copilot. That on the other side is more

159
00:10:54,228 --> 00:10:57,694
focused on the coded part. I'm using it

160
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:00,430
to play in visual studio.

161
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,654
The cool thing about it is that it was trained on a vast

162
00:11:04,702 --> 00:11:06,180
array of source code.

163
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,142
This makes it able to understand and predict coding patterns

164
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:15,890
and requirements from a wide range.

165
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,214
What it does behind the scene is analyzing the context of your

166
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:24,354
existing code and comments, and based on that it offers code suggestions

167
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:28,746
and solutions in real time. So some

168
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:32,234
of the features to mention, although I'm sure that you might have a lot of

169
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:36,342
other situations

170
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:40,054
where you used it in your day to day work, and I'm open

171
00:11:40,112 --> 00:11:44,526
and happy to learn from you. But some of the

172
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:48,974
features worth mentioning are the fact that it

173
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:52,686
understands the context of your code and it provides suggestions to

174
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,190
complete lines or functions and is

175
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,666
easily adapting to your style and needs. So basically, if you correct it at some

176
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:03,282
point and you are like okay, no, I'm using this kind of property or doing

177
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:06,998
things this way is going to work with you.

178
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:10,646
And next time the answers that you are going to

179
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:14,120
get or the suggestions that you are going to get are more specific,

180
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,922
then has a wide range support for

181
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:21,370
diverse languages and frameworks.

182
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,942
Next, it suggests improvements for logic

183
00:12:28,006 --> 00:12:31,866
and code readability, aiding in efficient

184
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:34,110
and maintainable code development.

185
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,862
On another note, is a great learning and exploration tool because

186
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:42,446
it's very interactive. It's not

187
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:46,626
only for juniors, although I understand that these kind of tools are being

188
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,546
regarded more like a help for juniors that don't have all

189
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:54,146
the bases, so they need someone that it's more experimented to give

190
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:57,874
them suggestions. I personally don't feel this way because it's

191
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:01,640
offering all sort of insights into coding patterns and

192
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,450
best practices and builds on the complexity alongside

193
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,762
with the development of

194
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:14,486
our code. So I think that it's a useful

195
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:18,826
tool for everyone. And you

196
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:22,634
maybe have noticed that for both chat, GPT and copilot,

197
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:26,238
we are discussing a lot about user input and

198
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:30,638
the fact that it interprets human language. Well, as amazing

199
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:33,658
as these tools might be, they don't read minds.

200
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:37,186
We have to learn how to talk to them, we have to learn how

201
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:40,994
to ask things from them, just as we need to do it

202
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:44,910
also with the people around us. So it's about

203
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,598
learning how to communicate in order to

204
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:52,550
get the best results. And this communication

205
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,854
with AI tools is called prompting. So as the deal

206
00:13:56,892 --> 00:14:00,410
with prompting is the process of interacting with an AI tool

207
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,754
by giving it some inputs that are also

208
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:07,370
called commands in order to get a specific response.

209
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,866
This process can be very different depending

210
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:15,166
on the AI tool that you are using.

211
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:18,954
But there are some general directions,

212
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:22,990
let's say, that we can use in any context,

213
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,554
even with people. I was just thinking when I

214
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:32,450
first started learning about this, the fact that learning

215
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,766
how to prompt is going to help us

216
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:40,226
a lot in learning how to communicate with people because we have the patience

217
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:44,022
to shape some very

218
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:47,846
specific questions in order to get the desired answer

219
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:52,682
from an AI tool. But we are so

220
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:55,994
impatient with the people around us and we are

221
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:59,258
always wondering like why don't you understand what I'm trying to say? Like I was

222
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:02,238
so explicit, do I have to over explain it to you?

223
00:15:02,404 --> 00:15:06,080
And maybe we are going to learn something also about

224
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,138
human communication, human to human communication.

225
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:13,906
So going back to

226
00:15:13,928 --> 00:15:17,906
the things that we need to take care of is

227
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:21,214
clear instructions, use clear and precise

228
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:24,642
commands so that Di understands what you really

229
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:28,614
want, provide specific details or criteria to

230
00:15:28,652 --> 00:15:33,110
consider so that you get a specific response

231
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,140
shaped on your needs. Then it's important to know

232
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,250
what the AI tool is capable of doing. For example,

233
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,246
some AI tools are designed for generating text, others for creating

234
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,926
images, and some for processing and

235
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:53,806
analyzing data. You have to understand exactly what you

236
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,054
need from that tool and to see if it's precisely the tool

237
00:15:57,092 --> 00:16:00,862
for you. Then we have to have

238
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:05,700
patience, as I already mentioned, and understand that

239
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,746
it's not magic, it's a process that

240
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:15,506
we need to build upon. The initial response from the AI might

241
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:18,598
not be perfect, so you might need to refine your prompt based on

242
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:22,374
the output that you received and making it better and

243
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:25,894
better, and creating a

244
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:28,620
communication process with your tool.

245
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,354
And I think that using a tool like this

246
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:36,938
will teach you more about how to craft effective prompts and

247
00:16:36,944 --> 00:16:39,820
communicate more efficiently based on the responses you get.

248
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,046
So by analyzing a bit the response that you

249
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:47,854
get from an AI tool, you can see exactly what are

250
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:51,498
you lacking. Maybe you were not very clear with the format

251
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,010
that you wanted the response to be like you want it

252
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,670
in a specific language, you want it to be more formal,

253
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,942
you want it to be in a JSON format.

254
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:05,794
Maybe it depends on what you're asking from it,

255
00:17:05,832 --> 00:17:09,240
or maybe you could have

256
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,154
created a Persona for that. So for example, you can say to your AI,

257
00:17:13,202 --> 00:17:16,630
okay, I want you to answer to this question as you

258
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,278
were a highly experimented architect,

259
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:24,714
software architect, and I want you to give me the answer in

260
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:30,474
that specific way, in a very informed

261
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:33,822
and professional way. So you have to

262
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:38,320
also create a context and

263
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,410
give feedback to the AI in order for it to

264
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,026
answer to your needs. But let's play a bit with it

265
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:50,100
just to see how this works.

266
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,540
Let's see,

267
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,298
so we have in here Chat

268
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:03,190
GPT four, and for example,

269
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,566
let's say that I'm first just

270
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,300
going to ask for him, okay,

271
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:21,774
give me the solid principles so

272
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:26,990
we can see that it's giving us a very complex,

273
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:33,074
very explicit answer and with

274
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,980
a lot of details, which is good. But for example, let's say that

275
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:43,362
I'm just someone that is learning right now about

276
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:47,014
solid principles. So I want the eye to give

277
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:50,390
me real world examples.

278
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,998
So I'm just going to ask him a

279
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:58,282
bit more specific, something like this,

280
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:03,450
okay, explain to

281
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,250
me the solid principles

282
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,040
with real world

283
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,238
examples. And also because I

284
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:29,090
don't want to stay and wait a lot and I need very specific answers,

285
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,540
I wanted to keep

286
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,550
it short on the explanations.

287
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,854
Keep in mind that

288
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:45,960
I am.

289
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,094
Let's see you

290
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,040
giving also the context as you can see?

291
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,360
So it's starting to build

292
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,640
things as you asked, in order to get as

293
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,874
specific answers as possible. So it's going to give

294
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:25,250
us examples for edge.

295
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,942
Great. Now we are going just

296
00:20:36,996 --> 00:20:39,806
to see how it keeps track of the context. We are going to say,

297
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:47,214
okay, now give

298
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:48,000
me,

299
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,730
let it

300
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,872
presentation outline that

301
00:21:05,006 --> 00:21:10,860
I can use for the first principle.

302
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,944
So I don't have to say again for the first solid

303
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:21,264
principle and so on, because it has the context, it know

304
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:24,880
exactly on what principle am I referring to.

305
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,570
So it's building up on that.

306
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,224
And right now it's going to give us a

307
00:21:32,262 --> 00:21:36,060
context on the first principle

308
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,596
and creating a presentation outline

309
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:43,104
for that. And it's amazing also with

310
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:45,930
real world the examples. Great, great.

311
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,400
So we can use it in order to build and build. And then if

312
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,730
I don't think that this was okay, I can say, for example,

313
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,160
make it shorter.

314
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,136
It is. And this

315
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:09,730
intended for it,

316
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,810
twelve years old,

317
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,680
classic.

318
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,790
So it's creating it even more specific for our needs.

319
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,356
I'm going to give some resources

320
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:41,960
to you for both Chat GPT and copilot and how to

321
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,396
install it and how you can use it. More precisely,

322
00:22:45,428 --> 00:22:49,150
we're not going to go very much in details because the time is not

323
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,816
very long, but let's look also a bit on what we can do with copilot.

324
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,540
So for example, let's take it from scratch.

325
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,840
I have a very random project

326
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,850
in here that I used at some point for a training.

327
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,192
So I am connected, I already

328
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:14,004
have an account connected to

329
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:17,284
copilot, so I'm just going to go and

330
00:23:17,402 --> 00:23:20,900
activate the GitHub copilot chat. So on one side

331
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:26,104
we can have it like this, we can discuss with

332
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:29,652
it as we are discussing

333
00:23:29,716 --> 00:23:32,792
also with Chat GPT. So let's just use

334
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:36,284
one of the suggested commands and say,

335
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:39,660
okay, explain this text

336
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,510
that I,

337
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,870
I'm trying to,

338
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,376
I select it and it's explaining exactly what's the deal with

339
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:59,330
the router provider and with router and what is this supposed to be doing?

340
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,476
Another thing that we can

341
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:06,644
do with it, let's see,

342
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:10,470
for example, we can put in here,

343
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,700
let's go to home because it's easier.

344
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,552
Here we have some comments and then we have some links and so

345
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:25,064
on. But what I wanted to do

346
00:24:25,102 --> 00:24:28,804
is, for example, let's say I can activate

347
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:32,410
it with create

348
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,920
header component.

349
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:45,520
So it's,

350
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,864
let's put it outside so it can get a

351
00:24:54,902 --> 00:24:55,680
context.

352
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,490
Let's see,

353
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,010
let's just,

354
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,750
okay, let's try something more.

355
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,530
Let's create function

356
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,330
that calculates the

357
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,320
time between two dates.

358
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,130
Yeah, whatever.

359
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,210
So function,

360
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,844
and it's giving some suggestions to us.

361
00:26:08,882 --> 00:26:12,444
Of course it comes to us

362
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:15,996
to correct and see if it's what we need and so

363
00:26:16,018 --> 00:26:19,970
on and so forth. Let's see.

364
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,810
Okay, great.

365
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,748
Another thing that we can do is

366
00:26:30,934 --> 00:26:34,596
activating it also from this modify, using copilot, and you can

367
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:38,564
say to it exactly what you want for

368
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:42,356
this code snippet to

369
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:43,270
do.

370
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,360
So basically you can use it as you saw,

371
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,328
as soon as you started writing something,

372
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:57,784
it began suggesting things to you, giving explanations.

373
00:26:57,912 --> 00:27:01,212
Of course we can use, for example, we can create

374
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,844
another function, let's close this one. We are going

375
00:27:04,882 --> 00:27:09,072
to help

376
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:14,288
it. For example, we are going to do something

377
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:18,450
like this. Create a

378
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,010
function that

379
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,930
perfect. Okay.

380
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:39,828
It sometimes it's

381
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:43,224
a bit slower. Of course, as I said, we need to be

382
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,952
patient with it. I think I

383
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:50,356
interrupted it slow. So it's

384
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:54,156
not giving the answer that quickly. And also I think

385
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:56,750
that my Internet connection is a bit bad.

386
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:07,116
Let's see. So it's giving it, but it's

387
00:28:07,148 --> 00:28:10,812
suggesting it. But the format, since I did not specify the format,

388
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:14,980
it's giving me suggestions,

389
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,084
like comments. We can play

390
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:23,220
with it, but you got the idea.

391
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,704
It's something that since you know exactly what is the

392
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:32,170
context that you are trying to use in there, you are going to

393
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,670
be able to be as specific as possible.

394
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,484
Okay, going back to our

395
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:45,884
presentation. So if it is to think

396
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:48,776
we went through to the play time,

397
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:52,192
we can see that we can chat with it,

398
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:56,160
we can generate by using the comments

399
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,760
you can select and then having

400
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,124
suggestions in there on the selected code that we want to work

401
00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:06,772
with. It can predict and complete what we started,

402
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:10,964
as we did with. The function that calculates the time

403
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:14,644
between two dates is matching patterns with regular

404
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:18,484
expressions. We can also write unit codes,

405
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:21,732
unit tests, writing commands.

406
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:25,210
It's generating sample data. So we can play with it

407
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,796
in a lot of ways. And I strongly invite you to work

408
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:33,084
with it and see what are the strong points and where are the things that

409
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:36,396
you need to be more precise or to be a bit more specific with

410
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:40,400
it. So when it comes to the integration

411
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,640
in our software development processes,

412
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,972
first of all we need to understand the capabilities of our AI.

413
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:52,004
And as you were able to see,

414
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:56,020
we have to learn exactly how to specify

415
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,484
the context, how to specify the format, so that

416
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:05,960
we in time can train and get as good

417
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,972
answer as possible. Don't forget

418
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:14,040
to be as realistic as possible. As you've seen,

419
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,716
it's not always that sharp. So you need to be

420
00:30:18,738 --> 00:30:22,590
patient with it to create a context for example I used especially

421
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,550
to not have the perfect context for it. I used a very

422
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,316
simple but let's

423
00:30:34,348 --> 00:30:37,872
say not with

424
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:41,244
a lot of things in it. The project that I

425
00:30:41,302 --> 00:30:45,104
played with it just to show you exactly that, if you're

426
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:48,564
giving less context, it's going to

427
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:53,424
give you answers more or less generic

428
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:56,376
because it doesn't know exactly how to shape. So it needs some time. We are

429
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,504
doing this first time in that project, so it needs some time to

430
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:04,424
adjust to exactly what are the patterns that we are trying to

431
00:31:04,622 --> 00:31:09,404
do in there. Then see exactly how the

432
00:31:09,442 --> 00:31:13,692
AI tool that you are choosing is aligning with the project needs,

433
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:17,436
that you have the team expertise and see

434
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:23,424
exactly how easy it is to integrate and what

435
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:24,850
resources do you need?

436
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,256
My advice is to try to work with tools and in

437
00:31:30,278 --> 00:31:33,830
general, it's not only for AI that you can

438
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,340
configure for your product that

439
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,710
are flexible and you can work with and

440
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,040
have strong compatibility with existing systems for effective implementation

441
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,176
on your side. Also try to keep as up to date as

442
00:31:53,198 --> 00:31:53,770
possible.

443
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,004
Work with it constantly in order to see what are the

444
00:32:01,122 --> 00:32:04,910
capabilities and give feedback in order to

445
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,460
maintain its effectiveness and relevance.

446
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:13,056
Gradually integrate AI into development workflows. Don't do

447
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:16,624
it all at once. Get used to it. Play maybe in

448
00:32:16,742 --> 00:32:20,944
small projects before actually putting it into your product and

449
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:25,168
see how it evolves step by step, like how it's improving its

450
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:28,564
answer step by step and encourage your team

451
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:32,928
to use AI. I think that we need to foster a learning environment

452
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,324
and we need to adapt to AI capabilities

453
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:40,324
for successful integrating. Instead of relying

454
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:43,576
on all of those needs that we were saying on the beginning, we need to

455
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:48,876
be prepared and to educate ourselves some

456
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:51,980
of the best practices for integrating AI tools.

457
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,092
Just to keep in mind that as we

458
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:59,632
embrace AI tools in our development workflow, it's crucial to follow

459
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,916
some best practices and to understand the tool to ensure

460
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:07,852
effectiveness and ethical integration.

461
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:11,976
And these practices not only enhance the benefits we derive

462
00:33:12,028 --> 00:33:16,196
from AI, but also helps us understand

463
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:20,228
what are the potential risks and challenges and how we can work into

464
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:23,792
resolving those. So when you are starting

465
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:27,690
with working with AI, be specific

466
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,812
with your goals. Why are you using AI

467
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,744
and integrate it step by step.

468
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:38,520
Stay updated with the latest advancements

469
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,316
and implement quality control for all the outputs that

470
00:33:42,338 --> 00:33:46,088
you are using. Use AI ethically.

471
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:50,172
Focus on data privacy and try to mitigate

472
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:52,450
bias as much as possible.

473
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,192
Don't try to replace, but rather enhance human

474
00:33:58,246 --> 00:34:01,956
skills by using AI capabilities. Address security

475
00:34:02,058 --> 00:34:05,540
risks and ensure privacy in your AI tools and

476
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,380
the way you are doing the integration.

477
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,744
Try to keep the team as

478
00:34:18,782 --> 00:34:22,484
close as possible and foster collaboration

479
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:26,250
and communication, even though they are using an AI tool,

480
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,396
and use these tools as a

481
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,364
whole responsibly and try to enhance the

482
00:34:34,402 --> 00:34:38,536
software developers into

483
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:41,884
an area where it becomes efficient

484
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:46,210
and of quality, so enhance its

485
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,800
features.

486
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,524
I completely agree that it's important to consider

487
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:59,236
the long term implication of AI investments and to be

488
00:34:59,258 --> 00:35:02,400
mindful of the environmental

489
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,640
impact of scaling up AI infrastructure.

490
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,224
And every time I hear something about this, I'm like yes,

491
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:14,932
exactly. We need to take care of this because as we continue to innovate

492
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:18,776
and evolve with AI, we should also think about what the future holds

493
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:24,060
and how AI can contribute positively

494
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,736
to the advancement of society.

495
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:33,212
It's our responsibility to make sure that AI development

496
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:37,132
and integration aligns with ethical

497
00:35:37,196 --> 00:35:41,308
responsibility. We need to think beyond the immediate application

498
00:35:41,414 --> 00:35:45,350
and consider how AI can shape our world in the long run

499
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,776
and ensure our technologies progress

500
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:54,504
goes hand in hand with sustainability and these

501
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:57,832
ethical principles that we need to take care

502
00:35:57,886 --> 00:36:01,930
of. So be mindful of this. When you are

503
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,052
going all in, in a project, in a product,

504
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:09,790
or in the way you are using AI in your day to day life,

505
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,510
all in, all, in here you can have

506
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,576
some resources that you can use and

507
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:24,960
where you can learn more or how to activate

508
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,712
these tools and how to work with them. And you can also play

509
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:33,984
with Samsung. I gave you some resources thank
