00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,526
Hi there, and welcome to the typing biometrics journey. Together,

2
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:29,126
we'll go through some theory and practice of that, and by the end of

3
00:00:29,148 --> 00:00:32,646
it, you're going to find out how you can win some limited edition swag from

4
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,840
typing dna. So, without further ado, let's get it started.

5
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,002
First of all, what exactly is typing biometrics?

6
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:45,730
So, this is something also known as keystroke dynamics,

7
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,962
and it is embedded in people's behavior when they type on a keyboard.

8
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:54,042
So, yes, you heard that right. The way that you type is unique,

9
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:57,594
and it can be used for various purposes that we're going to explore

10
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:01,642
further in this presentation. Now, this might sound futuristic,

11
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:05,406
but it dates back to World War II,

12
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:08,962
when the military used to communicate through the Morse code.

13
00:01:09,096 --> 00:01:12,926
So, using a methodology called the fist of the sender,

14
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:16,194
military intelligence were able to detect

15
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:20,070
the rhythm of the operator's

16
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,826
point, recording the dots and the dashes,

17
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,218
and they could identify ally from enemy

18
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,886
in this context. Now, since then, the preference for written

19
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:33,420
communication grew, and with it,

20
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,446
the field of typing biometrics evolved.

21
00:01:37,638 --> 00:01:41,158
So one area which is the most

22
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:44,890
explored and developed at the moment is authentication.

23
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,142
So, using the way that you type in order

24
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:51,422
to authenticate you. Now, at this point,

25
00:01:51,476 --> 00:01:55,326
I think we can all agree that passwords alone are not enough to secure

26
00:01:55,358 --> 00:01:59,538
your account. So I want to make a short detour to the authentication space

27
00:01:59,624 --> 00:02:02,526
before going into more details on typing biometrics.

28
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:06,898
So, when we talk authentication, we can basically split

29
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,410
the different factors into three categories,

30
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,254
knowledge, possession, and biometrics. Knowledge is

31
00:02:13,292 --> 00:02:16,450
something that you know, such as a pin or a password,

32
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,846
or the security question, such as what is your mother's maiden

33
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,722
name? The possession factors are something that you own,

34
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:27,018
like a phone number, an email address,

35
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:30,546
a token, something that you could further leverage,

36
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:34,414
that could receive kind of a one time password or

37
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:38,654
code on it. And the third category is

38
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:42,254
biometrics. And here we can further split the

39
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:46,100
factors into physiological, something that you are.

40
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,006
And here you can have the fingertips, the face recognition

41
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:54,706
or behavioral, something that

42
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,886
is related to the way that you behave, such as the way that you walk,

43
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:02,406
the way that you talk, or the way that you type. Now,

44
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:06,258
if we were to compare the security aspects

45
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:10,054
of them, the security and ux point of view,

46
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:13,862
the knowledge factors are the most user friendly because

47
00:03:13,996 --> 00:03:17,494
people are already used to them. However, they tend to be

48
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:21,406
not so secure, because once somebody hacks your information

49
00:03:21,508 --> 00:03:24,846
or finds out what it is, then it's very

50
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:30,506
easy to break. And let's not forget that people usually reuse,

51
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:34,306
share the passwords or the information to make it

52
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:38,286
easier. Now, possession is a bit more secure,

53
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:42,146
but it tends to be not so user friendly because

54
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:45,602
the devices could be lost or stolen.

55
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:49,554
So then imagine you are stranded somewhere,

56
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:53,142
your phone got stolen, you're trying to contact,

57
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:57,046
let's say, your bank, or you're trying to send an email, and then

58
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:01,082
it sends you the SMS and you cannot basically log

59
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:04,826
in, authenticate because your device was initially lost or

60
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:08,218
stolen. So it can generate some user experience

61
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:11,962
problems here. Now the third category, the biometrics,

62
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:15,694
are supposed to be the most secure ones. However, this could

63
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:19,742
also pose some user experience issues because they might

64
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:23,890
require kind of a heavy interaction

65
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,410
from the user side. It can also have some problems in

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,514
detecting it because nothing is black or white here.

67
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:35,926
This is not a one or zero response to authentication as it is in the

68
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:39,958
case of the knowledge or the possessions ones. And you're basically basing your

69
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:43,926
authentication assumption on a certain

70
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:47,602
certainty threshold. But among all of this,

71
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:51,660
we believe typing biometrics to be the winner in terms of

72
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,210
adding two factor authentication.

73
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,226
And this is because, first of all,

74
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:02,846
it's very secure because it's hard to break, it's hard

75
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:06,510
to mimic. Even though somebody is next to you and sees

76
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,782
what your password is, they cannot replicate how

77
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:14,686
you type it. It's also compliant with the latest

78
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,054
regulations. So according to PSD,

79
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:20,542
two rules, typing by matrix is accepted

80
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:24,034
as a second factor. And it's very user friendly because you

81
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:27,622
don't need to do anything additional than what you're already

82
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:31,398
doing, basically typing. And you can use your own device, you don't need

83
00:05:31,484 --> 00:05:34,386
another keyboard or other hardware.

84
00:05:34,578 --> 00:05:38,086
And it also evolves as the user's typing

85
00:05:38,118 --> 00:05:41,786
behavior changes over time. So it's constantly adapted to

86
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,162
the behavior and it's kept as

87
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:49,340
updated as possible. The more that you type then the better your

88
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,550
typing profile gets. Now, this is currently

89
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,698
being heavily used into elearning,

90
00:05:56,794 --> 00:06:00,446
especially since COVID hit and more and

91
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:03,634
more universities and courses moved online. Also, the need

92
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:07,182
to secure the courses and certifications

93
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:10,546
grew and we have various clients that reached out and

94
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:14,194
they implemented typing dna authentication in

95
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:18,134
various steps of the journey being it while taking the

96
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:21,414
exam. Also at the end, to ensure that the person who

97
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:25,222
started the exam was also the same one that was

98
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:28,518
continually doing the exam and finished it, and is the

99
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,366
same person as the one that took the course initially,

100
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,386
we also have clients from the banking area financial services

101
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:39,130
because I was mentioning the PSD. Two regulations now require

102
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,214
online transactions to have a second factor in place and

103
00:06:43,252 --> 00:06:46,654
many of them turned to typing biometrics in order

104
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:50,702
to secure the transaction and the identity access

105
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,778
management providers could also not stay away from this opportunity.

106
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:57,666
So you can now have typing biometrics at the

107
00:06:57,688 --> 00:07:01,326
click of a button, literally drag and drop in your favorite IAM

108
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:04,910
widgets such as forestrock or Azure,

109
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,294
ADB to c. All right, now that it's been a lot of talk,

110
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:12,530
so let's see how this would actually work in practice.

111
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,882
So the first step, as with any other biometric, is recording

112
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:21,206
the behavior. And we do this through an open source recorder

113
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:25,034
through which we capture the times needed to press and

114
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:28,490
release keys. Also the way that you move between

115
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,366
the keys, the way that you hold your phone if

116
00:07:32,388 --> 00:07:35,790
you're on a mobile device, and how you basically

117
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,102
interact with your device, including the mouse movements. So all

118
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:42,414
sorts of data points are collected through the

119
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:45,762
open source recorder and then the output of this

120
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:49,950
is taken through data engineering so as to extract

121
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,426
only the signals which are the most relevant and used

122
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:58,146
for creating your typing profile. We do this initially two

123
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:01,602
or three times to create the user's typing profile.

124
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,838
This is very similar to what you do when you have a new phone and

125
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:08,326
you need to configure your fingerprint scanner. So you do it in the beginning a

126
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:11,830
couple of more times until the system literally creates

127
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,766
your profile. And after that, every time you come back, we compare

128
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:19,222
the typing profile to what we have stored as your typing

129
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:22,480
profile. And if

130
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,114
the matching is above a certain threshold,

131
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:31,086
then we say okay, yes, we allow the authentication so it's a success.

132
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:34,866
If it's not, then we say okay, probably this is not

133
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:39,026
the person who he or she claims to be.

134
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,594
Right, so enough theory, let's see how this

135
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:45,778
would work in practice. I'll just switch now

136
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:49,382
to the typing DNA website and show you a bit of

137
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:53,510
an already done widget that you can super easily implement.

138
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,654
And this is for demo purposes so you also see how it would work.

139
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:00,998
And then I'll show you how you could alternatively

140
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:05,094
use the authentication API so you make your own custom implementation.

141
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:08,698
So, right, we are on the typingdna.com website. What you need

142
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:12,362
to do firstly is create an account so you sign

143
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,758
up. All of our accounts are for free so you don't need to

144
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,166
pay for any of the solutions. And after you sign up you're going to be

145
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:22,974
redirected to the dashboard where you can find your information

146
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:26,718
also from the verify product which is

147
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:29,442
the already made widget. I'm going to show you in a moment, but as well

148
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:32,690
for the authentication API. But let's start with the demo.

149
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,306
Let's see how this could actually work from here. You can do

150
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:39,320
the verified demo here. I already opened it.

151
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,274
So to begin with we need to create, as I was mentioning, the user's typing

152
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,414
profile and we also need a route of trust to

153
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:50,582
see if basically to have a data

154
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:53,894
point that would associate a typing profile with the

155
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:58,266
person. And we need to make sure that this person is indeed the

156
00:09:58,288 --> 00:10:01,866
one that provided the phone number or the email address if they have it.

157
00:10:01,888 --> 00:10:05,406
So I'll just go for email and

158
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:08,798
I'll write here a dummy email address. I'm going to

159
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:11,614
do this for the first time so you can see the flow end to end.

160
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:15,602
So I input my email to have a data

161
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,962
point that this is basically

162
00:10:19,016 --> 00:10:22,500
the only contact Pii information that we have over you.

163
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,726
And it can also be used as a fallback method in

164
00:10:26,748 --> 00:10:30,482
case something goes terribly wrong. And let's say you temporarily

165
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,546
break your arm or something happens, then you can opt for the fallback

166
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:38,194
method and you're still able to access

167
00:10:38,252 --> 00:10:43,162
your two fa, right? So I'll just start a demo now and

168
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:46,634
I need to write these words. As you can see,

169
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:50,234
the number of words or characters is not so

170
00:10:50,272 --> 00:10:53,514
high. So the user experience is good. And here on the right

171
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:58,026
side, this thing shows that the typing pattern has been recording while it typed.

172
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:01,806
Now, because this is the first time I do it, I need to create my

173
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,154
typing profile. So this time only I need to type two more

174
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:09,380
times and one more

175
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,542
it. All right, now I will receive again one time

176
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:20,600
only, a security code,

177
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,240
just copy paste it,

178
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,678
right? So my typing profile has been created

179
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:32,394
and it was the same as the one that I inputted the first

180
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:35,530
time. So how can I say that the second

181
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,062
and third type profile like behavior

182
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:42,350
typing behaviors were similar

183
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,014
to the first one that I did first. But let's start this

184
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:49,566
over. So now I have my typing profile created and

185
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:53,026
I'll try to authenticate. I'll start again. I'll use

186
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:56,466
the same email address so it knows which Devin profile to

187
00:11:56,488 --> 00:12:04,706
access and I'll start it right?

188
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:08,054
And that's it. The verification has been successful and I was

189
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:11,938
allowed into my account. So see, as easy as typing

190
00:12:12,034 --> 00:12:15,474
four small words and you already have your two fa

191
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:18,886
in place. So if this made you curious enough to

192
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:22,506
want to give it a more of a deep dive, try. I'll show

193
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:26,218
you now how you can implement it with how you

194
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:30,606
can test out basically with the authentication API that

195
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:34,720
we have available. So I'm going to use postman for that.

196
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,398
The first step here is basically

197
00:12:40,484 --> 00:12:44,898
is to go to the typing DNA page. Go here and access

198
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,430
like download the Postman library collection.

199
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,066
It's very easy to get it from here and import it into

200
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:55,202
your postman account. I already have it imported here.

201
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:59,410
Now after it's imported, you need to add your credentials.

202
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,650
So you go back to the dashboard, you switch to the authentication API

203
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,494
tab and you take your key and your secret. From here

204
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:11,626
you go into the configurations basic auth and put your

205
00:13:11,648 --> 00:13:15,590
username and password. This is for us to know that it was you accessing

206
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,174
the API. Now. Next we're going to use the auto

207
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:22,494
endpoint. This is basically a magical endpoint that

208
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:25,882
does everything for you. So it will firstly,

209
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:29,726
the first three times enroll the typing pattern. So an

210
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:33,406
enrollment means adding to the typing profile

211
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,060
of the person to create the profile itself.

212
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,566
Also every time we have a qualitative typing

213
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:45,006
pattern, we add it to the typing profile so it's

214
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:48,454
kept up to date. This is also part of the enrollment. And the

215
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:52,246
auto endpoint also does all the verifications. So here you

216
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:55,414
can see multiple endpoints. But basically auto is the one

217
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:59,302
that you can use for almost all the use cases that you have,

218
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:03,334
unless you want to make it a very custom implementation

219
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:07,130
case which you can use these other two. Right, so we have,

220
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,986
let's say the back end configured now with postmo. Now you might be

221
00:14:11,008 --> 00:14:14,686
wondering, all right, but where can I get a typing profile so I

222
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,142
can start testing? And we have that figured out as well.

223
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:21,694
So if you go on the typingdna.com website under

224
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:24,886
authentication API, we have created this typing pattern

225
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:28,706
viewer which is basically a tool that outputs the

226
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:32,162
typing patterns after you write in the text box here.

227
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:36,194
So I'm going to use this type to output tool to generate the typing patterns

228
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,002
and then verify them through postman through the typing dna

229
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:43,462
collection. Ready? So we already have a phrase for this.

230
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll type it now.

231
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,474
Make yourself necessary to somebody. We ran multiple tests and

232
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:57,420
apparently this phrase is very effective into

233
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,210
the, how can I say, improving the accuracy of the verification with

234
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,714
lowering the number of characters needed. So this is a perfect combination

235
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:08,794
of short text but good accuracy in detection and it generated

236
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:12,462
the typing patterns. Here you can see three types, same text,

237
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:15,794
any text and extended the difference between them. So with

238
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,490
the same text, this means that every time you're trying to perform

239
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,862
authentication, so create the typing profile of the user

240
00:15:22,926 --> 00:15:26,134
and verify it like authenticate based

241
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:28,870
on it. You must use the same text,

242
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,718
identical same text every time.

243
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:35,302
Now with any text we allow you

244
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:39,098
to write or the users to write anything that they might think of.

245
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:42,954
However, we require higher number of characters here.

246
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:46,810
So same text works better with short but

247
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,206
identical text every time, whereas any text is more flexible, but it requires

248
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:54,358
the user to write more. Then it's up to you how you decide to do

249
00:15:54,384 --> 00:15:57,822
the implementation. But for the sake of the exercise, we'll go for the same text.

250
00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:01,354
So we're going to use this phrase to create the typing

251
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:05,110
profile and then authenticate based on it, right? So now I'm

252
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,334
just going to copy this copy, go into my auto,

253
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:11,618
I'm going to create a new user here. So this is

254
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:15,266
sending basically the user Id. Please make sure this is an

255
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:18,630
id that you're sending if you're going to implement it, not some type of

256
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,766
Pii. We don't want that. And we just

257
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:25,602
copy paste here the typing pattern that we were generated

258
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,240
before. I'll hit send and the message came back,

259
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,234
right? It seems I used this user before and

260
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:38,074
if I were to check for it, let's see, how many typing patterns did

261
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:41,342
I have on it? So the thing is, I used the same user id

262
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:45,550
before. We already have a typing pattern

263
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,014
profile basically for it, and now we just did the authentication not from the

264
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:53,780
beginning. So for just the sake of this, I'll just use

265
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,554
let's do it like this for sure. This one I didn't do. I'll go back

266
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:58,660
and do it again.

267
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,886
It, as you can see, many mistakes but nowhere is there.

268
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:12,806
I copy this, I go back and the reason why

269
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:16,134
I didn't hit send with can user Id is because

270
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,766
no typing pattern, no two typing patterns are identical, not even for

271
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,970
the same user. So if I could have tried

272
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,506
to send the same typing pattern as before, then I

273
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:30,086
would have gotten an error back saying this might be a fraud

274
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:33,946
attempt or like an attack. So that's why I prefer to generate

275
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:37,710
a new one that I'm going to send now under this new user did

276
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,054
and it says the pattern was enrolled, but they're not enough

277
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:44,722
for verification. So I just enrolled it. The action done was

278
00:17:44,776 --> 00:17:48,146
enrolled. I need to do this two more times in order to create the

279
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,506
profile, right? So going back here, reset, writing the

280
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,660
exact same text,

281
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,186
get this copy paste

282
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:04,694
and send again, not enough for verification. I just

283
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:08,700
enrolled it now I should have two and one last time

284
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,100
I get this, I copy back here,

285
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,578
I send it over right the third time I

286
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:25,166
enroll it. Now if I go into the check user, I'll just copy the

287
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:29,214
user id from here. Check user is going to show me how many

288
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:33,150
typing patterns I have for this user. And it says

289
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,546
I have account of three, which is good, means my profile is complete and

290
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:40,466
I can proceed with authentication and verification. But all

291
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:44,002
of them are on desktop. So desktop and mobile are different

292
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:47,590
because the physical keyboards behave differently than the mobile ones.

293
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,446
So this is why if you want to verify from

294
00:18:51,468 --> 00:18:55,986
the mobile device, make sure the mobile profile was created previously

295
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,594
or you ask the user to create it then. Right? So with discount of three,

296
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:03,462
I'm going back to auto and now my profile is created.

297
00:19:03,526 --> 00:19:06,666
I'll try to do the verification. Going back.

298
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,260
I reset it, try to examine same text.

299
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,360
I get it.

300
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,090
And the message came back, it's done. And what it said is,

301
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,674
first of all we did the verification and

302
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:30,658
it was successful because the result was one. And then because

303
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:34,386
we believe this typing pattern to have

304
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:38,194
a high quality, then we also added to the typing

305
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:41,778
profile of the person. So enroll. So we did those verification

306
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:45,702
with the result of one, which meant authentication successful and

307
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:49,126
enrollment with the result of one. Meaning we also added to the

308
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:52,966
profile. Now, I asked a colleague of mine to generate

309
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:56,186
a typing profile before this talk on

310
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,642
the exact same text that we used, just to show you what would happen

311
00:19:59,776 --> 00:20:03,086
if somebody would try

312
00:20:03,108 --> 00:20:06,570
to break in into your account by the typing behavior.

313
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,298
So I already have a typing profile previously generated.

314
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:14,000
I will just copy paste it from here and see what happens.

315
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,226
All right. So the action done of it was verification and

316
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:21,714
the result was zero, meaning the authentication was not

317
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:25,458
successful. We don't believe this person to be who they claim to be.

318
00:20:25,544 --> 00:20:28,662
And because of this, we also didn't do any enrollment because

319
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:32,246
obviously the typing pattern does not belong to the person, so we don't want to

320
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:35,398
add it to the typing profile. Pretty interesting,

321
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:39,082
right? I really encourage you after the talk to go and play a bit around

322
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:42,426
with it and try to test out with different friends or families and see

323
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:45,420
how it works with your own eyes.

324
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,378
Now, going back to the presentation, I know this

325
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:53,486
talk was on security and on the security

326
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:57,182
stage, but there's also one field which is worth

327
00:20:57,236 --> 00:21:01,278
mentioning in the typing biometrics space, which is the e health.

328
00:21:01,444 --> 00:21:05,394
So there are currently various startups and companies around

329
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,482
the globe which are investigating and researching into

330
00:21:08,536 --> 00:21:12,094
how you can apply type in biometrics for e health purposes

331
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:16,406
to detect various diseases associated mostly with

332
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:21,000
your brain and how you can detect it

333
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,310
and also help you throughout,

334
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,146
let's say, improving your state. So constantly monitoring

335
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:34,058
and taking action on the findings there is also quite

336
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:37,740
promising and I'm looking forward to see where this will go in the future.

337
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,530
Imagine you would have an e health app that

338
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,894
based on the way that you constantly type on your phone, on your

339
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:48,702
computer could say you might be at risk of having

340
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:52,646
this disease, maybe you should get yourself checked, or if you have the disease,

341
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,354
all right, your threshold now or your behavior indicated a

342
00:21:56,392 --> 00:22:01,650
progress, or maybe that your state just

343
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,186
went worse over the past one month or so on. So a lot of

344
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:09,954
potential here. I'm looking forward to see these companies evolve

345
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:13,654
over the time. But we at typing genetic could also not stay

346
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,886
away from the e health area because it has so much potential and

347
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:21,030
room for growth and for helping people. So we very recently

348
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,734
launched Focus, which is an app for improving your productivity.

349
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:30,442
So basically we

350
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:34,042
track how you type and then we can predict your mood

351
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:37,886
based on that and give you some recommendation on when you should take a

352
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:41,274
break or when you're the most focused.

353
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,590
And all of this with the purpose of improving your personal

354
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,466
productivity. So this app is also available for free. Now just go on

355
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:52,194
typingdna.com slash focus, check it out and let us know what you think

356
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:56,190
and if it helped you. Well, at TypingDna,

357

358
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,710
We believe this field to have great potential and we keep on exploring

359
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,934
over it. And I hope to have made you curious enough to

360
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:12,934

361
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:16,154
was not enough, we also created this special landing page

362
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:20,090

end. I want to thank you for your attention and leave you with a final

371
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,318
thought. So, as Picard rightfully said,

372
00:23:51,484 --> 00:23:55,426
things are only impossible until they're not. And typing

373
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,180
biometrics is the perfect example for that.
