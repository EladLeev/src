1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,026
You. Hello and welcome to Covid-19

2
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:32,374
is a cloud security catalyst. Thank you for joining this

3
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:36,102
session. And in the next 40, 45 minutes, we'll talk about

4
00:00:36,156 --> 00:00:39,670
security, about cloud security and how

5
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,366
the last one year, one year and a

6
00:00:43,388 --> 00:00:48,166
half impacted the way, how cloud

7
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,950
and how security is taken into consideration

8
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,120
by the organizations that are moving to cloud.

9
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,920
Before starting, before starting to talk about security and

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,210
what is the current status, I think that we should talk first of all

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,690
about where we are now and why security

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,940
and cloud security is so important.

13
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,000
The rules of the game change in the last 18 months

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,646
and the way, how the organization needs to scale in

15
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:26,598
a very different way. Just think about retails. Retails that had a small

16
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:30,118
presence on online, and over the night

17
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:33,354
they realized that from a small shop or

18
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:36,730
from a small online revenue, they need to handle almost

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,878
all their orders through their

20
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:44,058
online platform. And we don't

21
00:01:44,074 --> 00:01:48,000
talk about logistics and warehouse, let's just talk about

22
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,454
infrastructure, about it, about their it solutions.

23
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:56,754
And things were not easy and cloud

24
00:01:56,952 --> 00:02:00,466
was a good option and is a good option. But we need

25
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:05,166
to be aware of the things that we need

26
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,270
to configure, we need to set up to ensure that

27
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,382
the cloud environment is safe. And in a case

28
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:16,806
of a bridge of data breach or any kind

29
00:02:16,828 --> 00:02:21,450
of bridge we can track, we can know exactly what

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,740
that person done, what kind of data he accessed, for how long,

31
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,900
and maybe we can even track after he took the content,

32
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,054
where he opened that content, or if

33
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:40,510
he resolved it, if he reseller it now figures,

34
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,850
especially for the last 18 months, because this is what we want to target.

35
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,994
Take into account that the global adoption of digitalization has

36
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:52,834
increased with around 55% in the

37
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,740
last seven years.

38
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,006
So might not look so much, but from

39
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:03,126
the way how you do business, from the way how you sell your products and

40
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:06,614
your services, it's very important that more and

41
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:10,380
more companies decided to go online.

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,300
And until,

43
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,580
let's say, February or March 2020,

44
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,550
the strategy was, okay, a slow adoption.

45
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,374
But with the pandemic and

46
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:31,178
with the lockdown and with more or less interactions,

47
00:03:31,354 --> 00:03:35,186
guess what? 48% of

48
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:38,450
the organization had to accelerate their cloud migration.

49
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,690
So some of the companies were thinking about cloud,

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,600
or think about adapt cloud, but they had been planning two or three years.

51
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,126
Last year in March, a lot of them decided to

52
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,854
do the migration in the current financial year or in the

53
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:58,394
current calendaristic year. So they

54
00:03:58,432 --> 00:04:03,500
had problems. Not only is the finding the

55
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,066
best vendor, the best CSP, where they should run

56
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:11,102
their systems, but also they

57
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:15,178
had to look for the right people with the right skills

58
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:19,422
in a very short period of time. Some of them had to

59
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:22,670
build their capabilities,

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,786
they had to educate very fast their teams and

61
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:30,114
with working from home. That was not an easy job because

62
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:33,314
it's not same as in person class or in

63
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:36,534
person trainings. And the third thing that

64
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:40,662
they had to do is to build their cloud

65
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:44,886
center of excellence. And if you think that the

66
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:48,958
cloud center of excellence in an organization should contain all the best practices,

67
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:52,438
all the recommendations, all the blueprints

68
00:04:52,534 --> 00:04:56,294
that can be used by the organization to enhance, to adopt

69
00:04:56,342 --> 00:05:00,438
cloud, it was not an easy task to build in a few months. And of

70
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:03,790
course they might forgotten some things,

71
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,938
they might rush. And these are some concerns

72
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:10,766
that we need now to be aware, because now is a perfect moment in

73
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:14,434
time when a part of the organization are

74
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:18,274
already running inside cloud and they have enough time or

75
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:21,634
they have budget to do the

76
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:25,250
consolidation, especially from the security point of view,

77
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,774
review and indentify where they might do some

78
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:32,518
improvements and how then not only that,

79
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:36,118
but also from the operational and management point of view.

80
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:39,706
It's very important to ensure that you have the right services

81
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:43,740
and the right systems that are able to track,

82
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,866
are able to provide you insights related to

83
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:51,566
what is the user behavior, what are the action that

84
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,920
the user is doing on the cloud services,

85
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,446
and to track as much as possible all the steps that

86
00:05:58,468 --> 00:05:59,760
each user is doing.

87
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,974
Now think about the 60% adjusted cloud cybersecurity posture

88
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:09,330
as a result of distributed workforce.

89
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,354
What does this mean? That a large organization in the last

90
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:18,200
18 months decided to invest more

91
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,320
in their cloud cybersecurity, and especially because

92
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,478
a lot of their people were starting to work remotely

93
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:32,922
from their home and at the same time they started

94
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,986
to use cloud native services. And the

95
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:41,740
priorities change. From 2020 to 2021,

96
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,686
cloud security become very important and the

97
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:50,478
organization started to look more as a platform, as a service, and the software as

98
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:54,514
a service, features and services that

99
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:58,002
CSP are offering versus the standard service.

100
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:01,700
This means that the adoption took the next step,

101
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,640
and it's correct. Now,

102
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,274
what was the impact of Covid-19

103
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:15,800
from the security point of view, how it changed the

104
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,560
rules of the game?

105
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,598
Take into account that only in EU,

106
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:26,070
the number of cyber attacks increased

107
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,530
with 250%.

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,340
That's huge in only twelve months.

109
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,054
And that's crazy because it means that

110
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:43,330
a lot of organizations were attacked

111
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,778
using online tool, online system

112
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:55,106
and so on. And people who are still working from home, it means that

113
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:59,254
they already had problem because not all of them accepted working from home

114
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:03,094
or were ready to adopt working from home for all

115
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:04,310
their employees.

116
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,374
And also last year, the breaches of large breaches

117
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:13,946
increased with 273.

118
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:18,010
It means that in 2019, if we usually had only

119
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,974
one large breach on large systems,

120
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:26,382
now we had around, let's say free 3.5,

121
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:30,074
even four in some cases. And this is because it means that it's

122
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:33,298
more effort to the security team, to the IT team to ensure that they

123
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,106
are patching, they are fixing, they are protecting their solution in

124
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:38,100
the right way.

125
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,234
Now, working from home, what give us the opportunity to

126
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:48,470
browse not only to work from home,

127
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,246
not only to stay closely, closely to our friends and family,

128
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:55,986
but also when you have some free time, you don't go anymore

129
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:59,594
at a coffee with your colleague from other floor in the front

130
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:03,338
of the company. Maybe you just

131
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:07,050
look on the Internet reading news, finding out different

132
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,574
things, and it means that you are more open for

133
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:14,094
phishing scams. And yes, working from

134
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:18,240
home increased the phishing scam with 45%

135
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,120
might not sounds as a big number,

136
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:29,378
but think about it, 45% of people fall

137
00:09:29,464 --> 00:09:32,210
into different phishing scams. And it's very easy.

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,094
Just in this morning, when I opened my aqui email

139
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:39,906
account, I just seen in my spam, because from time to time I'm

140
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:43,462
also checking my spam, an email from

141
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,774
PayPal that were saying that my

142
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:50,226
account was blocked because

143
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:53,594
of a transaction that I've done this week. And I

144
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:57,542
need to enter in the PayPal to confirm that I've done the transaction.

145
00:09:57,606 --> 00:10:02,062
And that's funny because two days ago I

146
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:06,074
just done PayPal

147
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:10,254
pay to somebody and they use a

148
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:14,266
revolut card that was locked. When Revolut

149
00:10:14,298 --> 00:10:17,986
notified that I'm using PayPal, I unlocked I've done the pay the

150
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:21,266
payment. But it was very interesting, the connection between when

151
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:25,234
I've done the pay, the payment, the PayPal, I think that I didn't use

152
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:28,100
PayPal for the last two years,

153
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,326
blocking the revolut card. And also in my mind I said, okay,

154
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:36,050
it might block me in the future when I will do PayPal attacks.

155
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,366
And guess what? I had in my inbox, that mail

156
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:43,114
that was saying that my PayPal account was locked very

157
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:47,402
easily. Other people like me or like you could fall, could click

158
00:10:47,536 --> 00:10:50,410
and their PayPal account might be stolen.

159
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,086
So we have the Inciso phishing attacks with 350%

160
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:59,360
and half of the people were

161
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,882
scams, were falling in different

162
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,370
phishing scams.

163
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,914
Talking about the breaches and security breaches, think about that. Starting only

164
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:14,260
from February to May 2020,

165
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,294
around half a million people globally were affected by different

166
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:22,840
breaches, by different security breaches from,

167
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,190
and I'm not listening to general breaches. I'm referring to the ones when

168
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,694
you are in a video conference, any kind of video conference, and your own

169
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,978
data was stolen, your name, your email address,

170
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,206
maybe your phone and so on, and sold on dark

171
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,980
web. How they've done that, that's another story.

172
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,030
But think about that all the time. When you're joining

173
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,218
can online video conference,

174
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:51,806
you are sharing some data, you're sharing the data with the platform,

175
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:56,162
but also sometimes other attendees can see your data.

176
00:11:56,296 --> 00:12:00,260
So a lot of things can be done and

177
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,980
can be done to get your data, to steal your personal data.

178
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,726
Now, before jumping to security,

179
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,454
before talking about security, also I want to share with you

180
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:16,210
some insight related to how cloud adoption

181
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,266
and work. Cloud workloads increased in the last

182
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:21,340
one year.

183
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,094
So the increase in cloud workloads in different regions

184
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:30,794
is around 70 65% for APAC

185
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:34,560
and MA is 75%.

186
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,070
Sorry for Amar is around 65,

187
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,538
and for Japan it's around 58. But it's

188
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:48,226
still, it's a lot of increase in just one year. I would say that

189
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:51,746
it's huge and was a big step forward. I also notify on the

190
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:54,954
number of cloud projects that I'm involved. The stretch

191
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:58,738
become higher and higher. Now, if I'm looking at different industries

192
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:02,182
where the cloud workload started to

193
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:04,230
increase and increase drastically,

194
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,042
83% was on chemical manufacturers. When I

195
00:13:10,096 --> 00:13:13,766
saw this information, I was shocked. What chemical manufacturing?

196
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,970
How come? Because they're doing a lot of simulations,

197
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,290
and simulations need a lot of computation.

198
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,846
And also for chemical manufacturing, they were not

199
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:28,926
yet, let's say, adopting cloud. So this was a

200
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:32,126
good opportunity, more or less to force this

201
00:13:32,148 --> 00:13:35,842
and to go to cloud. And secondly, as everybody would expect,

202
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:40,146
was at retail with 60%. Why only 60%?

203
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,810
Because taking into account that a lot of large retailers were

204
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,638
already owning large

205
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:50,838
data centers or who are already working

206
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:54,710
with, let's say, private cloud providers or

207
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,220
large providers of IT

208
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,566
services and IT infrastructure on different countries,

209
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:06,570
and basically they just ramp up there also

210
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,938
on insurance that you could say that is indirectly affected

211
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:15,742
by Covid, the increase was with around 74%.

212
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:20,238
More and more people were doing

213
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:23,646
their insurance and thing like that from their home. They were

214
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:27,390
not going to an agent or to location

215
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,766
to talk about the insurance options and so on. So they also had to adopt

216
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:35,054
cloud. This is an old story, maybe you

217
00:14:35,112 --> 00:14:38,614
are aware of that. And it happened before

218
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:41,734
the pandemic in August 28,

219
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:45,234
when one of the big players

220
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:48,902
on the market, Vim, had configured

221
00:14:49,046 --> 00:14:52,986
one of their AWS systems to

222
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:56,890
do automatically backups. That was perfect.

223
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,546
The backups were done on an AWS S free storage

224
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:05,374
still, that was perfect. Nothing outrage from

225
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:09,406
there. The problem was that the

226
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:13,314
backup was done on an AWS free

227
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:16,546
storage that was public available, meaning that anybody from

228
00:15:16,568 --> 00:15:19,938
the Internet could access it in just a few hours,

229
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:23,860
because the timeframe where that

230
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,746
storage was publicly available on the Internet was a very short period

231
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:31,186
of time. But still there were some downloads.

232
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:35,314
Full down operation of the data backups. Now the backups were encrypted,

233
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:38,250
that's fine, and protected with the username and password.

234
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,442
Nevertheless, take into account

235
00:15:42,576 --> 00:15:46,890
that even

236
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,302
if you don't protect your data with strong username and

237
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:54,334
passwords, especially passwords, they can be very

238
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:57,120
easily broken. And just to give an example,

239
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,718
I think in 2014 or the last decade,

240
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,758
I think it happened in Chicago. I was at a security session

241
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:12,322
where in a 90 minutes session I saw how

242
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:15,410
a backup of an SQL database,

243
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,706
it was encrypted, was broken,

244
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:26,534
was break. Basically the

245
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:29,934
token of the password was replaced inside the backup.

246
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:33,946
And after that they were able to do the full restore of

247
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:37,158
the database on their own server. All the tools

248
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:40,762
that they use, and I think they use around eight or nine

249
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:44,126
different tools were more or

250
00:16:44,148 --> 00:16:47,646
less public available on the Internet. I'm more than sure that you

251
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:50,174
could find all the tools in one day.

252
00:16:50,372 --> 00:16:53,922
And anybody, even if you are twelve years old, if you would follow

253
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:57,090
all the steps, would be very easily to be done.

254
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,214
So Microsoft, sorry, cloud vendors

255
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:04,446
like Microsoft, AWS and GCP are offering

256
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:07,966
us a lot of tools that we can use to secure our system, to secure

257
00:17:07,998 --> 00:17:11,366
our payloads, secure our data. But still we need

258
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:14,566
to be aware how we do this configuration, how we

259
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:18,474
protect our data and what are the security features that we need,

260
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:22,186
because some of them are pretty expensive. So you

261
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,580
need to find the right balance between

262
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,962
premium security that each cloud vendor is offering versus the

263
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:33,902
free and default one. Or to bring your own security system that you are using

264
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:37,962
on on Prem system, because in the end you can have an virtual appliance

265
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:41,502
inside any cloud vendor where you can deploy your own

266
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:44,994
firewall, your own security monitoring system and so

267
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:45,620
on.

268
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,922
Okay, we talked a lot about some

269
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:55,574
facts. Until now I

270
00:17:55,612 --> 00:17:59,554
expect that most of you are developers or are technical

271
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:03,590
persons that are working from home for

272
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,206
different companies and so on. You might have

273
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:11,186
a repository, let's say GitHub repository, a CI

274
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:15,050
CD, a pipeline, and you are the dev hero

275
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,482
that is working. You are working on the project, you are doing

276
00:18:19,536 --> 00:18:22,826
a great job. Your system is using let's

277
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:26,590
say Azure storage. And to access the storage you use the account

278
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,190
key, the full account key. And of course

279
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,238
you are pushing that in the infrastructure repository where

280
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:38,020
that is very secure, it's not publicly available on the Internet and so on,

281
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,106
everything here, it's super, super secure, nobody can

282
00:18:43,128 --> 00:18:47,618
access it and that's perfectly fine. Your dev machine,

283
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,822
it's very secure and everything,

284
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:54,760
it's fine over there. Even still

285
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,882
you are also using the machine for your own needs and

286
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:04,058
somebody's pushing a malware on your system is

287
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,154
able to get your windows credentials and

288
00:19:08,192 --> 00:19:12,270
get access to your machine. From that on

289
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,990
he has access not only to the repository,

290
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,102
but also he puts his hand on the storage account key from

291
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:24,162
where he can go on different environments where that

292
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,938
key is used to get access to customer

293
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:31,394
data. This is why it's very important and all

294
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:36,242
the time to remember that segregation

295
00:19:36,306 --> 00:19:39,254
of teams, roles and responsibilities is very,

296
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:42,982
very important. Developers should never have

297
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:46,902
access directly for long periods of time on

298
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:50,474
environments, testing or pre production where customer data

299
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:53,340
are used or sensitive data.

300
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,578
There are some situation where you would like to provide temporary access,

301
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:01,166
but only temporary access. It means for 1 hour and

302
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:04,606
2 hours and be very cautious with that, don't just provide

303
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:09,946
access and to forget about that. So let's

304
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:13,140
jump to the subject, what can we do,

305
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,282
what can we do to protect our

306
00:20:17,336 --> 00:20:20,978
systems? There are a lot of things. So if you take a look

307
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:25,038
on Azure or AWS or GCP,

308
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:29,042
you will see a lot of recommendation for each service, for each use

309
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:32,354
case, and even for each industry, you will find a list of recommendation,

310
00:20:32,402 --> 00:20:35,734
list of service, something like that. But there are some common things that I

311
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:40,058
found that people are forgetting about and

312
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:45,962
what I will try to cover in the next 20

313
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:47,500
minutes, 25 minutes,

314
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,974
are the things that I seem that most of the time

315
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:56,814
forgotten and are very simple to fix. Even so, they are

316
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:01,022
hoping a big security holder could be used

317
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:04,834
by anybody. So the first thing that we

318
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:08,578
can do is limit the use of the cloud preview services

319
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:09,730
and features.

320
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,982
What does it mean? For example, in the case of Microsoft Azure,

321
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:19,634
we have for example a service or feature that can be in a private

322
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:23,080
preview, in public preview or in general availability.

323
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,866
What is the difference between them? In the private preview there's

324
00:21:26,898 --> 00:21:29,420
no SLA, there's no formal support.

325
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,450
For public preview there's some support,

326
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,482
but there's no SLA. And for GA, for general availability

327
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:41,360
you have full SLA support, formal support and so on.

328
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,542
Now the recommendation that also vendors are having,

329
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,934
the cloud vendor are having, and you need to take into account for

330
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:53,902
production environment for environments when you use sensitive

331
00:21:53,966 --> 00:21:58,018
customer data all the time, use only

332
00:21:58,104 --> 00:21:59,940
general availability services.

333
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,640
And a very good example here is

334
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,590
or if you remember the Cosmos DB security

335
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,550
issue that happened at the end of August.

336
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,474
But what we forgot, or a lot of people forgot to

337
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:26,378
mention, is that that happened

338
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:30,258
on a feature of Cosmos DB, or integration

339
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:33,902
of a service to Cosmos DB that was in

340
00:22:33,956 --> 00:22:35,070
public preview.

341
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,834
Meaning that if you would follow the recommendations Microsoft

342
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:45,558
is providing, you should never go in production with something like that because it's

343
00:22:45,594 --> 00:22:48,706
a public preview. Sometimes very hard to do that. But still,

344
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:52,530
you need to be aware of that and you need to be very cautious.

345
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,946
Now, how you can find, or how you can identify if a

346
00:22:56,968 --> 00:23:00,406
service preview or not. There are two ways that you can do that.

347
00:23:00,508 --> 00:23:03,766
The first of all, when you have the full directory of services,

348
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:08,570
let's take this example, the full directory of

349
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,694
Azure, of Microsoft Azure

350
00:23:12,742 --> 00:23:16,106
services. What we can notify here that in the

351
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:20,490
dashboard we have this preview

352
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:26,254
tag on the services that

353
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:30,218
are in preview and can be used very easily

354
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:34,426
just to know about what are the services that are in preview and to

355
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:38,594
not go with them in production or to get a clear timeline when

356
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:40,610
they will be live in GA.

357
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,998
This is very easy to do. The tricky part is with the services, with the

358
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,894
features, especially from each service, because some of them might be

359
00:23:50,092 --> 00:23:52,950
in preview, some of them might not be in preview,

360
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,426
especially if you have team that are using ETF

361
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,926
as a code, for example the resource management

362
00:24:00,978 --> 00:24:04,582
template. They might not be all the time aware of what is in preview,

363
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:08,060
what is not in preview, the current state of the preview, and so on.

364
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,286
For each service. For each Azure service you

365
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:15,918
will find pages under the documentation of a

366
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:20,030
service that is specifying what are the preview features,

367
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:24,722
what is the current strength and what is

368
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:28,514
covering. So you'll be able to know exactly

369
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:32,114
if some features that you are planning to use

370
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:35,518
are in a preview phase or not. What else we

371
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:39,666
can do. And this is, I think the most stronger

372
00:24:39,698 --> 00:24:42,994
thing that we can do is to educate,

373
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:46,854
educate all the organization about cloud, about cloud security and not

374
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:49,260
only the IT team. No.

375
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,626
Try to educate at a minimal level, at the foundation level

376
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:57,114
or as AWS is calling at a practitioner level,

377
00:24:57,312 --> 00:25:00,418
all the people from the organization,

378
00:25:00,614 --> 00:25:03,822
HR, financial and so on. Why?

379
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:07,310
Because each of them are using directly or indirectly,

380
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,406
some cloud services. They might end

381
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:15,346
up very easily not in the cloud portal or in

382
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:18,834
the cloud console, no, but they might end

383
00:25:18,872 --> 00:25:23,394
up in some specific location where this

384
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:27,560
information is very important to avoid the security issue.

385
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,970
Now you don't need to invest a lot in these kind of trainings.

386
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,054
What you can find on each CSP you

387
00:25:36,092 --> 00:25:40,074
will find free trainings, especially like for example the one that I'm showing from

388
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:44,118
Microsoft that are offering different type of trainings

389
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:47,850
for different roles, for business catalyst, for general

390
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,598
seller, for pre sellers, for data science. But also you

391
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:55,118
have all the time. For example, you have the azure fundamental and

392
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:59,338
AWS cloud practitioner certification. Not the certification,

393
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:02,320
but the content is very generic, it's very base.

394
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:07,342
You will ensure that people are understanding the base concepts

395
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:11,634
and covering the content in just four or 5 hours.

396
00:26:11,832 --> 00:26:15,002
They will already have the code

397
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,374
information that would allow them to understand how

398
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,942
cloud works and where that application is running and why.

399
00:26:21,996 --> 00:26:24,360
Sometimes they might have different issues.

400
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,834
What can we do? What more can we

401
00:26:31,872 --> 00:26:35,434
do? First of all, we can

402
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:38,250
use more identity access management.

403
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,942
And the yam part on AWS and on

404
00:26:42,996 --> 00:26:46,990
Azure are very mature and they

405
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,586
might not be so easy to be used all the time, but at least it's

406
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:54,514
providing you the power to have

407
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:58,510
a full control and use less. The master

408
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,254
user, for example the database access, that admin

409
00:27:02,302 --> 00:27:05,814
username and password, or that kind of user that are masters and have

410
00:27:05,852 --> 00:27:09,282
full access to all the databases or to specific database.

411
00:27:09,346 --> 00:27:12,886
You shouldn't use them and

412
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:16,898
try to use less account master key and tokens.

413
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:20,666
Think about Azure storage account, for example the account key,

414
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:24,070
you should never use it. You have the shared access signature,

415
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,460
you have the identity access management. You can provide access to different services

416
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,934
and different systems, to the

417
00:27:31,972 --> 00:27:36,094
storage, to the database and to other resources very

418
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:39,982
easily and without even having to

419
00:27:40,036 --> 00:27:44,658
provide token. Because inside

420
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:49,342
the cloud, inside, for example the Azure, all the services can do almost full authentication

421
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:53,086
and authorization based on their service principle.

422
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:57,346
And that's awesome. Externally you have limited tokens

423
00:27:57,378 --> 00:28:01,314
like for example shade access signature that can be used to provide a third party

424
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:04,742
access to a storage maybe or to some

425
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:08,406
of other type of data repositories and

426
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:12,054
so on. The problem with this kind of keys and token

427
00:28:12,102 --> 00:28:15,130
is that sometimes the team can forgot them,

428
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,586
can push them inside the configuration that would end up

429
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:21,818
in a repository, even if it's a private repository. Still it's

430
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:25,166
not safe enough. Especially when you have

431
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:29,166
a lot of people that are working or multiple teams that are working on

432
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:33,390
the same repository on the same project. The teams are changing,

433
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,474
but some people that are leaving the project and go on another project might

434
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:40,866
still have access to the alt repository, even if not

435
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:44,590
correct. Still it happens. So you need ways how you can ensure

436
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,310
that sensitive data are not pushed to that repository.

437
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,806
A very easy thing that you can do is using

438
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:56,566
different scanning tools like the one I'm sharing now, that basically

439
00:28:56,668 --> 00:29:00,518
what is doing is fully scanning a repository

440
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:04,742
to ensure that there are no secrets. There are no Azure

441
00:29:04,806 --> 00:29:08,874
AWS or GCP secrets pushed to that repository. And if any

442
00:29:08,912 --> 00:29:11,898
kind of secrets are identified automatically,

443
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:15,486
he would alert you. Or you can take an action and you

444
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:18,000
can do pretty nice things.

445
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,982
For example, you can do this kind of scams before

446
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:25,614
a push and you can reject commits where secrets are detected.

447
00:29:25,742 --> 00:29:29,054
You can have iterated them in the pipeline and the build to fail

448
00:29:29,182 --> 00:29:33,442
and automatically even to remove the secrets if

449
00:29:33,576 --> 00:29:37,622
a secret or sensitive data is indexified. And during

450
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:41,442
your 90 scan you can remove all the secrets.

451
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:44,806
You can even freeze pipelines or repository in case you

452
00:29:44,828 --> 00:29:48,134
find issues. Or you can even freeze the access

453
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:51,802
to the user, they've done a commit and

454
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,274
push that secret to

455
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:58,394
the main repository. So there are lots of things that you can or even for

456
00:29:58,432 --> 00:30:01,854
example, a nice thing that I seen is

457
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:05,630
that at the moment in time when a secret is identified

458
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,762
in a push or during the night scan automatically,

459
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:14,610
the system was able to regenerate the access

460
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,962
tokens and all the credentials for that

461
00:30:19,016 --> 00:30:23,554
service to ensure that the

462
00:30:23,592 --> 00:30:27,398
keys were not made public available to a

463
00:30:27,404 --> 00:30:31,174
third party. We talked about the kids,

464
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:35,202
now let's talk about yam policies

465
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:38,954
and Azure ad robust access control

466
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:41,722
because it's pretty important. And why?

467
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:45,446
Because using Azure site access signature or AWS

468
00:30:45,478 --> 00:30:49,260
signature together with them

469
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,842
we can have the power to limit

470
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:56,554
the access to anonymous users to our storage,

471
00:30:56,602 --> 00:31:00,954
to our system. And this combined with firewall rules.

472
00:31:01,082 --> 00:31:04,366
And please remember about the firewall rules

473
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,746
because almost all storage type services

474
00:31:07,848 --> 00:31:11,326
and also workload services have now the ability to specify

475
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:14,946
very simple firewall rules, at least to specify a

476
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:18,038
whitelist. What are the ips that are allowed to access?

477
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:21,814
And it's just a small step how you can create a

478
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:24,310
system that is more robust, more secure.

479
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,046
Now, talking about Azure role based access control, I think it's very

480
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:32,454
important in the moment in time when you're using Azure and you want to secure

481
00:31:32,502 --> 00:31:36,380
environment because as I said before, try to avoid to use

482
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,694
that master username and password that has

483
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:45,134
full access and also try to limit how

484
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:48,622
much a user have access or how much a specific service

485
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:52,838
have access to other services. If me radu

486
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:56,866
should have access only to

487
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,980
storage and only to a specific lambda or

488
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,474
Azure functions, then I should only have access to that one.

489
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:08,946
How I can do that? Well, when we're talking about Azure role

490
00:32:08,978 --> 00:32:12,246
based access control, we have three elements that we

491
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:16,386
need to be aware of. The first one is security principle.

492
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:20,566
A security principle basically is the entity that gets access can

493
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:23,942
be a person, can be a group, can be a service principle.

494
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:27,290
And what I like here to mention when you're talking about the service principle,

495
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:32,294
we are talking about a service Azure

496
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:36,490
function, an app service, a VM,

497
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,030
you call it a major identity is an identity that can be managed inside

498
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,746
it. You have a role, you're specifying the role, what kind of

499
00:32:43,768 --> 00:32:46,738
operation can be done, read, write,

500
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:51,330
delete, update and so on. And what is the scope?

501
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,266
Can be a subscription level, can be a resource group level, can be

502
00:32:57,288 --> 00:33:00,440
a resource level, only the storage or only

503
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:05,138
the VM. And what you're doing, basically you are doing a role assignment,

504
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:08,810
you are aligned, a security principle,

505
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,986
let's say a user that is part of

506
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:15,674
a specific group like development group.

507
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:18,726
You say what is his role? It is contributor.

508
00:33:18,838 --> 00:33:22,570
And to what? To a specific resource.

509
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,102
And by managing this in that way on long term you have

510
00:33:27,156 --> 00:33:31,022
better visibility about how you can access, how you can manage and

511
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:34,126
if you need to retire can access or to review who has access to what.

512
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:38,194
It's more simple to analyze how

513
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:41,826
a role was assigned to

514
00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:45,650
a group versus to take a look on each user,

515
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,862
how and what kind of actions he was able to do.

516
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:54,018
So remember all the time do duty segregation

517
00:33:54,114 --> 00:33:57,846
within your team, not at the team level, inside the team

518
00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:01,930
per different roles that people might have at the level or your team

519
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,594
specific all the time, the permission and

520
00:34:05,632 --> 00:34:09,466
don't provide more than they should have and try to

521
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:15,114
avoid to build that legacy

522
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:17,934
permission that they had in the past. For example,

523
00:34:18,052 --> 00:34:21,582
I was on project a, so should I still have access to project a anything

524
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:25,250
like that? And avoid to

525
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,578
provide access to specific resources to specific people,

526
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:33,794
try to create blocks and

527
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:37,254
try to group permission and resources in

528
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:40,520
such a way to be logical grouped per different,

529
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,054
if we can call them line of business,

530
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:49,562
what else we can do? We can secure our

531
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:53,386
public endpoints and to protect them through the

532
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:56,842
firewall. And sometimes firewall is not enough. More than we can do

533
00:34:56,976 --> 00:34:59,260
is that. For example,

534
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,874
Azure application Gateway has the ability to activate

535
00:35:04,922 --> 00:35:08,334
the WAF web app firewall. The WAF is

536
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:12,614
providing us a very fine and granular

537
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:14,900
control on who can access.

538
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,262
But not only that, but we have out of the shelf protection

539
00:35:21,406 --> 00:35:25,586
for oaps attacks at

540
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:29,910
the firewall level. At the application level means that

541
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,282
any kind of attack will be stopped here, will be audit,

542
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:37,174
will be locked and our workloads can

543
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:39,080
focus on their business.

544
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,506
The load on cpus when this kind of attacks will

545
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:48,266
be the same because everything is stopped at the application

546
00:35:48,368 --> 00:35:51,534
gateway level and we know that this

547
00:35:51,572 --> 00:35:55,610
is updated and is following all the recommendations

548
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,760
and best practices that are on the market.

549
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,826
How we can track, how can

550
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:07,940
I track it? Well, first of all,

551
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,660
sorry, what else we can do?

552
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,814
We need to ensure that default security features of cloud services are

553
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:20,840
active all the time. And sometimes,

554
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,842
even if they might be annoying, we shouldn't disable

555
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:29,930
them. What we should do, we should more

556
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,610
look on the best practices, look on the recommendation and try to follow them,

557
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,574
even if sometimes means that the investment

558
00:36:37,622 --> 00:36:41,274
that the cost is higher because implementing all the recommendation,

559
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:44,366
all the best practices cost us money. And one of

560
00:36:44,388 --> 00:36:52,122
the most common causes from what I've seen, that different security recommendations

561
00:36:52,186 --> 00:36:55,394
are not implemented is because of the cost in time and

562
00:36:55,432 --> 00:36:58,242
money, but especially from the time point of view.

563
00:36:58,376 --> 00:37:02,046
Okay, how we can track, how we can monitor

564
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:05,670
the first thing that we should do is to use Azure Security center,

565
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,086
even if you are using the

566
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:13,874
free tier. Why? Because it's offering us a security score

567
00:37:13,922 --> 00:37:17,462
to know exactly what is our score and where

568
00:37:17,516 --> 00:37:21,670
we could do the improvements.

569
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,754
Compliance information, especially from the catalyst service point of view,

570
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:29,466
we have the Azure Defender, that is the premium feature that

571
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:33,434
is very useful, especially when we integrate with the on prem system and also inventory.

572
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:38,666
But the most important thing is that it's providing us recommendations

573
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:42,686
and identify where we could have different security

574
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:46,466
issues. For example, if you don't have too

575
00:37:46,488 --> 00:37:50,594
much time, I just want to show to you exactly what security center can do

576
00:37:50,632 --> 00:37:54,274
for us. He can identify exactly where we

577
00:37:54,312 --> 00:37:57,810
have issues, where we might have different

578
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,910
data breach and what

579
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,294
we can do to improve that. Sometimes even

580
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:09,894
it come up with some recommendations and we can do automatically

581
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:13,814
fixed by triggering for example a logic

582
00:38:13,942 --> 00:38:18,010
app behind the scene and things like that. So with just a few clicks,

583
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,414
security center and Azure defender not only protect us,

584
00:38:22,532 --> 00:38:27,370
but is offering us mechanisms

585
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,846
to fix the problem that we have on top

586
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:34,466
of Azure security center. Just try to take

587
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:37,746
a look on Azure advisor because besides security,

588
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:41,346
Azure advisor can come up with recommendation about cost and

589
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:44,974
do cost optimization, how we can have

590
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:48,598
system more reliable and also how we can

591
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:53,282
improve our operational

592
00:38:53,346 --> 00:38:56,886
excellence. Also we need all the time

593
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:59,986
to track and monitor. We need to have the logs,

594
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:03,226
we need to have the metric, we need to keep them and to ensure that

595
00:39:03,248 --> 00:39:07,098
we are looking at them to analyze them. Now the tricky part here

596
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,446
is that where should I look for when I

597
00:39:10,468 --> 00:39:13,360
have different problem? First of all,

598
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,302
remember that we have information about

599
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:22,526
all the activity that the user has inside

600
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:25,966
the Azure. And I'm not referring here the activity that he's

601
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:29,714
doing when he access a website and things like that.

602
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:33,682
I'm referring more on the activity that the user is

603
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:37,762
having when he's doing or is changing different configuration.

604
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:41,382
So for example, if I would go here and I would add a new

605
00:39:41,436 --> 00:39:45,318
policy, let's say this

606
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:48,598
policy, this action would appear automatically

607
00:39:48,694 --> 00:39:53,050
here once the policy would be created

608
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,682
and nobody would be able to delete it,

609
00:39:56,816 --> 00:39:59,882
nobody from your team,

610
00:39:59,936 --> 00:40:04,320
from the subscription owner, or even from Azure, and will be kept there

611
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:08,446
for a specific period of time when you can go and access the data.

612
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:12,266
Another thing that you can do is to ensure that you are also logging

613
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:15,506
the events that are happening inside the system and the

614
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:20,306
process events and all this information can be used to

615
00:40:20,328 --> 00:40:24,206
track exactly what happened. But remember, you need to have the logs

616
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,320
and you need to keep them in a secure way.

617
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,510
Now for final thoughts.

618
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,934
Well, there are a lot of things that

619
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:39,706
we can do to improve our system and all the team, there will be more

620
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:43,866
things that we could do. But don't forget that

621
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:47,366
Microsoft is offering the cloud adoption framework for Azure

622
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:50,506
that has four different stages defined strategy,

623
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:54,590
plan, ready and adopt, but also is offering very

624
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,978
good support for governance, compliancy,

625
00:40:58,074 --> 00:41:01,726
control and secure. And that is the location where

626
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:05,266
we should analyze exactly what are the actions that we

627
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:08,510
should do to be aligned with all the security recommendations

628
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,690
at the moment in time when we do a cloud adoption.

629
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,334
Additional to this, we have the well architecture framework that

630
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:21,222
is coming with a list of recommendations, best practices and ways

631
00:41:21,276 --> 00:41:24,962
of doing things specific for specific industry

632
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:28,394
and business domains that can help us

633
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:36,314
to build a secure environment that

634
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:40,214
can be used without any kind of problem by our customers and can be managed

635
00:41:40,262 --> 00:41:44,222
easily by our teams without being afraid that they could open

636
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:48,430
a security hall and think similar like

637
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,826
that. Thank you. Thank you for joining this session. My name is Radhu Radu
