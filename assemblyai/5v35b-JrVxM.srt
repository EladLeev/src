00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,786
Hi, I'm Michael Davidson. I'm going to be speaking

2
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:52,050
about security domains, what they are,

3
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,334
why they're so important. I'm going to start with a bit of background

4
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,002
about myself because I think that will help explain my

5
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:03,794
passion for this topic. Nowadays I work as

6
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,514
a software architect at Dell, where I lead the

7
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:10,810
public cloud cybersecurity for youre

8
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,374
Powerflex product, which is a software defined storage

9
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:18,394
product. In the past, I've worked both as software architect and

10
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:21,998
a security architect at a number of different companies. Before that,

11
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:26,026
I was a software developer. I sometimes lecture academic

12
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:29,582
courses in cybersecurity and in

13
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:33,506
agile and software development methods. And the

14
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,646
reason I started thinking about why we need security domains

15
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,140
is because I was thinking,

16
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,746
why isn't there enough diversity in the field of cybersecurity? I think if you

17
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:49,254
look at security, for instance, if you look at women

18
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:52,918
in security, those are less women in the security field than are in

19
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:57,238
tech in general. And it's definitely not at 51%,

20
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:01,034
which is why I'd like to see. So I

21
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:04,474
started to think that this is happening because we're looking at

22
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:08,586
security as those single blob, those single thing of like either you

23
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:12,186
know security or you don't. Either you're a security expert or you don't.

24
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:15,758
And usually using a security expert was kind of

25
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:18,974
thought of as being a hacker. I mean, a white

26
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:22,458
hat hacker, someone who's doing it for a valid organization

27
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:26,514
and a legal purpose, but still someone who has that capabilities of

28
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:30,034
reverse engineering, of hacking. And I think when some of us

29
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:33,410
were seeing those films

30
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,098
and tv shows where youre see a teenager in the basement,

31
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:41,266
like tapping away a keyboard for two or 3 minutes and then breaking

32
00:03:41,298 --> 00:03:44,882
into these really impressive security systems like a bank

33
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:47,270
or the Mafia or the CIA or whatever.

34
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,634
So it could have us feeling like, okay,

35
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:54,250
I can't do this. So I guess this isn't the field

36
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,914
for me. And that's something that I want to change

37
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:02,266
because there's a love room for many diverse

38
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:06,186
perspectives in security with many diverse backgrounds.

39
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:10,094
I want to encourage all of you who are interested in security to

40
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:13,966
listen during this talk, see what fields you're interested in, what domains

41
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:17,982
within security are interested in, and then maybe that will help you pursue

42
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:22,334
your passion to become an expert in those specific security domains

43
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:26,034
without necessarily having the capabilities of

44
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:29,986
being a hacker. And we're also going to see later on how this whole hacking

45
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:33,846
thing of tap tap and you're in a system is a myth. So that was

46
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:37,606
my first motivation for this talk. I'm very passionate about increasing

47
00:04:37,638 --> 00:04:40,714
diversity in the field of cybersecurity. I write

48
00:04:40,752 --> 00:04:44,182
a blog on medium about developing your cybersecurity

49
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:46,570
career, your software architecture career,

50
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,710
the broken rung, which is something I find very interested

51
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,950
in and being able to help women promote their careers.

52
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,554
I also write there about software security and about software

53
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:03,650
architecture, zero trust cloud security.

54
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,694
So youre welcome to follow me there. Michael Davidson

55
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:10,994
at Miss Architect on medium. Another reason

56
00:05:11,032 --> 00:05:15,154
I thought this talk was so important was because we

57
00:05:15,192 --> 00:05:18,774
talk about security as a single thing. You're going to then not

58
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:22,934
necessarily know how to develop your career in security because

59
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:26,120
you're not going to necessarily know what paths to take within security.

60
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,362
And also in terms of creating community. Let's create communities around

61
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,220
these subdomains of software security instead of having like a general security.

62
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,698
General security conferences are great, but sometimes youre need to find

63
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,314
those niches and help those bloom. And they're not actually niches,

64
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:46,126
they're like pretty large industries with thousands of people working in

65
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:50,014
them. Just, we've never actually made that division that happens in other aspects of

66
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:53,514
computers, like you have hardware and software

67
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,830
in computers, networking, storage,

68
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,566
AI. And we need to, within security, stop kind of breaking

69
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:05,278
this up into different domains in order to create these communities

70
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:08,694
and networks, develop our careers. And also if you're looking

71
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:11,410
for talent instead of, I often see these titles,

72
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,074
security expert, security engineer, security architect,

73
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:18,566
and the title is going to be the same and then the listing underneath is

74
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:22,490
going to be like a whole different set of capabilities because you need to think

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,594
what is the expertise you're looking for? And zoom in on that

76
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:29,274
instead of finding a security expert who's really good at one thing and

77
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,842
doesn't really have background in something else. So that would help you

78
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,310
when you're searching for career expertise as well, or it

79
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,150
could help you say, hey, this is a field that's really interesting to me.

80
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,998
I may not think of myself as a security expert, but maybe this is a

81
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,022
field I'd like to learn or I want to give the opportunity to someone else

82
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:48,446
in my team to develop their expertise in that category.

83
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:51,410
And I think that's something that could really be impactful.

84
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,682
But from those technical point of view, I would say actually the most important

85
00:06:55,736 --> 00:06:59,158
part of this talk is developing holistic security, which means

86
00:06:59,244 --> 00:07:02,280
when you don't just think of one aspect of security,

87
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,966
you're not going to be in those situation where you really zone in. In one

88
00:07:06,988 --> 00:07:10,194
aspect, maybe one aspect of security, you know, well, personally, one aspect,

89
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:14,042
your customers are asking for federal compliance. That actually often

90
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,582
happens and you're going to say, you're just going to really put all your attention

91
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:20,890
there. You're going to have this door that's locked and bolted with like 20 padlocks,

92
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,360
security point of view, and then you're going to have a wide open

93
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,966
window next to it, which an attacker can easily get through. That's not what you

94
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:33,822
want to have happening. Instead, youre want to be going around your system,

95
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:37,634
which is kind of like going around your house from the outside and bolting every

96
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:41,442
single window and every single door and your garage door. Right.

97
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:45,474
And I think that's kind of thinking about security holistically. That's looking at every

98
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:48,934
single security domain and thinking, did I think about that?

99
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:52,360
Did I address that to have your holistically secure system?

100
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,822
So I did is I was thinking, okay, security is just like too

101
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,146
much of a single blob. I want to break it into domains.

102
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:04,214
Now, when I was thinking about it, I broke it into these six domains.

103
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:08,646
Now, you may come along and say, I don't agree, I want to categorize

104
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:12,086
it differently. I think there should be five domains or four domains or ten domains,

105
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:15,806
and I'm going to give them different names. That's fine, right? That's actually great.

106
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:19,486
What I'm trying to encourage here is this, thinking like, okay, security,

107
00:08:19,588 --> 00:08:23,006
let's break it down. Let's address all those different aspects. Let's understand

108
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:26,238
those are different domains with different knowledge, different background you

109
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:29,474
need to know and different things you need to think of. And that's the main

110
00:08:29,512 --> 00:08:32,434
message that I want to get across here. So I'm going to go through these

111
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:36,146
domains. If you afters want to, I'm actually really interested to hear how you

112
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,546
would split up the domains. If you want to drop me a note, I'd be

113
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,798
really interested in discussing that further. I wrote a few blog posts on

114
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:45,766
this. I'm always happy to update them with different ideas. The main

115
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:49,850
thing is we start thinking about how we break security into these domains.

116
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,726
I'm going to start with compliance because compliance

117
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:58,474
often gets the most attention and focus, often because

118
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:02,126
of money, right. We're trying to sell our products, and youre customers are

119
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:05,626
often asking, are you compliant? Are you compliant with SoC?

120
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:08,974
Are you compliant with ISO 27001? If your

121
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:14,266
customers provide federal

122
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:18,198
suppliers, then they often may need to be compliant with the federal program. Fed wrap.

123
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:22,174
There's also the executive order that came out relatively recently.

124
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:25,560
Youre also going to see compliance around specific

125
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,722
industries like the HIPAA for healthcare,

126
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:32,274
PCI, DSS for credit cards. Youre using to see compliance

127
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,522
around specific features and domains like GDPR

128
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:39,490
for privacy and the El for logging. But what's

129
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,106
unified about all these compliance is, first of all, they're third party standards

130
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:45,770
that we need to comply with. And that kind of leads us to the second

131
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,046
point, which is they have to be generic, right? They have to be a template

132
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:51,914
that any system can try and comply with.

133
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:55,326
Any system can work through that checklist. The result of

134
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:58,266
that is, first of all, is a lot of focus on the process, on creating

135
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:01,774
the process in your company. And the

136
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:05,378
second one is that because of that,

137
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:09,730
it's really impossible with this single generic compliance

138
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,506
requirement list to capture all the complexities of

139
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:16,902
your system. So it's going to capture a lot. Going through compliance is definitely

140
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:20,898
going to make your system, typically, unless you're already extremely

141
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:24,454
security conscious, but in most cases, going through compliance is

142
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,618
going to make your system more secure. But I don't

143
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:31,386
want you to think if your system is compliant, that means

144
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:34,710
your system is secure because there's always going to be that gap,

145
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,794
right? There's going to be that place. So the compliance didn't necessarily think of

146
00:10:38,832 --> 00:10:42,314
or address because it is this cookie cutter thing. And that's why

147
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:46,010
it really is important to think of compliance as just one aspect

148
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,014
of your security profile. In other words, it's not like, okay, I'm compliant with

149
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:53,486
either 27001, therefore I am secure. It's just our

150
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:57,378
way of being able to publicly state to the world and to our customers

151
00:10:57,464 --> 00:11:00,994
what process we went through. And I see that

152
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:04,494
kind of as the initial stepping stone. It's always good to also have that internal

153
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:08,660
understanding of your system to see where else you can improve it.

154
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,154
Now I'm going to speak about network security, which I

155
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:16,722
would say from the technical point of view is really what's been getting the most

156
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:21,014
attention in a long time. Because network

157
00:11:21,062 --> 00:11:25,174
security classically was about protecting

158
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:29,270
data centers on prem networks, on prem preventing

159
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,578
really physical network access, and then always checking

160
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:36,400
who is trying to gain access to my system.

161
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,714
That's the authentication, who are youre, who are, who is your device?

162
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:44,786
And then the authorization, which is the, what do you want? Do I want

163
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:48,274
to let you do this or not? Based on

164
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:51,762
that giving network access or giving

165
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:55,294
system access, right. That has evolved

166
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:58,882
in the last few years, I would say because of cloud security

167
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,546
and because of zero trust, which kind of came together. There's this concept,

168
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,070
okay, we can't just be asking who and what, but youre suddenly asking why?

169
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,446
Why are you doing this? And youre need to be constantly asking that. That's kind

170
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:12,490
of a big part of the zero trust principle.

171
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,930
You're not just saying who you are and what youre want, but like why?

172
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,478
And you constantly do this, why? And that way you're

173
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:23,802
hopefully, if there's a malicious attacker who maybe has stole someone's valid identity

174
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:27,630
or is doing something malicious, or maybe you have a malicious user who

175
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,582
is authenticated and is authorized for certain actions, but why are they doing this

176
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:35,566
kind of anomalous behavior? Maybe there's a risk here. Maybe there's a threat

177
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:39,374
here. By this constant automation, youre improving

178
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:43,214
the security of your system. So network

179
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,786
security has evolved, right? It's more than just the original

180
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:50,902
network protocols we learned about. We have the SSO piece, right? The single sign

181
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:54,022
on multifactor authentication, identity and access

182
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:57,674
management. Im is something that you often see critical in

183
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:59,260
cloud security.

184
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,690
Let's say the closed data center networks have kind of evolved into

185
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,034
a virtual private cloud in the cloud. It's those concept of this

186
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:13,200
network, even virtually, that you don't want others to gain access to.

187
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,518
Even things like firewalls, which youre going to see on permian, is he translated into

188
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:21,102
security groups on AWS. So there

189
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:25,290
is a huge amount of importance in network security.

190
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,914
You definitely have to be tackling your network security thinking

191
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:32,194
about this piece, which is really a lot more than the network security. It's also

192
00:13:32,232 --> 00:13:35,220
the identity and access management security.

193
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,398
But it's still not going to be 100% enough because I sometimes see

194
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:43,110
systems where let's say there's mutual tls, right,

195
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,634
and there's mutual authentication and using the latest protocol,

196
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:51,426
but then when you actually start analyzing the system, you're saying, okay, but this TLS,

197
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,046
right, is using a certificate with a key pair. How are you protecting

198
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:59,066
your private key? Can a malicious user actually come and steal your private key and

199
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,266
kind of spoof those tls or all these kind of points where

200
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,374
network security alone isn't enough. And like we're going to see, we're going to need

201
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,782
other aspects like cryptography too. So when you're putting

202
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:12,686
together the security of your product, maybe you're starting with a

203
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,266
compliance, you're speaking about the network security, but we're going to go on and see

204
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:19,586
other domains that matter. Too often people who are

205
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,022
experts in network security, they may be coming here with a security background

206
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:26,434
or a development background. They may be coming here with an IT background, which is

207
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:30,070
incredibly useful here. So there are really a lot of different ways

208
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,920
to kind of develop in the network security field.

209
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,994
Now I'm going to speak about monitoring. The idea of monitoring

210
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,538
is this automation of looking at

211
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:44,486
the system and seeing when someone is perhaps an intruder,

212
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:48,378
right? Maybe they're doing, you want to detect the intruders. Ideally you'd like to

213
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:52,550
prevent the intruders, and it's not going to be those static analyst analysis

214
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,630
of, okay, are you valid or are you not? You're going to need a learning

215
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,482
piece because you want to first see what is as typical

216
00:14:59,546 --> 00:15:02,698
behavior, and then you're going to be able to identify anomalies,

217
00:15:02,794 --> 00:15:06,126
what's unusual behavior? Maybe this is a threat, right?

218
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:08,866
Maybe this is a risk. It doesn't mean it is, but let's start looking at

219
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:12,866
it better. Let's start analyzing it. And what I find interesting about

220
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:16,680
the monitoring domain is it's an anomaly within itself.

221
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,722
Or in other words, most people who are experts

222
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:24,338
in developing and designing monitoring tools

223
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:29,134
are not going to be necessarily with a security background, rather with an AI background.

224
00:15:29,282 --> 00:15:32,522
Really useful nowadays, data science, machine learning,

225
00:15:32,656 --> 00:15:36,614
because those are really the key skills you need in order to develop these systems.

226
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:40,386
Now, yeah, they're going to be developing security monitoring systems

227
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:43,710
and definitely a lot of collaboration with security experts,

228
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,186
but often the expertise here is actually more from the machine

229
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:51,374
learning field. And monitoring is seeing a ton of

230
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:54,850
growth in the last few years, I would say, because of cloud security.

231
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,258
Just in general, like the scale of our deployments on

232
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:01,870
the cloud and the fast pace means that really those static

233
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,346
security review is not enough. You want to

234
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:08,786
have tools that are constantly monitoring as well. You don't want to rely on a

235
00:16:08,808 --> 00:16:12,374
single human being or even a few human beings. And because

236
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:15,986
of that, you need that automation, you need those capabilities and you need that monitoring.

237
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:19,798
So that's really developing. And if you look at cloud security, by the

238
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:23,242
way, a lot of what youre using to be seeing, that's kind of called cloud

239
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:26,826
security is using to be these monitoring tools developed for the

240
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:30,806
cloud, right, like CNAP and CSPM and CWPP,

241
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:34,014
the cloud workload protection. It's all

242
00:16:34,052 --> 00:16:37,230
about developing your systems the same way,

243
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,782
not the same, but similar to how you would on Prem with kind of

244
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,686
slightly different cloud constructs. But then on top of adding in

245
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,226
those security, these cloud monitoring tools to

246
00:16:48,248 --> 00:16:51,726
give you that extra level of protection.

247
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:56,190
So this is like a whole cool new developing domain with a lot of potential

248
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,734
where if you're interested in security and perhaps you're coming with a different

249
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:03,286
background like data science or AI or ML, this could be a great way for

250
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:06,598
you to kind of enter the security world. Now I'm

251
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:09,978
going to speak about cryptography. Cryptography is what initially kind

252
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:13,530
of drew me into security. I did a regular computer

253
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,098
science degree. I didn't even do a cryptography course. I didn't do

254
00:17:17,184 --> 00:17:20,538
security course. I'm kind of embarrassed to say that, but I

255
00:17:20,544 --> 00:17:24,522
really knew nothing about security when I started off my career as a software developer.

256
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:28,618
And then I started developing smart cards.

257
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:32,378
And through that I needed to understand what these smart cards

258
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:35,486
were doing. And I started to study cryptography.

259
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:39,186
And I discovered that from my point of view,

260
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,850
I thought it was like a fascinating field because youre taking

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,098
maths and it's not particularly complex paths.

262
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:50,994
As quantum cryptography evolves and elliptic curves

263
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:54,422
and stuff is getting more complex in general, you're taking these

264
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:58,426
mass concepts that really anyone can, with some kind of mass background can

265
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:02,138
understand, and you're using those to protect

266
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:05,020
the security of the whole world wide web. Right.

267
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,658
I thought that was amazing. And I just started learning more

268
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:13,226
and more about cryptography and liking it. So if you have

269
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:16,126
a math background, it doesn't need to be a very advanced math background, but just

270
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:19,534
if you maybe like paths, it's a great way to kind of work

271
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:23,246
in the field of security is cryptography. Youre often using

272
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,654
to see advanced mathematicians with pretty advanced

273
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:30,130
paths, backgrounds working in the field of cryptography.

274
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,146
And something I want to say to all of you is if you're interested in

275
00:18:34,168 --> 00:18:37,886
security or you're already working security and you don't have this crypto

276
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:41,206
background, I think it's a really great thing to have. Like there are a lot

277
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:44,870
of courses available online for free. I'm going to link to some at the end

278
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,374
and just understanding about private keys

279
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:52,038
and public keys and asymmetric cryptography, what asymmetric cryptography

280
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:56,300
is, what symmetric cryptography is, what's those difference between

281
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,970
encryption and decryption versus signing and verification?

282
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,094
Just kind of those basics are going to help you so much because

283
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:09,754
then when you look at protocols, security protocols like TLS and network

284
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:13,058
security, youre going to understand them much better, much more in depth. You're going to

285
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:17,330
be able to have a much more in depth conversation,

286
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,254
and I think that's really invaluable. So my recommendation

287
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:26,054
to everyone who's interested in security is to look at cryptography just

288
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,550
a little bit to get the introductory concepts.

289
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,822
Within cryptography, there are niche fields. And I called

290
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:36,594
out here embedded security, because embedded

291
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:40,780
security is its own field.

292
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,566
It really looks at the security of chips. Nowadays,

293
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:47,706
we have trusted execution environments. For instance, if you have

294
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,146
bring your own device, so you're going to have your smartphone, right,

295
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:53,834
with all your photos and everything. And you want to be able to install whatever

296
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:57,710
app you want there, and then you're going to have maybe youre employer's email account

297
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,890
there, and your employer wants to make sure their email is safe.

298
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,766
So then in those cases, maybe youre employer is going to be

299
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:08,942
utilizing, for instance, a trusted execution environment in your device

300
00:20:09,006 --> 00:20:12,770
to make sure that that specific area is running in a youre secure mode.

301
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,386
So there's a lot of work about those security of chips, the security of

302
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:19,554
runtime environments on chips secure boot,

303
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:23,126
which means validating every single stage of your software to

304
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:26,806
make sure it's trusted, because security is a lot about trust here. Can you

305
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:31,766
trust this application that's running? Can you make sure it's not created

306
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,810
by someone malicious and

307
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,366
embedded security, often people go there with a background in electrical

308
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:43,178
engineering, and then within electrical engineering, you can start getting into embedded

309
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:46,026
security, or you could come to it from a different security background,

310
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:49,070
but it's a really cool domain.

311
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,914
And crypto analysis is actually, I find the fun part of cryptography

312
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:57,646
because it's kind of trying to attack the cryptography and trying to figure out where

313
00:20:57,668 --> 00:21:00,594
the floors are, where you're going to break it. And there's that kind of cat

314
00:21:00,632 --> 00:21:04,114
and mouse game there that there is in general in security, which is another reason

315
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:07,346
I love security. Right. It's never going to be static. There's always going to be,

316
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:10,646
okay, this is the system we're designing in now. Let's try and

317
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:14,134
attack it and let's try and improve it. And security and

318
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,842
cryptography kind of go together because like I said before, if you're

319
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:21,434
using a security protocol, youre do need to be thinking about things like how

320
00:21:21,472 --> 00:21:25,622
do you protect your keys? How do you protect the cryptography that's

321
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:29,354
using those keys and putting the effort to think

322
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:32,842
about those are going to help you develop this more holistically secure

323
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:37,438
system. Now, security architecture is

324
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:40,526
those field that I love because it kind of pulls a lot of what we

325
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:43,726
discussed before together, right. You want to be thinking about a lot

326
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:47,026
of different aspects and thinking, okay, how do I create a

327
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:50,846
secure system? Many people, when they hear security architect,

328
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:54,020
they think of the security review process, because many products

329
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,358
have the security process where you look at the analyze the

330
00:21:58,364 --> 00:22:01,686
whole system, perhaps you do threat modeling and you try and

331
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,206
think where are the flaws, where are the vulnerabilities? How can I

332
00:22:05,228 --> 00:22:08,998
improve the security of those system? And what I want to say there is,

333
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:13,114
if you're doing, and I really hope you are, this security review process, please do

334
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:16,566
it as early as possible in the process so it can have the maximum impact

335
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:19,898
because what often happens is a company is going to come and do those security

336
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:23,466
review at the end, and at that point, maybe someone's going to come along with

337
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,990
this whole list of flaws, but the company is going to be like, okay,

338
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,878
we need to reduce it, right? We need to get this product to market.

339
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:33,886
We're going to postpone this list. Like, thanks for finding this all out, maybe in

340
00:22:33,908 --> 00:22:37,198
the next release, but it's not something we're able to tackle now.

341
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:40,226
And often the whole thing's been developed, so it's a lot more effort to change

342
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:43,922
it versus if you did security review right at the beginning of the process.

343
00:22:44,056 --> 00:22:47,586
It's also going to be less effort to make changes before development is

344
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:50,486
complete, and it's also going to give you more time to be able to make

345
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:53,718
these changes. So the same review with the same amount of

346
00:22:53,724 --> 00:22:56,822
effort invested in the review is just going to improve the security of your product

347
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:00,614
and have more impact if you move that to earlier in the development

348
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:04,442
cycle. But the other thing I wanted to add here was

349
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:08,086
security architecture could also be not necessarily just reviewing

350
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:11,702
a product, but developing a security product.

351
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:15,278
What's a security product? It could be a monitoring tool youre spoke about. It could

352
00:23:15,284 --> 00:23:18,110
be a new protocol for a new industry.

353
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,170
Sometimes security architects, security engineers are actually

354
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,026
looking at new products.

355
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,658
How do you, from the bottom up, design them

356
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,020
securely? And that's really interesting field.

357
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,066
And what you're going to usually do that is use these building blocks. Like we

358
00:23:36,088 --> 00:23:39,622
mentioned before, you're going to use the network security available when

359
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:42,998
possible. You're going to use the cryptography available when possible.

360
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:46,806
There's always this idea of don't spin your own crypto, which is

361
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:50,166
like, don't rely. It's always better to rely on cryptography that's been

362
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:53,850
tried and tested and validated rather than trying to invent the wheel.

363
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,962
But taking those building blocks together and then building something secure and making sure

364
00:23:58,016 --> 00:24:02,314
that it's not vulnerable to attack is something that is

365
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:04,590
a really interesting aspect. And domain.

366
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,326
Now, I those, I've shown you that there are so many different domains in

367
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,590
security and we haven't even touched on hacking and reverse engineering yet.

368
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,270
So if any of those domains interested you, maybe you have a background I mentioned,

369
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,826
maybe you're just interested in want to learn. I just want to start by

370
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:23,106
wishing you good luck because you see, it is possible to become a

371
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,890
security expert without necessarily knowing hacking.

372
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,298
Now, when I say hacking here, I'm obviously speaking about white hat

373
00:24:29,314 --> 00:24:33,334
hacking, which is legal hacking, when the

374
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:37,446
company is actually hiring those hackers to develop the

375
00:24:37,468 --> 00:24:40,874
vulnerabilities in their system because they'd rather they find out

376
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,938
and not malicious attackers. There's also pen testing, which kind

377
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:48,746
of ties in with the security review I mentioned before, where you're looking at

378
00:24:48,768 --> 00:24:53,098
the system and trying to analyze it kind of theoretically

379
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:56,986
to find the vulnerabilities. But I also want to speak about reverse

380
00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:59,680
engineering, because, like I said,

381
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,190
when you see these films of, like, okay, tap, tap, and you're in a system

382
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,694
and you're not able to do that, it can cause imposter syndrome.

383
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:11,218
So I personally was already kind

384
00:25:11,224 --> 00:25:13,666
of in the security field for a few years, and I felt, okay, I want

385
00:25:13,688 --> 00:25:17,346
to know how to do reverse engineering. And I

386
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:21,286
did actually study a bit. And what you discovered then was quite interesting if

387
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:24,194
you want to study it. First of all, there's, like, great resources, for instance,

388
00:25:24,242 --> 00:25:27,794
in cybery on how to do reverse engineering, there are tools

389
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:31,578
like IDa and Letty bug that can really help you look at

390
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,460
binaries, find passwords there,

391
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,330
find places where there are vulnerabilities.

392
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,306
But why discovered is there's a huge amount of time and patience discovered.

393
00:25:43,338 --> 00:25:46,590
It's really not that tapped up on the keyboard that you may be seeing.

394
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,914
And I'd like to compare it to Sherlock.

395
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:53,262
If anyone has read or seen where Sherlock needs

396
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:57,106
to take together this shredded stack of papers and

397
00:25:57,128 --> 00:26:00,322
piece it together very painstakingly to find out the message.

398
00:26:00,376 --> 00:26:03,982
So it shows him with this huge stack of shredded papers. It shows him sitting

399
00:26:04,046 --> 00:26:07,794
for like, 2 minutes. It actually shows him sitting with the papers. In practice,

400
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:10,294
he does it for like a week, and then at the end, he has this

401
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:14,966
message put together, and it's too boring to watch that whole thing.

402
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:18,546
So just kind of pulling

403
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:22,038
that into here. There's a huge amount of effort, time, and patience involved

404
00:26:22,054 --> 00:26:25,194
in hacking. So if you do see someone just run something in one,

405
00:26:25,232 --> 00:26:28,666
2 minutes and crack into a system, they're usually using it

406
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:32,046
off work that someone else did in order to put that

407
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:36,046
script together and actually find the vulnerabilities. So you shouldn't think that

408
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:40,142
if you're not able to do that, youre not able to be a security

409
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:43,706
expert. So, to summarize, we spoke

410
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:47,294
about these different domains. Youre could divide them differently.

411
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:50,754
I hope I was able to convince you that security is more than

412
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:54,274
one field. There are many subdomains there. They're all

413
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:58,182
interesting. Within your career, if you're interested in security,

414
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:02,306
you could continuously build your expertise in different domains,

415
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:05,414
and that means you're going to be able to, at the end, provide a much

416
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:08,634
more holistic security for your system. But it's really

417
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,930
okay just to start with one or two of the domains and develop

418
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,042
your expertise in those. I'm going to provide now

419
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,206
some resources. Like I mentioned, cryptography.

420
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,638
There's a great introduction to cryptography course on Coursera available

421
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:27,710
for free. There's a software security course which is more focused on applied cryptography.

422
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,046
We have here. Cyber is a great resource if you

423
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,970
are interested in ethical white hat hacking and penetration testing.

424
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,366
These are things that youre can learn. And there are some really interesting blogs

425
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,126
on medium. I personally really like cloud security guy on Medium's

426
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:48,386
blog because he really writes about what's developing in the cloud security field.

427
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:52,466
And Professor Bill Bulhanan speaks in cryptography in

428
00:27:52,488 --> 00:27:56,210
a very interesting and relatable way. I just

429
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,042
love if you follow my blog on Medium is Architect, where I speak about cloud

430
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:04,266
security and zero trust security and software architecture and

431
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:07,546
developing your career as a software architect. So I hope

432
00:28:07,568 --> 00:28:11,066
we can stay in touch and thank you. And thank

433
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,110
you to consolidate for this lecture.
