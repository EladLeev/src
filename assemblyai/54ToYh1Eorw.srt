1
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,238
Do you ever feel productive yet isolated with

2
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:32,678
your team working remotely? I want to share with you the simple ways

3
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:36,294
to create belonging within remote teams. Hey,

4
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:40,290
I'm Najeef from team land. So by now, everyone's used to working remotely,

5
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,846
and we're kind of in our second inning of remote work.

6
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:47,814
We have 80 plus people on a Zoom call, yet we

7
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:51,246
feel isolated. The loneliness aspect happens for

8
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:54,794
a lot of people. The question is, how do we get your remote

9
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:58,000
team to feel more connected than ever before?

10
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,474
Well, right now, the reason why people are choosing remote work is

11
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:06,770
they have to, because of COVID But why did people choose

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,574
remote work beforehand? As someone who's worked remotely

13
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:14,286
for eight plus years, some of the reasons

14
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:17,858
are flexible schedule, being able to work from anywhere,

15
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:22,134
no commute, spending time with family, and the ability to work

16
00:01:22,172 --> 00:01:25,830
from home. And because of that, our lives right now,

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,338
in the past year and a half got impacted because

18
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:32,714
majority of the companies now want to continue a form of

19
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:36,540
remote work post pandemic. And because of that,

20
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:41,046
talent as well. People want to continue a form of remote

21
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,302
work, and a third will just flat out quit if they're forced to work

22
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:46,960
remotely in the office full time.

23
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,102
Working remotely leads to higher productivity and job

24
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:54,706
satisfaction. I mean, it sounds good, but what are the

25
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:58,750
challenges? Well, for one, the two of the biggest

26
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,190
downsides and struggles of working remotely is collaboration

27
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,406
and loneliness. These two encompass 40% of

28
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:09,766
the challenges, not including being in a different time zone than your

29
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,930
teammates. We're connected every minute,

30
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,582
yet still feel isolated. We have slack project

31
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,274
management tools, video conferencing tools, notifications,

32
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:24,026
and yet we feel difficult to connect casually with others.

33
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:27,926
Now, it's not necessarily the tech, but without the proper use of tools, we're feeling

34
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,786
left alone. Now. Managers don't have it easy as well. When asked managers

35
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,710
what they struggle with, 70% struggle with maintaining company

36
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,166
culture and team cohesiveness. So what

37
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:42,702
do we do? Well, first thing, the bad News first

38
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:46,334
is that creating belonging isn't a one and done activity.

39
00:02:46,462 --> 00:02:49,682
In fact, it's like farming or working out. Now,

40
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,482
the good news is that just like working out,

41
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:55,874
it takes time. But there are also different ways of doing.

42
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:59,586
So. If you look at the four stages of a team, forming,

43
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:03,110
storming, norming, and performing, you want to address

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,742
each aspect differently. When you're starting at a company or the

45
00:03:06,796 --> 00:03:10,390
team is afforming, you want to look at how are you onboarding everyone

46
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,850
now? Before it used to be, hey, we just go out for a happy hour,

47
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,174
but now it has to be done purposefully. Whether it's activity,

48
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:21,006
employee led or company led activities. Now, when it

49
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:24,734
comes from storming, it's conflict resolution that

50
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:28,766
impacts a belonging and it's related to having

51
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:32,046
empathy and understanding, whether it's coming from the manager or the

52
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:35,570
HR. Now, the other aspect of norming is

53
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,106
cooperation, entertainment, deepening relationships. Now, these can

54
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:43,022
happen both synchronously and asynchronously, and by creating

55
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:46,606
shared experiences through activities. That is what creates

56
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:50,070
bonds, whether it's something as simple as playing trivia or doing

57
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,542
a virtual escape room. Keep in mind, they're not all the same.

58
00:03:53,676 --> 00:03:56,918
You want to make sure that it's truly what builds trust

59
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:00,038
when spending time, when it's done effectively.

60
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:03,750
Now lastly, performing and this is where motivation,

61
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,386
recognition, self fulfillment comes into play. And these

62
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:10,842
are balanced of both intrinsic and extrinsic. If these are not

63
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:14,494
looked after, it can lead to burnout. And this is where

64
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:17,934
giving praise, affirmation, rewards helps, but not on the surface level.

65
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:22,186
On the deep down aspect, one of the interesting quotes

66
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:25,614
that I heard from one of the events that we've hosted is I like

67
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:29,006
this party because there's no pressure to drink or dance or dress

68
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:32,334
up. We have to realize that people, we're all in this shared struggle,

69
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:36,558
yet we have to make it work uniquely for each employee. Whether it's

70
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:39,814
a virtual cooking class, a yoga, meditation, or a weekly games night.

71
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:43,094
There are a lot of options, but what do you do?

72
00:04:43,212 --> 00:04:46,614
I get this question from a lot of managers. What team

73
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:50,242
building activities should I do? It always starts with the goal.

74
00:04:50,306 --> 00:04:53,142
Do you want to get to know others casually? Do you want to have cooperation,

75
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,698
motivation or entertainment? Once you know that, you can

76
00:04:56,784 --> 00:05:00,554
figure out other options. And it can take something like five to

77
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,026
10 hours a month to doing it. But doing it allows

78
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:07,694
you to improve the productivity, mental health and well being

79
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:11,582
of companies, because that's what's needed. If you want to learn some more

80
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:15,102
