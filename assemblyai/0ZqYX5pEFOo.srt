1
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,014
You. Let's go ahead and dive into what

2
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:32,486
cost and resource optimization actually is. We're going to be diving into the

3
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,702
theoretical piece of it first, and then we're going to get a little bit hands

4
00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:39,334
on and see a couple of tools that can help us with this. All right,

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,950
so, first things first. Why should engineers care about saving

6
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,470
money? Don't we have unlimited resources? Well,

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,526
no. Well, yes and no. Let's just dive into that.

8
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:53,838
First things first. Why should engineers care about money now?

9
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:57,822
It's actually funny and ironic to me when finops and the whole

10
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:01,534
cost optimization thing started coming out, because I can

11
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:05,146
remember going back ten plus years as

12
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,326
a sysadmin, even in the help desk space when I was setting up desktops

13
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:13,106
and laptops and stuff like that, we always had to care about the

14
00:01:13,128 --> 00:01:16,974
finances. In fact, we typically worked pretty closely

15
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:20,370
with the finance teams to say, okay, we have this budget.

16
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,226
We can't buy this. No, we have to change this spec, et cetera. So it's

17
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:28,454
actually ironic that a lot of it already works with finance teams.

18
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:32,140
And funny enough, there are a few.

19
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,714
I wouldn't say a lot, but there are some organizations where

20
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:41,126
the director of it, for example, will report to

21
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:45,214
the CFO. I've seen that a couple of times. So they're definitely in

22
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:49,278
conjunction pretty well. And I would say it

23
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:53,366
has always been this thing where it didn't make money, it always spent

24
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:57,234
money. I think that mindset is definitely shifting in

25
00:01:57,272 --> 00:02:01,250
today's world, especially since it's obviously technology driven.

26
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,726
Of course it is. I guess I'm dating myself here. I have some gray hair

27
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,350
on the sides, if everybody has already noticed that. So, yes,

28
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,962
we should care about money. We should care about saving costs.

29
00:02:13,026 --> 00:02:16,726
But I want to be very clear here. Even though

30
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:20,390
we want to care about saving money, we should not do that

31
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,026
if performance is degradating. Now, what do I mean by

32
00:02:24,048 --> 00:02:27,466
that? For example, let's say you have three worker nodes running and

33
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:29,786
you want to save money. So you're like, oh, I'm going to scale down to

34
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:33,146
one. No, don't do that, because it's going to mess up performance on the

35
00:02:33,168 --> 00:02:35,902
cluster. So you want to make sure that you're saving money, but at the same

36
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,706
time, you don't want to be saving money if it's messing

37
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:42,878
up your environment. Now, the next thing is,

38
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:46,538
don't we have unlimited cloud resources? Well, on prem, we know that we don't

39
00:02:46,554 --> 00:02:49,738
have unlimited resources. If you want an extra server,

40
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:52,226
you got to go get one. You got to talk to your reseller. It's got

41
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:54,818
to get shipped, it's got to be configured, it's got to be put in the

42
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:58,422
data center operating system, yada yada, blah blah blah. But in the cloud, no,

43
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:02,226
we still don't have unlimited resources. There are limits in regions,

44
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:05,586
there are caps. I forget exactly what region

45
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:09,100
it was, but I would say about a month ago or so,

46
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,626
I believe it was the azure storage account service, it ran out

47
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:17,306
of storage. So in one of the regions you

48
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:20,522
couldn't create a new storage account or

49
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,690
add stuff to a storage account. So yeah, no, we don't have unlimited resources.

50
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,182
So when it comes to resource optimization, really what we care about

51
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:31,518
here is to ensure that what's running is needed,

52
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:35,086
is necessary. For example, if you have 20 worker

53
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:39,300
nodes and you've never had to use more than six,

54
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,746
well you probably don't need an extra ten. You should keep

55
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:47,202
an extra couple around just for scalability purposes, just in case

56
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,806
you have a spike and it goes up to seven or eight. But from a

57
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:54,678
resources optimization perspective, you want to ensure that what you're using

58
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:58,498
actually makes sense in your environment. Because if it doesn't, whether it's from

59
00:03:58,524 --> 00:04:02,058
an application perspective, whether it's from a cluster perspective, whether it's from a

60
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:05,642
network, from a storage perspective, if you're just spending money and

61
00:04:05,696 --> 00:04:09,718
overalllocating resources or underallocating resources

62
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:13,118
for no reason, you're going to have a problem there.

63
00:04:13,204 --> 00:04:16,890
Now, speaking of under allocating resources,

64
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,722
that's where scalability can come into play for both overutilizing

65
00:04:21,866 --> 00:04:25,466
and underutilizing. So from a resource optimization perspective,

66
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,026
with scalability, I feel like we kind of always go to the, like we

67
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:31,566
need to scale up. We need to scale up. Yeah, we need more nodes.

68
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:35,442
Yeah, we need the ability to scale up, et cetera. But there's also the thing

69
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:39,110
of scaling down, and you want to be able to scale down as well.

70
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,158
That's arguably just as important as scaling up because guess what?

71
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:46,760
Maybe you're in peak season, maybe you're an ecommerce site,

72
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,774
cyber Monday, got to scale up. Maybe you need an extra two,

73
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:53,898
three worker nodes. But guess what, six months out of

74
00:04:53,904 --> 00:04:56,598
the year, eight months out of the year, you don't need those two extra worker

75
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:59,754
nodes. So because of that, you want to scale those things back down.

76
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,354
Otherwise you're spending money for no reason. So cost and resource

77
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:07,486
optimization both kind of come into play with each other. Now, speaking of

78
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:11,326
cost optimization, don't spend if you don't have to.

79
00:05:11,428 --> 00:05:15,366
That's arguably the biggest thing that I'll say, don't spend unless

80
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,900
you absolutely have to. There's no reason for it,

81
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,254
you're going to lose budget, people are going to be angry,

82
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:25,998
all that fun stuff, nobody wants to deal with it. So when it comes to

83
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:29,926
cost optimization, ensure that what you're spending makes sense.

84
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:34,034
Ensure that your resources are optimized. Because guess what? If your resources

85
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,754
are optimized, cost optimization is pretty much just doing its

86
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:41,340
thing in the background anyways. So you're good there.

87
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,594
All right, so now there are various tools in this space.

88
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:50,214
There's cast AI for cost optimization, resource optimization, there's Stormforge,

89
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:54,202
there's Cisivio, there are even cloud specific tools in AWS

90
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:58,234
and GCP and Azure for all of this cost and resource optimization.

91
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,934
Now we can't go into every single tool here, but I want to pick

92
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:05,438
out two for you, Socivio and Stormforge. And we're going

93
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:08,834
to see what both look like because one is more of

94
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:12,434
a managed service, like a SaaS in a sense, and then the other one is

95
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,226
you're actually managing it yourself. So let's kind of see how both of

96
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:19,838
those work here and we'll dive into our Kubernetes cluster. So the first that we'll

97
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:23,158
take a look at is Socivio. So what you want to ensure is you want

98
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:26,198
to have at least two nodes running, right?

99
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:28,038
So the first thing that you're going to want to do is you're going to

100
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:31,398
want to go to the download page and then what's going to happen is you're

101
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:34,746
going to get an installation based on your operating system.

102
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:38,710
So there are installations for Mac, Linux boxes,

103
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,590
windows, et cetera. Right. So I'm on a Mac.

104
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,358
So I've actually already brought the installation down. But what I could do is

105
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:49,326
I can tar it and then I can actually run the installer. So if

106
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:52,810
I CD into cost and resource optimization,

107
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,050
I see that I actually have that installer right here.

108
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,300
So I'm literally just going to go ahead and run it.

109
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,114
As we can see, we get some terminal output, we have the ability to

110
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:07,810
choose where we're running. So in this case I'm on an aks cluster,

111
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,120
but if you're not, totally fine, of course.

112
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,360
Next I'm going to choose my cluster name.

113
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:18,802
All right, we'll use the default. Now in production

114
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:22,486
you're going to want to set your domain suffix, but in this case this is

115
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,738
a demo environment so I don't care, I'm just going to do example.

116
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:29,238
We're not going to hit it from that domain anyways. Of course. And what we're

117
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:32,582
going to see here is it's going to do the full installation,

118
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:35,830
it's going to connect to the environment and then we're going to have the ability

119
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,118
to see it via the UI. So let's go ahead and just give this a

120
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:42,158
few minutes here and we can see that that was installed here. So what we're

121
00:07:42,164 --> 00:07:45,710
going to do is we're going to use the Kubectl port forward command.

122
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,046
All right? And then we're going to go and we're going to hit this URL.

123
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,154
All right? And then if I just go back to vs code here really quick,

124
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:55,954
this is the password that we're going to use to log in for the first

125
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:59,190
time. So admin and password.

126
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,534
All right. And then if I zoom in a little bit, we can now see

127
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:05,814
that Susivio is installed. Now, again, want to just

128
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:09,266
point this out here. This is a managed tool that you're

129
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:12,522
managing. It's not SaaS, it's not managed for you. It's really

130
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,262
awesome and I love it and it's great and it has a lot of capabilities

131
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:20,138
as we can see here. But you do have to manage it yourself.

132
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:24,030
So definitely do just keep that in mind when you're getting this thing

133
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,834
up and running. All right. Now the next tool is Stormforge

134
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,102
and this is going to be a tool that's more

135
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:34,498
SaaS based. So you're just going to log into a portal. So I'm going

136
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:38,420
to go ahead and type in my environment name.

137
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,874
All right? And as we can see here,

138
00:08:42,072 --> 00:08:45,522
we're going to go ahead and we're going to copy those

139
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:49,398
helm values. What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to vs code

140
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:53,250
here, I'm going to create a values

141
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,240
yaml file. All right, I'm going to paste it in,

142
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,322
I'm going to click continue and then I'm going to go ahead

143
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:04,586
and I'm going to install

144
00:09:04,768 --> 00:09:08,314
via helm. Now I am going to make

145
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:12,430
this change here because I just called the values file. Values yaml.

146
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,618
All right, let's go ahead and run that and then we'll

147
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:20,174
wait for our helm chart to install all

148
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:23,886
the way it was deployed. But I'm sure there's

149
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:26,914
some resources still coming up.

150
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:29,618
Let's go ahead and check that. Oh,

151
00:09:29,704 --> 00:09:32,900
sorry, Stormforge system.

152
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,122
All right. And as we can see, pods are still initializing and all that fun

153
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,438
stuff. So it'll probably take a few minutes and then we'll be able to

154
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:43,958
see everything in the portal, but we can just do a verify install

155
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:47,266
here really quick. All right, we can see that that was installed successfully.

156
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,582
Maybe it took like 15 seconds or so, 1015 seconds.

157
00:09:50,646 --> 00:09:54,634
So we'll click finish were, and then as we can see

158
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:58,618
here is our portal. So we have everything from what's currently

159
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:02,254
being used, what we can optimize our

160
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:05,722
cluster information, the efficiency around our clusters

161
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:09,658
and around our namespaces. Again, total current request,

162
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:13,470
total optimized request. There's nothing going on here because this is just a demo

163
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,026
cluster, right? But we can see all of our information here

164
00:10:17,128 --> 00:10:20,274
based on cluster, based on namespace, which is really

165
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,874
cool, and then based on workloads that are running, we also

166
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:27,286
have this optimize pro capability, which this

167
00:10:27,308 --> 00:10:31,190
is more of a paid piece here. Stormforge is a paid

168
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,710
tool in general, and then we can

169
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,690
click on that performance button and we can create some new performance

170
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,054
testing, which is pretty cool. It's like benchmarks if we

171
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:45,654
want to. All right? And those are two tools that we

172
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:49,286
can use in cost and resource optimization to ensure that our

173
00:10:49,308 --> 00:10:52,430
environments are running as expected. Again, we have one tool,

174
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,026
Stormforge SAS managed for you costs

175
00:10:56,058 --> 00:10:59,678
money. And then we have Socivio, we can use it out of

176
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:03,470
the box. We do have to manage it ourselves. And with that,

177
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,766
thank you so much for joining me today, really do appreciate it and I hope

178
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:07,610
that you enjoyed the session.
