1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,838
You on the road to conquering the world.

2
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:33,382
You need to regress or get in touch with your inner child

3
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:36,694
to make progress. I know what you're thinking right

4
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:39,494
now. Do I want to conquer the world?

5
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:42,934
Of course you do. And now you might be

6
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:47,080
thinking, but my inner child is pretty messed up.

7
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,306
Totally fair. Mine two. But your inner

8
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:54,030
child is also incredibly wise.

9
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,646
They know how to fall down and get back up,

10
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:00,720
how to be brave, how to play,

11
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,406
and how to explore and be curious. I'm rain

12
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,766
Leander, developer advocate with cockroach labs.

13
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:12,254
And today I would like you to use a child's

14
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:15,974
mindset for growth, to embrace your inner child,

15
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:19,302
to become the beautiful unicorn I know you are,

16
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:21,960
and yes, to conquer the world.

17
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,040
Who here knows how to ride a bike? Raise your hand

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,174
if you're in the Netherlands. You've known how to ride a bike possibly

19
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:34,586
since birth. But most of us learn at some point in

20
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:36,890
our childhood. Unless you haven't.

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,534
Unfortunately, if you don't learn how to ride a bike when you're a child,

22
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:45,342
it is infinitely harder to learn. And not because

23
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,910
our brains have shifted, but because at some point,

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,080
some shitty person laughed when we fell down.

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,650
And we develop this aversion to failure.

26
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,098
We don't want to fall. We don't want to mess up.

27
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:04,130
We don't want to be embarrassed. And when we're trying

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,022
something new, we wants to instantly be the

29
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:11,206
best. I've got news for you.

30
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:14,760
When you're trying something new, you will not be the best.

31
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,366
You are not a secret ninja if you have never taken any ninja

32
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:22,858
training classes. You will not win the Tour de France if

33
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:26,540
you've never learned to ride a bike. But you could,

34
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,780
as long as you get back up.

35
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,854
Because it is absolutely guaranteed that you will fall down.

36
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:37,646
You will fail, you will mess up, you will

37
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:42,458
make mistakes, and that is beautiful and

38
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:45,394
totally fine. Fall down.

39
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:49,140
It's part of life. And then get back up,

40
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,530
child. I am asking you to embrace your inner child today.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,262
Maybe this analogy doesn't fit as well as the rest,

42
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:01,826
because bravery is not something we're born

43
00:03:01,858 --> 00:03:05,346
with. It's something we develop. And from what I've

44
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:08,666
seen with a seven year old and a pair of four year

45
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,730
olds, children are not the bravest creatures.

46
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,146
Because becoming brave is hard. Sometimes it

47
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:20,750
feels impossible. Being brave

48
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,278
is not a lack of fear. It's moving

49
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:28,590
forward despite that fear.

50
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,122
But if it's overwhelming, here are some baby steps. Two.

51
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:35,330
Becoming more brave.

52
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,210
Embrace that vulnerability.

53
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,570
Admit you have fear.

54
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,102
Do it anyway. And when you fall down,

55
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:49,382
get back up. Nothing is

56
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:52,854
impossible. Every big scary monster or

57
00:03:52,892 --> 00:03:56,802
dragon or problem can be broken down into manageable,

58
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,820
bite sized pieces. And the key is to start.

59
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,834
Listen to that fear inside of you.

60
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,020
Acknowledge it. Admit it.

61
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,400
Take a few minutes to make a plan and then do the plan.

62
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,350
Just in case you're one of those skeptics who doesn't believe

63
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,982
in the importance of play, I'd like to introduce you to

64
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:26,338
the National Institution for Play, which gathers research

65
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:29,854
from diverse play scientists and practitioners to prove

66
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:34,270
that play is good for your physical and mental health. It increases

67
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,042
harmony and effectiveness of relationship, it optimizes

68
00:04:39,106 --> 00:04:42,066
learning and it encourages innovation.

69
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:45,830
How many here now want to become a play scientist?

70
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,654
When we're children, play is built into our daily

71
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:55,690
structure. But as we get older, there's less recess, no more

72
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,410
breaks, and fewer naps,

73
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,670
which is bullshit. These moments of play,

74
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,210
of engaging in activity for enjoyment and recreation

75
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:10,298
rather than a serious or practical purpose,

76
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:14,334
are instrumental to enjoying life. Two becoming

77
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:17,220
a unicorn and to conquering the world.

78
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,986
Now, sadly, I can't tell you how

79
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:25,494
two play. This depends entirely on

80
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:29,560
you. What you enjoy doing for fun. Do that

81
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,782
when it's not fun anymore, it's time to find a new fun

82
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:36,950
thing to do. Now, sure,

83
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,146
I can give you some ideas like baking cookies and

84
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:45,130
sharing them with me. But most

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,686
importantly, book the time on your calendar and

86
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:51,840
these go play.

87
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,166
It is absolutely possible to live your life sitting in

88
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:02,382
your room doing the same thing day in and day out.

89
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:03,860
But why?

90
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,162
Im so glad you asked. Literally from

91
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:14,238
birth, people are explorers, exploring surroundings,

92
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,410
environment, relationships, limitations,

93
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,854
potential. And what does this do? And how does that work?

94
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,960
And what happens if I do this?

95
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,880
To stop exploring is to stop being true to yourself.

96
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,910
And the key to exploration is to stay curious.

97
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,090
Curiosity pushes you to explore, yes, but also

98
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,860
to network, to solve problems,

99
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,990
to recognize and take advantage of opportunities,

100
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,520
and to lead a happier life.

101
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,822
But how? There are many

102
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,422
paths to achieve an exploration

103
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:56,210
can explorer's mindset.

104
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,570
Mine includes being curious,

105
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,980
listening a lot,

106
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,600
ask questions a lot,

107
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,760
avoid dysfunction, listen.

108
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,878
Embrace learning as fun. Develop a

109
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:19,126
beginner's mind. And please don't forget

110
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:20,380
to listen.

111
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,690
Here's a little secret. Come closer,

112
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,170
a little closer.

113
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,440
You are a unicorn already

114
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,174
this label unicorn is a euphemism for

115
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:43,940
being unique and fabulous and extra. And you.

116
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,746
And if Dr. Seuss is to be believed, no one in

117
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:51,540
the world is youer than you. And they're right.

118
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,086
All of the experiences you've had in your lifetime, your education,

119
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:59,494
your background, your ups, your downs, whatever brought you here to

120
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:03,382
this talk today at this conference, no one

121
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:06,920
else has that reality. Your experience,

122
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,682
your truth, your existence and

123
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:14,042
understanding. That is what makes

124
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:15,770
you a unicorn.

125
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,794
The neat part about all of this is if you follow those other steps,

126
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:26,366
you will conquer the world. It's inherent in

127
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:30,222
the steps. Be willing two fall down and get back

128
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,590
up. Be brave,

129
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,086
play, explore and be

130
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:40,522
curious. Be the beautiful unicorn

131
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,806
I know you are and you will conquering the

132
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:46,920
worlds. It thank you.

133
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,890
Many thanks to comp 42 python

134
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,910
organizer, organizers and sponsors.

135
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,726

much.
