1
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,646
Thank you for joining me for my talk. I want to go over some

2
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:48,386
of the aspects of incidents response that maybe you haven't

3
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:52,174
thought of before, as well as talking about different ways that companies can

4
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:55,310
organize their approaches to incident response.

5
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,838
Taking a cue from a popular narrative approach, let's start

6
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:03,502
in the middle of the story. It was a calm,

7
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:08,238
dark night, and our hero was fast asleep

8
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:12,420
when all of a sudden the pager went off.

9
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,654
Now, when the pager goes off,

10
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:21,414
what normally happens? Typically it will

11
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:25,078
bring in a technical responder. It's going to go to a service

12
00:01:25,164 --> 00:01:28,298
team person who's on call for problem

13
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:31,962
service and was needed. That person

14
00:01:32,016 --> 00:01:36,060
might bring in additional resources, call a colleague, call a friend,

15
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,974
and try to get these problem solved,

16
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:43,374
especially if it's happening during the daytime or business hours.

17
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:46,702
It's very common that they'll recruit other folks into

18
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:50,814
the event with them. So what

19
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:54,910
will these folks do when they join the incident bridge,

20
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,274
call, channel, whatever it is that they're using

21
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:02,482
as a communications method. Perhaps they're even in a physical situation room

22
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:05,926
and working together to solve this. I want to

23
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:08,610
introduce you to a concept called the Ooda loop.

24
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,842
OOda observe, orient,

25
00:02:11,986 --> 00:02:16,274
decide, and act. This is a fundamental

26
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:19,866
approach that's going to give us a way to

27
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:23,514
look at what everybody's doing along the was of

28
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:27,286
handling an incident. They're going to start with observing,

29
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:30,554
seeing what signals are available to them,

30
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:34,334
what's happening, and what does the system tell them about what is

31
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:37,674
happening after that? They're going to try to orient,

32
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:41,054
they're going to make sense or try to make sense

33
00:02:41,172 --> 00:02:45,122
of what these signals mean to enrich their observations with

34
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:48,514
context. What's been deployed recently, what other

35
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:51,700
changes do they know may or may not have been going on?

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,006
Then they're going to have to make a decision. They're going to

37
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:59,346
have to evaluate their response options, pick an approach,

38
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,434
and then ultimately act, execute the decision,

39
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:05,766
and in turn, repeat look at

40
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:09,286
what effect their action has. Orient as far as what

41
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:13,402
that means, make new decisions and new actions. Each person

42
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:17,500
is going to be doing this individually as well as the group doing it together.

43
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,014
So what is it that they're doing? They're doing

44
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:25,566
diagnosis. They're figuring out what is happening,

45
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:29,614
figuring out what to do, and figuring out what can be done

46
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:33,294
about what it is that's going on with the goal,

47
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:37,026
ultimately of therapy. They want to take action to

48
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:40,174
mitigate the issue and to ensure that the action

49
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:44,126
was effective. So what's missing

50
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,606
from this picture? Let's back up just a little bit because

51
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:51,446
I ran a little bit fast. Going through all of this with

52
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:55,474
these initial responder engaged the person who receives

53
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:59,030
the page. I glossed over the work of recruiting

54
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,750
additional people, and the role of incident commander

55
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,658
is often one that doesn't fit well on the shoulders of a

56
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,366
technical responder. This work of

57
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:15,194
getting the right people involved is something that can be handed

58
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:18,762
over, and often is to a role that's known as incident

59
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:22,814
commander or incident coordinator. I use incident commander because

60
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:26,066
it's kind of the traditional term. How does

61
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:29,250
the IC themselves get engaged?

62
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,666
It could be that the technical responder throws up a flare and

63
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:37,320
says, hey, I need an incident commander to help me out here.

64
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,442
Or it could be that the pager maybe calls the incident

65
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:44,742
commander, either initially and

66
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:48,522
they bring the technical responder in or at the same time

67
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:52,394
as the technical responder is paged in

68
00:04:52,432 --> 00:04:56,742
return, then the incidents commander can work on recruiting

69
00:04:56,806 --> 00:05:00,750
the additional people that are needed to help out in the scenario.

70
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,370
With a multitude of people involved, even if it's

71
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,002
just three or four, there is coordination

72
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:12,640
that's needed. Who does what and when?

73
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,220
Who's in charge? Well,

74
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,100
these are where the organizational models come into play.

75
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,794
So we've got this structure right now.

76
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:27,554
We've got a technical responder that's engaged with technical

77
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:31,622
compatriots. We have an instant commander who's looking

78
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:35,606
over things. We also have in

79
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:39,546
any incident, other concerned people,

80
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:42,826
these might be executives, they could be

81
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:46,090
managers, they could be customers. If this is a customer

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,946
impacting incidents, they want updates. They want

83
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,550
to know what's going on with an incident commander.

84
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,202
They know who to talk to because they are the designated

85
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:01,966
contact. But sometimes there's so much work going on and so

86
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:05,506
many things to coordinate within the response team,

87
00:06:05,688 --> 00:06:09,550
that delegating that communication role to a communications

88
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,090
lead can really help out the incident commander.

89
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:18,058
So this covers the spectrum roughly,

90
00:06:18,174 --> 00:06:21,318
in very functional terms of the work that needs to

91
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:25,270
be done. Diagnosis therapy

92
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,782
in the technical realm, recruiting and communication

93
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:33,158
in the logistical or administrative realm, and coordination,

94
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:34,700
bringing it all together.

95
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,050
This is for functional approach. How do you organize

96
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,042
this, and how do teams typically approach,

97
00:06:44,106 --> 00:06:48,538
or companies typically approach, structuring the way that people respond

98
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:52,078
to incidents? Let's map this functional model

99
00:06:52,164 --> 00:06:55,090
into kind of an organizational approach.

100
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,330
So there's one approaches that I teams, the one at a time,

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,730
or the pass the baton method.

102
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,178
The page comes in to team a. Perhaps these is

103
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:09,640
an alert that was triggered on a service that's owned by team a,

104
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,014
and team a looks into it, and they decide our

105
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:18,230
system is doing the right thing. It must be because team

106
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,258
b's system is giving us bad data,

107
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:24,906
or returning an error or something like that, or not returning at all.

108
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:29,020
So they pass the baton to team b, who in turn

109
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,462
looks at it, passes it to team c, and ultimately

110
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:36,878
they decide, ah, it's got to be the DNS, so we'll pass it to the

111
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:39,360
DNS team. Since that starts with a d,

112
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,466
the problem, or one of the problems with a one at a time pass the

113
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:48,226
baton method, is that where does the

114
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:50,420
incident commander come from?

115
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,914
We've passed the responsibility from team a to b

116
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:58,854
to c to d. What happens if team D finds that

117
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:02,454
their problem is actually caused by something back on

118
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:05,782
team D? Team B, we've gone around

119
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:10,010
on a loop here, and perhaps with no great resolution,

120
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,578
with the lack of an incident commander. That's typical in this kind

121
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:17,638
of a structure. It teams to confusion,

122
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,880
longer response times, longer resolution times,

123
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,526
and it leaves the other concerned people

124
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:28,158
kind of floating out there in the

125
00:08:28,164 --> 00:08:31,982
fog somewhere. They don't know who to talk to. 1 minute they're talking

126
00:08:32,036 --> 00:08:35,246
to somebody on team b, and the next minute, oh no, we're not involved

127
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,278
in that anymore. And it's

128
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:42,370
not a great experience for the outside folks.

129
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,766
An alternative to avoid this problem with

130
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:51,574
passing the baton from team to team to team is the all

131
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:55,334
hands on deck approach. The page may go

132
00:08:55,372 --> 00:08:58,902
out to all four teams at once, plus an incident

133
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,874
commander. This can

134
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:06,474
have different variations, so maybe it goes to these

135
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,782
on call engineer from each of the teams.

136
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:13,854
Perhaps it goes to a single cross functional team that has all the

137
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:17,040
capabilities that are needed within that one team.

138
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,990
Or literally it could go to everyone. There are

139
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,122
organizations where an incidents will trigger 100

140
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:29,140
or 200 people to join the situation room, the channel,

141
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,020
whatever the communication framework is.

142
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,450
This can lead to teams that are seeking

143
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,246
to escape. So essentially you summon four teams into

144
00:09:40,348 --> 00:09:44,246
every incident. Their first thought is going

145
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:48,460
to be, okay, how do I get out of these and leave

146
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,210
some of the other teams holding the bag?

147
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,894
Not necessarily the greatest collegial

148
00:09:56,022 --> 00:10:01,130
experience and can lead to some unfortunate

149
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,846
dynamics, but at least we have an

150
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:09,274
incidents commander. And so the outside parties that are wondered

151
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:13,314
know who to talk to and then they

152
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:16,978
can work through that process in order to

153
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,140
understand what's happening with the event.

154
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,498
Can alternative approach is an escalation or a tiered model.

155
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:28,530
This is very common in organizations that have a knock,

156
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,230
a network operations center, or some variation thereof.

157
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,150
Calls, alerts come into the knock.

158
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,822
They triage those calls, either decide

159
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:43,930
which tier two team to escalate to,

160
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,414
or ideally try to solve some large percentage

161
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:51,514
of them without requiring the escalation. Tier two gets involved

162
00:10:51,562 --> 00:10:54,878
when necessary. They try to take out another

163
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:58,474
chunk of the calls and only bother the expert

164
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:01,230
team three on occasion.

165
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,100
This one has a question of where does the incidents commander come from.

166
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,746
Some organizations will have incident command be a

167
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:13,634
responsibility of the NOC and they have the expertise. They have

168
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:17,286
people trained in doing incident command and will follow through the

169
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,582
escalation process. But this isn't always the case.

170
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:24,594
And again, it's an open question that organizations

171
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:29,150
will solve in different ways. If there's not an incident commander,

172
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,366
the outside concerned people have the same challenge of knowing

173
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:37,340
who to talk to was in the one at a time model.

174
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,134
If these is an incidents commander, that mitigates the problem for

175
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:43,550
the other parties that are involved.

176
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,258
There's another model that has come into the tech industry

177
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:52,802
maybe about ten years ago, adapted from

178
00:11:52,856 --> 00:11:54,530
emergency response,

179
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,894
firefighting, FEMA emergency response

180
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:02,820
called ics or incident command system,

181
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,160
and the first adaptations of this into the tech world.

182
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,938
I'm calling strict ICs. These incident commander

183
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:16,306
is literally in command and if they don't

184
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:19,834
do their job, nobody else is going to do anything at all.

185
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:23,382
This can be thought of in the scenario of wildland

186
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:27,494
fire response, where the fire chief tells

187
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:31,530
each of the teams what they're going to be doing. They're very directive

188
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,406
and very tightly organized, I guess is the best way

189
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:39,214
to put it. Other concerned people are

190
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:42,910
kept informed because you've got a communications lead role.

191
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,086
And the problem is that this doesn't

192
00:12:47,118 --> 00:12:50,450
really fit well with an agile,

193
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,570
everybody takes responsibility,

194
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,374
engineering culture. And so there's an adaptation from

195
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:01,618
strict ics that has evolved in the tech industry,

196
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:06,022
which was come to be known as adaptive ics thanks

197
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,622
to the work of Laura McGuire. Essentially the technical

198
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:12,298
teams undertake their own work,

199
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:16,006
largely in a self directed manner. The incident commander

200
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:19,974
and the communications lead end up being a

201
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:24,074
wrapper or a protection for the technical teams

202
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:27,806
from the outside world. They provide the

203
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,486
communications in and out, and the

204
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:35,650
incident commander is responsible again for focusing on

205
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,714
how the event is being conducted, making sure the teams have

206
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:43,650
who and what they need, making sure that the teams are staying

207
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,618
functionally operational, that people aren't

208
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:50,680
getting too tired out and wiped out from the process.

209
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,634
My colleague Matt Davis has coined this term, the response

210
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:59,910
trio. The incident commander, the communications

211
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,700
lead, and then the problem solving team,

212
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,046
all working together in concert to accomplish

213
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,146
these goal of solving these problem as quickly and effectively

214
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,046
as possible. The incident commander's key role is to

215
00:14:14,068 --> 00:14:17,760
be focused on the coordination aspects of these problem.

216
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:22,230
How is the response being conducted, not the incident

217
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,826
itself. They're not diving into the metrics or the

218
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:29,650
graphs and the logs. That's the technical team, the problem

219
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,054
solvers. The incidents commander is responsible

220
00:14:33,102 --> 00:14:36,786
for upholding and maintaining the common ground throughout

221
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:39,590
the response team and throughout the response period.

222
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,930
Let's recap some of these pieces

223
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,120
quickly as I draw this to an end.

224
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,878
We have the OodA loop. Observe,

225
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,220
orient, decide and act,

226
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,874
which is the process that everybody is doing.

227
00:14:58,992 --> 00:15:02,814
Even the incident commander is observing how the

228
00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:07,006
individual responders are interacting with each other

229
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:10,526
and seeking to make sure that, let's say, when a

230
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:14,162
new person comes in, they are brought up to speed quickly in

231
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:17,314
understanding the common ground that has been established and

232
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:21,394
maintained amongst the previous responding teams. As they

233
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:25,250
come in to join without having to distract the technical responders.

234
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,106
Everybody is orienting, understanding the meaning

235
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:32,850
of what they're seeing and observing, making decisions,

236
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,070
acting, and these repeating the loop regularly.

237
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,094
This is all in service of the technical sides of diagnosis

238
00:15:41,222 --> 00:15:44,010
and therapy. Handling the incident,

239
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,980
understanding the incident, and then handling it, solving it

240
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,962
again, recruiting people as a key component,

241
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:55,210
coordinating who does what, and then communicating

242
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,438
outside of the team. This is the functional side

243
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:02,834
of incident response, and pretty

244
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:06,354
much everything that happens can fit into one of these

245
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:09,906
categories. It can be helpful to think about,

246
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:14,062
is what I'm doing therapeutic, or is it diagnostic,

247
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:17,606
or is it an attempt at therapy? And if

248
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:20,886
it works, then we'll conclude, because it worked. Oh, that must

249
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:24,710
have really been the problem. That's not an unusual scenario.

250
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,740
Organizational models, we've looked at one at a time,

251
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,706
all hands on deck, an escalation model, and in

252
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:37,500
strict and adaptive ics. I want to point out

253
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,000
that while adaptive ics is kind of the

254
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,654
latest approaches and the one

255
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:50,186
that is generally widely accepted

256
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:53,886
amongst companies and organizations,

257
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,730
no one size or structure is

258
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,698
correct all these time. There are scenarios and

259
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:05,206
organizations where one at a time is the best that

260
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:09,922
you can do. Perhaps you have teams that are geographically

261
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:13,062
distributed. One model of

262
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:15,960
pass the baton is a follow the sun.

263
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,042
Team a works for 8 hours, and then they hand it off to team

264
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:24,246
b, and then they hand it off to team c. These are not functional teams,

265
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:28,346
but they're time zone teams. And again,

266
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:32,270
handoffs. There's a lot of literature and analysis around

267
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,546
effective handoffs and ineffective handoffs that I don't

268
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:39,418
have time to go into. But this is one aspect

269
00:17:39,514 --> 00:17:43,220
of a pass the baton. You can pass it around the world.

270
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,738
All hands on deck can be the right scenario, depending on or the

271
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:52,690
right approach in particular scenarios.

272
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,686
And so it's important that you don't hear

273
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:01,206
any of this as being down on a particular

274
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:05,046
model. Understand these strengths, understand the weaknesses of the

275
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:08,646
model, and then adapt them to your scenario is

276
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,220
the best way to do it.

277
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,226
You recall at the beginning that I said I was going to jump into the

278
00:18:15,248 --> 00:18:19,430
middle of the story. There's much more to explore regarding

279
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,034
interteam dynamics as well as the organizational context

280
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:26,506
in which those dynamics happen, and I'd encourage anyone who's

281
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,266
interested in these topic to dive into the literature of resilience engineering,

282
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:33,246
adaptive capacity, and safety too.

283
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:36,926
I have some resources for further reading on

284
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:41,246
the next slide. As a starting point, I'd like you to

285
00:18:41,428 --> 00:18:44,998
consider the question, why is this thing making no

286
00:18:45,044 --> 00:18:48,470
ways? And is it actionable?

287
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,594
So here are some suggestions for further reading, and I'd invite

288
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:58,550
you to reach out to me either through the conference discord or

289
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,246
through email with any questions that you have. Thank you

290
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:05,926
very much for considering these varieties of

291
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:06,850
incident response.
