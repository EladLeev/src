00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,086
Good day everyone. Welcome to our session.

2
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:16,182
In this talk, we will discuss several practical strategies

3
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:19,894
for optimizing incident response workflows and leveraging

4
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:23,338
aipowered solutions for intelligent decision making.

5
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:27,734
We'll dive into how each of these strategies and solutions can ultimately

6
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:31,754
build resilience in incident management process. Before we

7
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:35,890
start, we'll quickly introduce ourselves. I am Sophie Soliven and

8
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,682
am the director of operations for Edamama. I have over nine

9
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:43,026
years of experience in e commerce, fintech and retail in the

10
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:46,450
Philippines. Over the years I have built my expertise on

11
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,134
process management, risk management and everything else in between.

12
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:53,654
I am Joshua Arvin Lat, the chief technology officer of

13
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:57,494
Nuworks Interactive Labs. I am an AWS Machine Learning

14
00:02:57,532 --> 00:03:00,982
hero and I'm also the author of three

15
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:03,580
books focusing on AI and security.

16
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,300
Here in the screen we can see three books I've written these past three years,

17
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,126
machine learning with Amazon Sagemaker cookbook, machine learning Engineering

18
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:16,330
on AWS, and building and automating

19
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,040
penetration testing labs in the cloud.

20
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,226
Without further ado, I'll hand you over back to Sophie

21
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:27,150
to discuss the relevant concepts to start this session.

22
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,722
So imagine running an e commerce web

23
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:34,802
application. The web application has been running smoothly without

24
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:38,738
issues for about a year now, until the customer started

25
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:43,186
complaining that they are unable to check out and complete the payment flow.

26
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:47,382
What if this issue is resolved only after five days?

27
00:03:47,516 --> 00:03:50,630
This would mean that five days worth of sales is affected.

28
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,198
Here we clearly have what we call an incident.

29
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:58,470
An incident is an unforeseen event that adversely affects

30
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,998
a system, service or operation,

31
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,878
necessitating a response to mitigate the impact here,

32
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:08,234
these primary objective of the team is to restore normal

33
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:12,634
operations as quickly as possible while minimizing

34
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:16,358
disruption and learning from the incident to prevent recurrence.

35
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:19,874
That said, it is unacceptable to wait

36
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:22,530
for five days CTo resolve such incident.

37
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,246
If we can resolve the issue within a few minutes, then better managing

38
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:31,510
incidents can be compared to navigating a labyrinth for several reasons.

39
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,982
Just like a labyrinth can have intricate and

40
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:39,010
convoluted pathways, incident management often involves

41
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,246
complex and multifaceted situations.

42
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:45,654
Incidents can be caused by a variety of factors,

43
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:49,370
involve multiple stakeholders, and require intricate problem

44
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,014
solving. Labyrinths are designed to disorient

45
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:56,480
and challenge individuals by obscuring the path forward.

46
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,214
Similarly, incidents often arise unexpectedly and

47
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:04,830
there may be a lack of clarity about the root causes and the best course

48
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,190
of action. Labyrinths contain dead ends

49
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,062
or paths that lead to nowhere, and incident management

50
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:15,826
can also involve encountering obstacles or dead ends where

51
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:19,522
the chosen approach does not lead to a resolution. In both

52
00:05:19,576 --> 00:05:23,090
cases, it requires backtracking and reassessment.

53
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,206
Just as individuals navigating a labyrinth may feel a sense of

54
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:29,590
urgency to reach the exit,

55
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:33,718
incident management often comes with time constraints.

56
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:38,566
Rapid response and resolution are essential to minimize the impact of incidents.

57
00:05:38,758 --> 00:05:42,458
Is there a way to significantly speed up the incident management process?

58
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:46,682
Yes, there is. We can utilize various automation strategies

59
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,042
and tools to efficiently detect and categorize

60
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:53,982
incidents, send alerts to relevant personnel, and even

61
00:05:54,116 --> 00:05:58,046
initiate predefined response procedures to mitigate

62
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:01,698
the impact of the incident. By reducing the

63
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:05,074
need for manual intervention, automation enables a

64
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:08,346
more rapid and consistent response to incidents,

65
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,030
which can lead to minimize downtime and improve operational resilience.

66
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,346
Nowadays, automation strategies may also be aipowered

67
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,406
as well. AI, with its

68
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:23,738
ability to learn from data and improve over time,

69
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:27,238
can significantly enhance the effectiveness and efficiency

70
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:30,970
of incident management automation. For instance,

71
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,610
AI can help in the rapid identification and categorization

72
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,002
of incidents, even predicting potential

73
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,462
issues before they occur based on historical data

74
00:06:42,516 --> 00:06:45,630
and real time monitoring. Moreover,

75
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,426
AI can automate these analysis of incidents to

76
00:06:49,448 --> 00:06:53,554
uncover underlying trends and provide insights which

77
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:57,442
can be instrumental in not only resolving incidents more quickly,

78
00:06:57,576 --> 00:07:01,510
but also in proactively improving system resilience against future

79
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,682
incidents. The fusion of AI and automation

80
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:09,746
heralds a new era of intelligent incident management,

81
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:12,870
enabling organizations to better anticipate,

82
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,090
respond, CTO, and learn from operational disruptions.

83
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,102
One of the practical applications of AI and automation

84
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:23,586
involves chatbots that can provide immediate

85
00:07:23,638 --> 00:07:27,706
responses to common incidents or queries, helping to alleviate

86
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,514
the workload on human operators. These AI tools

87
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:35,470
can interact with users to gather initial information about the incident,

88
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,586
guide them through basic troubleshooting steps, or escalate the

89
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:42,210
issue to the appropriate personnel if necessary.

90
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,460
Additionally, by analyzing past interactions and

91
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,642
continuously learning from new data, these chat bots

92
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:55,094
can become increasingly proficient at

93
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:59,126
handling a wider range of incidents, further enhancing the

94
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:01,820
efficiency of the incident management process.

95
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,678
Now that we have a better understanding of the relevant concepts

96
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:10,634
such as automation and AI, let's now talk

97
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:15,066
about pragmatic automation. Pragmatic automation emphasizes

98
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:18,654
a balanced approach, CTO automation, by identifying and

99
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:22,126
automating only those specific aspects of a process

100
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,910
that yield significant benefits, such as improve efficiency,

101
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,934
accuracy, or cost savings. It operates

102
00:08:29,982 --> 00:08:34,130
under the understanding that while automation can provide substantial advantages,

103
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,194
not every aspect of a process needs to be or should be

104
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:41,978
automated. By carefully selecting which task

105
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:45,606
to automate, organizations can ensure that they

106
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:49,314
are investing their resources wisely, achieving meaningful

107
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,626
improvements without overcomplicating their processes

108
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:56,134
or systems. Consider a scenario where

109
00:08:56,172 --> 00:08:59,674
a company utilizes a cloudbased infrastructure to host its

110
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:03,114
application and manage its data. The cloud system is

111
00:09:03,152 --> 00:09:06,942
set up to generate alerts for a variety of issues such

112
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,562
as unexpected traffic spikes,

113
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:12,910
unauthorized access attempts, or system failures.

114
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,614
Pragmatic automation comes into play by selectively automating

115
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:20,690
responses to certain types of alerts, for instance,

116
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,846
auto scaling resources during traffic surges or blocking

117
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:29,194
suspicious IP addresses after unauthorized access attempts,

118
00:09:29,342 --> 00:09:32,614
while leaving other types of alerts for manual review and

119
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:34,600
intervention by the IT team.

120
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,690
When automating incident management processes,

121
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,662
it's practical to leverage existing tools and technologies

122
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:45,770
rather than building systems from scratch.

123
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,422
Optimizing established platforms and software can significantly

124
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:54,858
accelerate the automation process, ensuring quicker implementation

125
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:58,766
and potentially better reliability due to

126
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:01,950
the matured nature of the existing tools. For instance,

127
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,882
integrating widely used incident management tools can streamline

128
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:09,790
the automation of notifications solutions

129
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,370
and even remediation workflows.

130
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,326
Adopting a pragmatic approach by utilizing existing tools

131
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:21,062
also offers advantage of community support along

132
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:25,298
with a wealth of documentation, which can be invaluable in troubleshooting

133
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:28,230
and optimizing the automation processes.

134
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,882
Moreover, it can also be cost

135
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:35,514
effective, as it often requires less development time

136
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:39,660
and resources compared to creating a new system from the ground up.

137
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,162
This way, organizations can focus on customizing

138
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:47,838
and configuring the automation to meet their specific needs,

139
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:51,210
while also ensuring a robust and well supported incident

140
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,922
management process. AI and automation

141
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:59,294
have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing incident management,

142
00:10:59,422 --> 00:11:03,140
simulation, and training as well. For example,

143
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,714
there are now aipowered tools designed to automation even

144
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:11,506
these penetration testing process. Leveraging modern AI

145
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:15,394
models to conduct this test, these tools

146
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,858
can simulate a variety of cybersecurity incidents in a controlled environment,

147
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:23,706
providing a realistic training ground for IT and

148
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:27,110
security teams. Through the simulated scenarios,

149
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,114
professionals can gain handson experience in responding to

150
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,670
and mitigating potential security threats,

151
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,254
thus improving their readiness for real

152
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:41,534
world incidents. Cool, right? Another application

153
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:45,114
and strategy involves AIP powered

154
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,766
root cause analysis. AIP powered root

155
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:53,054
cause analysis, or RCA, leverages artificial intelligence

156
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:56,926
and machine learning to identify the underlying causes

157
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,800
of problems or faults within a system.

158
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,826
Unlike traditional methods, which may rely

159
00:12:03,858 --> 00:12:07,458
heavily on human expertise and manual analysis,

160
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:11,090
aidriven RCA can sift through large

161
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,486
volumes of data quickly to discover patterns

162
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:18,186
and anomalies that might indicate the root causes of

163
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:22,074
issues. Through machine learning algorithms, it can learn

164
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:25,518
from historical data and, of course, improve over time,

165
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:30,110
making its analysis more accurate and insightful with each iteration.

166
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:34,074
Aipowered root cause analysis not only accelerates

167
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:37,234
the diagnostic process, but also provides a

168
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:40,638
deeper understanding of the system's behavior

169
00:12:40,814 --> 00:12:43,650
and the interactions among its components.

170
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,646
Of course, even with advanced capabilities of Aipowered

171
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:51,782
RCA, it's essential to have human experts review and

172
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:55,842
assess the final output. Human oversight is necessary

173
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:59,906
to interpret the results within the broader context, make informed

174
00:12:59,938 --> 00:13:03,974
decisions based on the findings, and implement corrective measures

175
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:07,610
that resolve the issues effectively and sustainably.

176
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,450
Now, let's talk about automated remediation.

177
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,582
Automated remediation is a proactive approach towards addressing system

178
00:13:15,636 --> 00:13:19,434
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. Strategies range

179
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:23,278
from basic notification and logging to full

180
00:13:23,364 --> 00:13:27,582
