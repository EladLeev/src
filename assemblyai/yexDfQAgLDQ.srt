00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,964
Hello everybody, I'm Rajulakshmi from Psi 24/7

2
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:22,820
happy to virtually meet you all in this event. Conf 42

3
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,544
SRE conference thank you for joining my session

4
00:02:26,592 --> 00:02:30,144
on the topic future of observability in an experience driven

5
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,556
economy. And the agenda that

6
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:36,988
we'll be discussing today are about digital experience,

7
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:41,016
the importance of it, observability versus monitoring.

8
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:44,696
What are the differences and what is DevOps SRE

9
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:48,504
and what does observability do with them? What are the pillars

10
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:52,048
of observabilitys, how you can achieve them? And how can

11
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:55,120
tools help in achieving observability?

12
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,528
So first, when we talk about experience,

13
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,610
particularly the digital experience,

14
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,844
the first thing that comes to my mind is this book by

15
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:09,664
Kathy Sierra. The book by name, badass making users

16
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:13,060
awesome I'm sure some of you would have read this book,

17
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,664
or I would strongly recommend you to read this book because

18
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:19,912
she gives a different perspective of how you have to keep

19
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,704
your users in the center of your business. And this

20
00:03:23,742 --> 00:03:27,496
opens our eyes in a different perspective. And there is

21
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:30,300
a question in this book, and this goes like this,

22
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,124
which would you rather have a user feel? And she goes on to give

23
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:37,884
four options, and you have to choose only one of the options.

24
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:41,304
Let's see what comes to your mind when you look at the options.

25
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,736
The options are, do you want your users to

26
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:48,848
have the feeling that the product is awesome? This is the product that

27
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:53,056
you are building, or you own the product. So do you want your users

28
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:56,964
to have the feeling the product is awesome or the company is

29
00:03:57,002 --> 00:04:01,350
awesome? The company that is building the product is awesome or

30
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,752
the brand is awesome? The brand that's owned by the company that is building

31
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:09,256
the product is awesome. Sounds tricky, right?

32
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:14,104
All of these answers look like they are correct, but she

33
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:18,344
says none of this. There is one more choice,

34
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:22,556
which is the right answer and which is I am awesome.

35
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:26,636
So you have to make your users feel that

36
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:30,110
they are awesome. But wait,

37
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,368
people don't actually talk like that. Nobody says, I am awesome

38
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:37,376
because of this product. They only go on to say,

39
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:41,120
I like this product or the app is amazing. That's a question that comes

40
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,384
to all of us. This is exactly the snippet

41
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:47,670
from the book. So she goes on to say,

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,524
when a customer or when a user, he or she

43
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:55,188
says, this product is amazing, you should see what it does.

44
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:58,392
They actually mean I am amazing.

45
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:01,912
You should see what I can do with it. So when you have

46
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:05,656
such users who have a feeling that they sre awesome because

47
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,144
they are using the product, they will do a lot

48
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:12,604
of things. When a user feels they are awesome. These sre some of the things

49
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:15,708
that they will do, they will go about talking for the product,

50
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:19,592
evangelizing, free marketing. They will remain loyal,

51
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,536
they will tolerate problems. Whatever be the problem in the product,

52
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:27,132
they will be able to tolerate it and they'll resist competition.

53
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:31,184
They wouldn't want to go to the competition, they would want to stick with

54
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:34,896
the product that they sre using. And they'll form community groups.

55
00:05:34,928 --> 00:05:38,244
And there are situations where even before the

56
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:41,540
customer, even before the product owner answers the questions,

57
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,776
there are diehard fans who would want to solve problems for other users

58
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,016
and they'll show off their results and lot more. So these are all

59
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,680
the outcomes when you have the user feel that they are awesome.

60
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,960
So such users are the secret for

61
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:59,900
sustained success. The successful users, all of us at business,

62
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,972
we want to be doing business in the long run.

63
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:07,112
Sustained success. The secret lies with successful users.

64
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:09,564
And if you want successful users,

65
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:12,848
user experience is important. And in

66
00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:16,000
this digital world, digital user experience is important.

67
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,560
User experience could be in any format. It could be in the way your

68
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,656
support technician picks up the calls and answers a query.

69
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:27,712
Or it could be the way how you are designing your UI,

70
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:31,152
keeping it very simple, having all the configurations,

71
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:34,688
easy to do, easily understandable.

72
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:38,024
Or you automate many things such that

73
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:40,904
the user may not do out of the box stuff.

74
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:44,728
It could be in any format. But experience plays a

75
00:06:44,734 --> 00:06:48,012
major role as a differentiating factor if you want to stay ahead

76
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:51,804
of your competition. And there is an

77
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:55,756
article, Forbes article, that talks about 100 things in

78
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:59,500
the digital world and user experience, 100 stats, and I've just taken

79
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,372
few from that. 89% of companies have adopted digital

80
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:06,528
first strategy. They have started moving to the digital world.

81
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:10,624
And 86% of companies believe that cloud technology is

82
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:14,048
critical for digital transformation. You want to take your product to

83
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:17,732
the digital world. You can't say that I would want to

84
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:21,300
take it to the digital, but I will still be using my legacy code,

85
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:25,160
legacy software that I have been doing. Technology? No, you have to

86
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,964
adopt to the relevant cloud technologies if you want to adopt

87
00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:33,080
digital. And 67% of consumers will pay

88
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,044
more for a great experience. So experience is important. They don't

89
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,644
mind paying for that extra for that.

90
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:43,560
87% of companies think digital will disrupt their industry.

91
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,148
So people have started feeling, and I should say this last

92
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:51,052
two and a half years, this pandemic has only accelerated

93
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:54,736
the digital adoption and people have started moving to

94
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:58,716
the digital world. 83% of enterprise workloads

95
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:02,576
are in the cloud. It's not that only the startups or SMBs are in

96
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:06,116
the cloud, even enterprises have realized the importance and they are

97
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:09,796
moving to the cloud. So all these facts and the references that I

98
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:13,812
quoted goes on to say that digital experience

99
00:08:13,946 --> 00:08:17,252
is important and we are

100
00:08:17,306 --> 00:08:20,484
living in this era of experience driven economy.

101
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:23,800
This is going to have an experience that you're going to give for your customers,

102
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,452
is definitely going to have an impact on your business

103
00:08:27,586 --> 00:08:30,430
and the economy of your business.

104
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,764
Let's now look into observability. What is

105
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:39,100
observability and how is it different from monitoring?

106
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,708
Is monitoring and observability, are they the same or are there any differences?

107
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:47,392
So I would want to put it in a simple way as

108
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:51,864
the observability. When you talk about observability versus monitoring,

109
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:55,936
the base of any system or any monitoring

110
00:08:55,968 --> 00:09:00,310
that you want to do is observabilitys. That is the underlying platform.

111
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,356
Because only if your systems are observable, whatever you

112
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:08,056
want to observe, be it your server or your application, whatever you want to

113
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:11,304
do, the system have to be observable. There must be

114
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,920
some ways, some APIs or some protocols using

115
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,476
which you can fetch the relevant data that you want to

116
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:22,716
monitor. So the underlying is observabilitys on

117
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:26,670
top of which monitoring lies only if your systems are

118
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,472
capable of being observed.

119
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:33,916
You can do monitoring on top of it and you can collect all the relevant

120
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,324
metrics. Depending on what you are monitoring, the metrics

121
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:41,040
will vary and you can collect the relevant metrics. So that monitoring is the

122
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,516
second layer and there's no point in just collecting all

123
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:48,704
these metrics and keeping it with yourself. You have to do analysis

124
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:52,084
on top of it with the data, the humongous amount of

125
00:09:52,122 --> 00:09:56,064
data that any system is collecting. There has to be analysis

126
00:09:56,112 --> 00:10:00,072
and there has to be segregation and make meaning out of the data

127
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:03,576
that you collect. There's no point in just collecting data if you're not going to

128
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:07,192
make sense out of it and give that benefit to customers.

129
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:11,176
So this is the stack that I would call observability is the underlying

130
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:15,176
platform. Then you can do monitoring and then you have to do analysis

131
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,364
on top of it. Don't just keep your data idle. If you're not going

132
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:21,420
to do anything with the data that you're collecting,

133
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,316
do not collect it. Why waste your resources?

134
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:27,644
So keep in mind, all the data that is being collected

135
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:31,504
has to be analyzed, maybe for various reasons only.

136
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:35,252
If you have such data and such analysis, you can apply

137
00:10:35,306 --> 00:10:38,608
the latest technologies of the AI capabilities.

138
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:42,912
I'll be talking about AI towards the end of the session too. But analysis

139
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,216
is important. Let's move on

140
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:49,764
to how I see DevOps and the definition

141
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:53,720
for DevOps SRe. And what is that to do with observability?

142
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,900
DevOps. So if you take DevOps, there are different definitions

143
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,368
of continuous feedback mechanism,

144
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:04,796
is what we all know of, but I see it in a

145
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,604
different analogy. So there

146
00:11:08,642 --> 00:11:11,424
used to be, no, I shouldn't say there used to be. There is still this

147
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,136
role called developers whose actual role is to

148
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:18,796
write code and then make sure that there are no errors

149
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:21,650
in the code, bundle it as a product,

150
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,212
build it, attend to all the code level errors, and they think with that

151
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,316
their role is over possibly ten years ago.

152
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:32,788
I've been in the industry for 22 years, I've been a developer myself.

153
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:36,036
So we used to do this. We think that that's the role of

154
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:39,720
developers, and with that we are done. And we pass this on to another person

155
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,000
who's the operator, who actually takes care of

156
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,584
deploying the build, attending to customer complaints, making sure

157
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,144
the application is up and running, keeping up with the slas,

158
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:54,076
fixing any problems that happens in the system. So all this used to be the

159
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:57,756
role of operator. So these two roles were actually, or these

160
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,880
two roles, these two persons, they were actually different

161
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,336
and there were a lot of blame games. This is

162
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:07,232
not my problem. This is not my problem. This used to happen,

163
00:12:07,366 --> 00:12:10,172
but with digital adoption,

164
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:13,924
with the latest technologies and the transformation that is

165
00:12:13,962 --> 00:12:18,352
happening, where we are moving to an era of deploying

166
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,924
multiple builds within the same day, we at

167
00:12:21,962 --> 00:12:26,404
site 24/7 we do deploy, develop, and deploy three

168
00:12:26,442 --> 00:12:29,860
to four builds a day from what it used to be three bills.

169
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,276
I mean, a build in three months. That's how systems or companies are evolving

170
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:38,232
in such a situation. These two roles cannot be separate

171
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:41,644
and they merged, and that's when DevOps was

172
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:45,884
born, where this is how I sre DevOps as

173
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:49,388
a person or a character, or however you want

174
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:53,216
to define, they have to have some amount of knowledge of what

175
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:57,036
is happening in development to what is happening in deployment.

176
00:12:57,148 --> 00:13:00,496
Only then they'll be able to quickly fix any problem

177
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:03,676
and then take it to the production environment.

178
00:13:03,788 --> 00:13:07,284
And as seen in this diagram, he or SRE is

179
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:11,284
not a superhero to do all this by themselves, they need to make use of

180
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:14,976
tools. There are a lot of tools, be it in house tools or third

181
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:18,852
party tools, open source tools, lot of tools available, which helps

182
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,804
DevOps people in their day to day activities

183
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:26,840
to make sure that they are able to solve problems easily.

184
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,916
And DevOps is moving from in

185
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:35,468
the cloud. When we talk about things are moving to the cloud, digital is

186
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:38,936
being adopted. DevOps is transforming to Devsec

187
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,770
Ops, where security at all these layers are important,

188
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,116
be it at the application layer or at the infrastructure,

189
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:50,576
at all the places, it has to be safe and secure and that

190
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:54,292
has to be taken care. That is added as an additional role for

191
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:58,292
DevOps. Now this is about DevOps. What is

192
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:01,828
SRE? Are they both different or are they both same?

193
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:05,704
There are a lot of, what is it again? Definitions for

194
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:09,496
these two. But the simple definition or the simple way

195
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:13,032
of putting things about SRE is if DevOps is about

196
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,904
principles of what to be done, SRE is about

197
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:21,176
how you do things. So if you take the differences of DevOps

198
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:25,004
and SRE, DevOps might go with connecting the development and Ops team

199
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:28,316
with a set of principles and the primary focus here on

200
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:31,632
the delivery. Whereas SRE are the

201
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:35,040
more ops oriented and they are more towards

202
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,716
the production environment, where they respond to incidents,

203
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:42,556
monitor all the events and make sure that they reduce

204
00:14:42,588 --> 00:14:46,284
the fault and takes care of automation. They are to do with the reliability

205
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:49,444
of the systems and particularly things when

206
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:52,884
it is in the cloud and where you have to take care of all your

207
00:14:52,922 --> 00:14:56,824
deployments. Sre plays a major role. And if I have to put

208
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,456
this in the development terminologies or in the

209
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:05,044
Java terminologies, if I have to say SRE implements DevOps.

210
00:15:05,092 --> 00:15:07,790
That's how I would want to call this as.

211
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,104
So with that SRE definition,

212
00:15:12,232 --> 00:15:16,184
if we have to say, if you take a cloud architecture, there are various

213
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,976
layers in any cloud architecture, and starting from

214
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:23,724
end user layer to application to platform to infrastructure

215
00:15:23,772 --> 00:15:27,296
layer. And it is important for the SRE to have

216
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:30,540
an end to end visibility across all these layers,

217
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,028
because the problem could be anywhere. If you

218
00:15:34,054 --> 00:15:37,668
see it in the cloud, if your application is going down,

219
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:41,220
it could be because of an ISP problem in the customer

220
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,516
end, or it could be because there

221
00:15:44,538 --> 00:15:48,116
is a problem in the way the application is written, there is an indefinite

222
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:52,404
loop that is happening in the code, or it could be in a database

223
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,896
connection being not closed, or there is a leakage of resources that

224
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:59,436
is being used in a file in a platform layer, or even it

225
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,716
could be in a problem in a port, in a switch at the

226
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:06,392
infrastructure layer. Any problem anywhere in the stack

227
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:10,232
is going to impact your application, it's going to impact your

228
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:13,984
business. So end to end visibility of all these

229
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:17,424
layers is important, and SRE has to know that for which

230
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,828
tools will be helpful. And that's about the observability.

231
00:16:20,924 --> 00:16:24,724
SRE has to have an overall view of what is happening in

232
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:28,176
all these layers. Now, when we talk about the pillars

233
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:31,120
of observability. All of us know the three pillars.

234
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,608
There are three pillars. In fact there is another fourth pillar that

235
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:38,536
is getting added. But the main three pillars of observabilitys that

236
00:16:38,558 --> 00:16:41,640
is being discussed are about metrics.

237
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,508
We'll see in details. All of these two metrics

238
00:16:45,524 --> 00:16:48,728
is the first pillar traces where you get end to

239
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:52,684
end visibility or you get the line of code that is having issue and

240
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:56,024
logs. So these three are considered as the three pillars

241
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:59,436
of observability. So let's get into the details of what

242
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,400
do you mean by metrics, traces and logs.

243
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,012
That's what we will cover in this section, achieving observability.

244
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:09,696
So when we talk about metrics, as I initially said

245
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:13,548
during the observability section itself, anything that

246
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,344
you want to monitor, the metrics that you are monitoring will vary

247
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:21,684
depending on the component that you sre monitoring. If you are monitoring your

248
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:25,232
server, the metrics will be what is the cpu utilization,

249
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:28,888
what's the memory utilization, what are all the processes that are running in the system.

250
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:32,676
So those will be the metrics. If you're monitoring your application, the metrics

251
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,770
will be what is the response time, how many times a particular

252
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,652
transaction is being called and how many times

253
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:44,120
people are hitting the system. So those will be the metrics. What is the database

254
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,596
calls. So those will be the metrics. And if

255
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:50,320
you're going to monitor your database,

256
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,332
the number of connections, are all the connections

257
00:17:54,396 --> 00:17:57,484
closed? What are the slow queries? The metrics will vary.

258
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:00,620
So depending on the component that is being monitored,

259
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,672
the metrics will vary. And irrespective of whatever be the component

260
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:08,772
that we are monitoring, we have to make sure the

261
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:11,860
basic things are being collected. So in metrics,

262
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,136
whatever be the component that you are monitoring, the primary or

263
00:18:16,238 --> 00:18:19,400
the important thing is, but the availability metric,

264
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,416
uptime is an important metric to collect, be it your application or

265
00:18:23,438 --> 00:18:27,112
your database component, or your infrastructure server

266
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:30,524
network, underlying components are all of them up and

267
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:35,308
running. The industry standards expect 99.99%

268
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:38,508
availability. It's almost like 100%,

269
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:42,048
but you can have small difference here and there. So the

270
00:18:42,134 --> 00:18:45,756
industry standards have moved from three nines to five nines.

271
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:48,976
That's the expectation. That's what the competition is giving.

272
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:52,436
It has to be all the time, most of the time up and running,

273
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:56,580
which means you have to monitor all the resources, the entire

274
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,504
stacks. Availability metrics have to be monitored.

275
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:02,976
And in the cloud, security metrics

276
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,824
have to be monitored. Security metrics again will vary. If you sre talking about an

277
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:10,824
application, the metrics will be about have I made

278
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:14,420
sure that how sre you defining your security XML?

279
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,280
Have I made sure that if there are going to be hundreds of requests

280
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,424
coming in at the same time, have I defined all the thresholds properly?

281
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:25,464
So those are some things that you have to monitor.

282
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:29,368
And at the network level, am I able

283
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:32,832
to monitor all the relevant details and

284
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:36,764
have I made sure that one user's data is not accessible

285
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:40,352
by the other user being in the cloud, people are

286
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:44,192
believing or people are trusting the vendors and giving

287
00:19:44,246 --> 00:19:48,624
their data into your system. So you have to make sure that the user segregation

288
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:52,036
is taken care properly when you are designing your application and when you

289
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,848
are designing your database itself. So there are various metrics which you

290
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:59,272
have to look into with respect to security aspects too.

291
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:02,564
That has to be taken care. Then performance

292
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:06,372
metrics. You have to take care of all your availability metrics,

293
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:09,996
but that's alone not sufficient. You sre having your resources up and

294
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:13,368
running, but if they are going to be performing very, very slow,

295
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:17,480
it's going to have an impact on your business. Industry expects,

296
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,764
industry standards expects just 2 seconds for any application

297
00:20:20,882 --> 00:20:24,656
to respond. And it plays an important role in defining your

298
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:28,396
SEO. What is it in defining your marketing standards

299
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,520
and making sure that you are able to come up in any of your

300
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,812
search engine optimization. So performance plays a key role of

301
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:39,456
how quickly you sre able to respond. And performance again has to cater

302
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,104
with all the layers, with your applications performance, your database

303
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:47,412
performance, your server performance, your network performance, your end users

304
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:50,980
performance, where you have to take care of your ISP,

305
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,884
your browser, your device type and the version.

306
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:58,188
All those plays an important role. So performance metrics have to

307
00:20:58,194 --> 00:21:02,268
be monitored and scalability metrics. There are

308
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:06,744
different areas, the different domains.

309
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:10,608
If you are a startup to SMBs, to enterprises, you have

310
00:21:10,614 --> 00:21:14,256
to take care of how quickly can you define and you

311
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:17,584
can define and do auto scaling. And when we talk about

312
00:21:17,622 --> 00:21:21,632
scalability, both the aspects of vertical scaling and

313
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:24,788
horizontal scaling has to be taken care. There could

314
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:27,860
be situations where depending on the load,

315
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,532
your system can only handle certain amount of load. You want to

316
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:36,292
add more instances and take care of horizontal scaling.

317
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:40,916
Or there could be situation where there are cpu

318
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:44,404
intensive calculations that are happening where you want to increase

319
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:48,072
the size and take care of vertical scaling. All these metrics have to be taken

320
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:51,836
care. Then cost metrics have to be taken care. When you are deploying in the

321
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:55,724
cloud, are you really utilizing the resources that you have

322
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:59,916
purchased? Lot of time. What happens is when

323
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:03,372
we purchase the system or when we use a cloud environment,

324
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:06,864
we use our credit card and we start using it

325
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:10,412
with that. There is another department, the finance department,

326
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:14,528
that takes care of paying the bills every month. Are we fully utilizing

327
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:18,564
the resources those have to be monitored there SRE

328
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:22,772
surveys that says that 30%

329
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:25,972
of the resources are not being utilized under

330
00:22:26,026 --> 00:22:29,544
utilization. So you need to measure all those metrics and

331
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:33,272
make sure that you use fully of whatever

332
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:36,616
you are preparing. So cost angle have to be monitored. These are the

333
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:40,396
different types of metrics that you have to take care of when

334
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:43,964
you are monitoring your entire infrastructure. Moving on to

335
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:47,516
traces what is that you have to do in traces? Traces is to

336
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:51,056
do with having an end to end visibility or

337
00:22:51,238 --> 00:22:54,192
pinpointing to the line of code that is having issues,

338
00:22:54,326 --> 00:22:58,284
particularly where the industry is moving from a monolith

339
00:22:58,332 --> 00:23:01,876
architecture to a microservice architecture and each of the

340
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:05,360
components is running in its own container,

341
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,352
where the container can be spawned,

342
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:12,448
deployed, destroyed of its own. So it's very changing.

343
00:23:12,544 --> 00:23:16,464
Even though the architecture looks very simple, monitoring this environment

344
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:19,924
is very changing. Each of them can have its own programming

345
00:23:19,972 --> 00:23:23,128
language too. Then how do you make SRE to find out where the problem

346
00:23:23,214 --> 00:23:26,328
is? So in such situations, tracing across

347
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:30,072
all these tires, be it your client or your web or your server

348
00:23:30,136 --> 00:23:33,596
or your data tire, where within your server layer you

349
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:36,876
can have set of missions for data securing, set of

350
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:40,496
missions for data collection and set of missions for data processing, you need

351
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:43,824
to know exactly where the time is being spent. There are

352
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:48,400
situations we have faced where a particular transaction takes

353
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,052
or does millions of method calls and you will get such

354
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:56,816
issues only in real time deployment. So you need to know it's

355
00:23:56,848 --> 00:24:00,230
very tough or it's very changing to find out the problem

356
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,688
in the real time deployed environment. So the

357
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:09,352
tools will help. And tracing across all these layers is also

358
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:13,160
important. Distributed tracing in a microservice architecture where

359
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,524
one problem will have a cascading effect on the entire architecture

360
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:21,544
of your application. So it's important for you to trace

361
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:25,704
them and then moving on to the third pillar, which is again, which is logs.

362
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:29,324
Logs. Why has logs become a pillar? Is all

363
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:33,056
of us. Whenever we have a problem, we go look at the logs to

364
00:24:33,078 --> 00:24:37,404
find out what are the issues in it. And when we have our deployment

365
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:41,136
in a distributed architecture, finding out exactly,

366
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:44,876
or taking remote control of each of those missions and going and looking

367
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:48,724
into where the problem is, is going to be challenging. Instead, if we are

368
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:52,016
able to collect all these logs from the distributed architecture,

369
00:24:52,128 --> 00:24:55,524
do some processing on top of those logs, and store it in such

370
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:59,416
a way where you can easily touch them and look at what the problem is,

371
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:03,300
that's going to be helpful for SRE. So consolidating

372
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,616
logs from across all the servers, doing all the real time,

373
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:10,264
prepping and storing it in an easily queryable format

374
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:14,104
is what is log management. In one simple term it is converting

375
00:25:14,152 --> 00:25:17,624
your unstructured data into structured data is log management

376
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:21,120
and out of the box there are support for all the common

377
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,860
applications that are available and the logs SRE also helpful

378
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,076
for your audit trials, be it your database logs,

379
00:25:28,108 --> 00:25:31,792
applications logs, network logs, there are different types of logs and

380
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:36,112
all these logs SRE required in a cloud environment.

381
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:39,876
These are required for your auditing and compliance too.

382
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:43,924
And these logs will actually help you to find out what changes have

383
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:47,284
gone in, who has done the change and where was the change done, when was

384
00:25:47,322 --> 00:25:51,032
this done? These are some important queries to be addressed to build

385
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:54,808
the trust because sometimes you might never know. The customer will come and say I

386
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:58,148
don't know when this change was done or who has done this change. Can you

387
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,484
help me in finding this out for which log management will be

388
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:05,848
helpful? So to put it in a nutshell, metrics traces logs

389
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:09,584
forms the three pillars of observability and definitely

390
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:13,452
the AI ops which people are using helps

391
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:17,056
SRE let's quickly look into just spend some two 3 minutes and look

392
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:19,840
into how AI ops helps SRE.

393
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,872
There are different ways how AI can help. It can help

394
00:26:23,926 --> 00:26:27,380
with evaluating past performance because you have all the data

395
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,236
in your system. Based on the historical data that is available with

396
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:34,756
you, the AI system will be able to predict and tell you

397
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:38,152
what to expect. Suppose you had a sale last

398
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:41,988
time, new year sale, you had a huge number of people landing

399
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:46,024
on your system and you wanted some ten extra servers. Based on

400
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:49,192
these data, when you are planning for another sale,

401
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:52,524
the system will be able to tell you what is that you

402
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:56,712
have to be prepared for and it will also enable help in enabling

403
00:26:56,776 --> 00:27:00,312
communication. Chatbots the chatbot integrations

404
00:27:00,376 --> 00:27:04,924
because all of us have our own communication channels, possibly you're using slack

405
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:08,300
for your communication, you're using Microsoft Teams for your communication,

406
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,836
and you don't want to go into another mission

407
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:15,636
to look at or another window to look at what the problem is. Whatever be

408
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:19,312
the monitoring solution, you can directly integrate into your chat

409
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:23,140
communication using chatbots. That will help. That's again possible using

410
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,920
AI Ops manage a flurry of alerts any monitoring tool

411
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,676
is to do with having a lot of alerts, segregating the alerts

412
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:34,116
based on the severity, assigning it to particular technician.

413
00:27:34,228 --> 00:27:37,324
All these can be the AI can help in doing it

414
00:27:37,362 --> 00:27:40,108
automatically so it can help.

415
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:43,740
One step ahead for you in resolving the issues

416
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,424
and then data correlation across tools.

417
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:49,880
Has any system uses multiple tools,

418
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,344
so the data results from all

419
00:27:53,382 --> 00:27:57,020
these tools can be correlated with the help of AI Ops.

420
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,796
Again, correlating test results we do a lot of testing. We do development

421
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:04,716
testing, changing testing, deployment testing, post production, pre production

422
00:28:04,748 --> 00:28:08,196
testing. All these test results have to be correlated where AI can

423
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:11,668
help and when we talk about AI, one of the important thing we have to

424
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:15,620
keep in mind is exhaustive. Training is important.

425
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,624
The AI system is only as powerful as how much

426
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:22,936
it has been trained. The accurate data points that

427
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:26,644
are fed into the system will help it to make correct prediction.

428
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,484
So that is something that we have to keep in mind when we talk about

429
00:28:29,522 --> 00:28:30,620
AI Ops.

430
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,636
Based on all these data, it can do an exhaustive self training so

431
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:40,568
that it prevents false alerts. So these are some ways in which AI can help.

432
00:28:40,754 --> 00:28:44,508
It can help in decision making coming up with forecastings

433
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:48,592
dynamic threshold settings the user need not set any threshold. Make it easy

434
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:52,848
for customer. Let the system decide based on the historical data.

435
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:56,416
I will adjust the thresholds and for each of the transaction

436
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,288
the threshold can be adjusted. Each of the server the thresholds can be adjusted.

437
00:29:00,384 --> 00:29:03,920
You can take a lot of collecting actions using automations

438
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,520
and scriptings which can be run automatically based on the predefined

439
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,564
threshold settings that SRE available. These will help in

440
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:17,916
resolving the problems and it will help the

441
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:21,324
SRE to make sure that they keep the system up

442
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:24,796
and running all the time. Conversational chatbots too.

443
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:28,248
The aiops there is a future is in aiops,

444
00:29:28,344 --> 00:29:32,540
finding the accurate anomalies, reducing the noise, more forecasting,

445
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,512
and we are moving towards from being proactive rather

446
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,984
than being reactive. So all along the industry has

447
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:43,644
been in a situation where when a problem occurs,

448
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:46,244
how do I go and fix it? What are the tools that can help me

449
00:29:46,282 --> 00:29:49,910
to fix the problems from that situation it's moving towards

450
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,368
let's be proactive, let's make sure that the problem does not happen in

451
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:58,376
the first place at all. So to achieve that, AI will

452
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,592
be helpful. So in a nutshell, if I have to say,

453
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:05,364
metrics, traces, logs combined with AI

454
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:08,628
Ops will be able to help sres in their day to

455
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:12,172
day activities and make it smooth and easy and pass

456
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:15,596
on that benefit to customers. These are possible with the

457
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:18,872
help of monitoring tools, collecting all your metrics,

458
00:30:18,936 --> 00:30:22,272
your traces, your logs, all in one

459
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:25,456
console and apply AI on top of it.

460
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,992
There are many such tools available in the market. One such

461
00:30:29,046 --> 00:30:32,636
is site 24/7 which is an aipowered full stack monitoring

462
00:30:32,668 --> 00:30:36,020
platform that lets you take care of all your monitoring needs.

463
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,636
The stack that I talked about from one single console. So we

464
00:30:39,658 --> 00:30:43,552
do have from website monitoring to server to cloud network,

465
00:30:43,696 --> 00:30:47,124
application performance, real time real user monitoring,

466
00:30:47,172 --> 00:30:50,536
application log management, cloud spend and status iq on

467
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,684
top of it. We do have alerting,

468
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:57,396
reporting and apply AI on top of this and PSi

469
00:30:57,428 --> 00:31:01,268
twenty four seven is hosted on Zoho's data center. Zoho has been

470
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:04,492
in business for 25 years. PSi twenty four seven is a mature product

471
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:07,928
in the market for close to 16 years now and we are hosted

472
00:31:07,944 --> 00:31:11,896
on Zoho's data center. Zoho has its data centers in five different

473
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:15,696
regions, ten different data centers in each of the region. We have a primary and

474
00:31:15,718 --> 00:31:19,536
a secondary data center. The customers can choose the data center

475
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:23,244
so that the data resides within the geographical boundary

476
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,624
of that particular region. We have it in one in us, one in Europe,

477
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:30,644
one in India, one in China, one in Australia. We are coming up with more

478
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,780
data centers depending on customers'requirements, too.

479
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,444
Being a cloud provider, we do take privacy, security and compliance

480
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:41,860
very seriously and get all the required or relevant certifications

481
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,160
that are required for us to be a cloud provider.

482
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,388
So the key takeaways from this session, the last almost

483
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:53,084
30 minutes that I've been talking SRE about experience is

484
00:31:53,122 --> 00:31:55,820
important, and when it is in the digital world,

485
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,496
digital experience is important. And when we talk about observability,

486
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:02,576
the main three pillars and how you can achieve the same,

487
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:06,604
and AI can help sres in achieving observability.

488
00:32:06,732 --> 00:32:10,450
PsI twenty four seven is an aipowered full stack monitoring platform.

489
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,944
So I would like to close with this quote. This is one of my favorite

490
00:32:14,992 --> 00:32:17,940
quote, and the quote goes like this.

491
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,332
We shape our tools and they in turn shape us is a

492
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:24,932
famous quote by Marshall McLean. And what this means is

493
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:28,928
the tools that you have in your hand has a great impact

494
00:32:29,024 --> 00:32:32,056
on the day to day activities that you do. When you have

495
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:36,104
a hammer in your hand, everything looks like a name that's a screw over

496
00:32:36,142 --> 00:32:39,676
there, but you only have a hammer in your hand and you

497
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:43,244
will end up only hitting it. So it's important for you to

498
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:46,732
choose the right set of tools depending on what your business

499
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:50,764
needs are what your customer requirements are, so that you can

500
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,036
take your business to the next level and be successful in whatever

501
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:58,750
role that you are playing. Thank you for your time.

502
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,044
Have a nice time. In the event, if you have any
