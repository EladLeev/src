00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,566
Everyone, welcome to my session. First I want to

2
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:26,866
thank comfort. Amazing this conference. Now let's

3
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:30,070
talk about the carbon emission of your cloud infrastructure.

4
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,922
I'm Olivier Biale. I'm usually software engineer at elastic

5
00:00:33,986 --> 00:00:37,334
in the reducing team, but I'm taking a break to work on

6
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:40,966
Carbonifer. Carbonifer is a platform for managing,

7
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:44,620
measuring and reducing the Carbonifer emissions of your cloud.

8
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,306
Here is a sentence I hear quite often. I have all my infrastructure in

9
00:00:49,328 --> 00:00:52,670
the cloud, so I do not emit co2. Yes, we all know that

10
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,650
whatever you put in the cloud disappear. It's just magic. It doesn't have physical

11
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,254
existence. But still we know that it's running on

12
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:04,014
servers and data centers and those are powered by electricity.

13
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:07,540
But electricity is clean, right? No, not really.

14
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,154
So let's talk about electricity. First let's look at some

15
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:14,670
numbers. We considered that data centers are responsible

16
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,722
of 20% to 25% of the electricity used by the digital

17
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:22,902
sector, which is one 3% of the total electricity used

18
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:26,434
worldwide. And if we look at some projection,

19
00:01:26,482 --> 00:01:30,106
we considered that by 2030 the

20
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:33,962
digital sector is going to be responsible of 20% of the

21
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:37,322
worldwide electricity demand and amongst that

22
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:40,278
the data centers are going to be responsible.

23
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:44,138
Third, if we talk in term of greenhouse

24
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:47,886
gas emissions, we consider that the cloud is emitting more

25
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,774
than 300 megatons of co2 yearly, which is around the

26
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,342
same carbon footprint as countries like France

27
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:59,726
or UK. We have recently overthrown

28
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:03,554
the civil aviation. Basically the cloud is emitting more co2

29
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:07,062
than flights and these numbers can

30
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:10,790
be around 8% by 2038%.

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,386
That's huge and that's concerning as human being, but it's

32
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:17,818
also concerning as company. Why? Because there is

33
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:20,460
some regulation and lows that care coming.

34
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,554
Looking at the carbon footprint of a company is

35
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:27,670
also a great way for attracting SG funds.

36
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,034
Those funds are investing money in companies that are

37
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:34,494
showing some sustainability and obviously as

38
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:37,902
a company you want to attract them. It's also a great tool for

39
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:42,142
recruitment and staff retention. You care more keen to join a company if

40
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:45,714
it's showing some ethics and

41
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:49,486
sustainability. And there are some studies that are showing that it's

42
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:52,450
also great for customer retention for the same reason.

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,650
And that could also lead to some cost reductions.

44
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,462
So in order to know what the company is responsible

45
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:04,614
of very three scopes. The first scope is

46
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:08,234
your direct emission. So basically if you are burning fuel or if

47
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:12,666
you have diesel generator for

48
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:16,294
example, in scope two is your indirect emission

49
00:03:16,342 --> 00:03:20,258
related to purchase of energy. So basically that's your electricity

50
00:03:20,294 --> 00:03:24,922
bill. Scop. Three is basically everything else. Other indirect emission,

51
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,174
value chain emission. So it's basically your

52
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:31,934
business travel purchase of servers, and even the

53
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:36,066
purchase of cloud services or your subscription to

54
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:39,906
a cloud provider. So basically, if you

55
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:43,042
are running your infrastructure on a private cloud, that means

56
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:46,566
the electricity used by this private cloud is going to be accounted in

57
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:50,454
your scope two, but the purchase of those

58
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:54,806
servers is going to be accounted in the scope three. If you are running only

59
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:58,186
on public cloud, that means everything is going to be

60
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,914
accounted as the scope three. So what should

61
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,940
we put in the scope three? For example,

62
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,886
Mozilla had a very wide definition of the scope

63
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:12,666
three in their sustainability report in 2019.

64
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:16,558
They counted the use of their product

65
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:20,654
and they discovered that 98% of their

66
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:24,434
carbon footprint is coming from the usage of their

67
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,198
product. Basically people using firefox.

68
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:30,578
And there is even some people that are thinking

69
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:34,162
of counting as the scope three. Even things

70
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:37,826
like Spotify, for example. If you

71
00:04:37,848 --> 00:04:41,698
need to have music streaming while you are working, while you are coding,

72
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:45,318
should we account that as the scope three of your company?

73
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:49,306
Because you need it. So you have emitted co2 for your work at

74
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:52,634
your company. So where should we stop? So basically, companies are

75
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:56,300
responsible of defining the parameter of their scope three.

76
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,694
In term of regulations, there are some directive and

77
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:05,354
laws coming in the next years. For example, in Europe,

78
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:09,258
you have the CSRD. CSRD stands for corporate sustainability

79
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:13,502
reporting directive. It's going to be enforced in 2024

80
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:17,426
for large companies and in two years for listed SMEs, it's going

81
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:21,550
to be for scope one and two and even scope three. The SFDR

82
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,206
is for financial companies, so they will need to

83
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:29,186
account as their scope three, the carbon

84
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:32,962
footprint of the company. They are financing. They are financing.

85
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:36,962
And in us you have the SEC climate

86
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:40,682
disclosure rule which is encompassing scope one and two,

87
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:44,134
and even scope three as optional. And it's going to be enforced

88
00:05:44,182 --> 00:05:48,058
pretty soon. So here are some terms

89
00:05:48,144 --> 00:05:51,966
you probably have heard. If we are talking about co2

90
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:55,690
offsetting, that mean we are doing some compensation

91
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,162
or removal. Removal is basically direct air capture,

92
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:02,326
removing co2 from the atmosphere.

93
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:06,242
Compensation is giving money to some project which

94
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:09,842
is helping offsetting co2,

95
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:13,662
basically planting trees. If we are talking about elimination,

96
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:18,034
that obviously mean we are not emitting co2. We are eliminating

97
00:06:18,082 --> 00:06:21,862
the source of co2. So if a company is talking

98
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:25,538
about being carbon neutral, that means they are not necessarily

99
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:29,894
looking at their emissions but just focusing on offsetting.

100
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:33,402
So they are emitting the same and they are

101
00:06:33,456 --> 00:06:37,306
just compensating or neutralize all

102
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:40,330
their emission by again planting trees.

103
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,446
If we are talking about net being net zero, that means

104
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:47,850
we are focusing on elimination. We are reducing

105
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,326
the co2 that we are emitting and we are

106
00:06:51,348 --> 00:06:54,562
offsetting the rest. If a company is talking

107
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:59,202
about 100% being renewable, that means they

108
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:03,438
are using only renewable electricity.

109
00:07:03,614 --> 00:07:07,054
But is it powered by or matched by powered by. That means

110
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:10,562
you are sure that the electricity coming in the data centers

111
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:14,422
are coming from renewable energy source if it's match

112
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:18,134
by that means. For example, if they are producing twice their

113
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:21,514
need with solar panel, but during

114
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:24,794
the night they still need to buy electricity on the market. So in that case

115
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:27,100
it's match buy, it's a little bit less interesting.

116
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,146
So now how we can measure your cloud infrastructure

117
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:37,230
and the carbon footprint of your cloud infrastructure. So how it's working.

118
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,422
Electricity is produced different ways. For example, coal or

119
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:44,740
gas plants, nuclear plants for example.

120
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,470
Side note, in this presentation,

121
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,166
nuclear is considered as clean energy because it doesn't emit

122
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:57,318
any co2. It could be also produced by renewable energy,

123
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:00,834
solar panel, windmills and hydroelectricity.

124
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:04,982
So all of this

125
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:08,570
generator of electricity is mixed in what we call an energy

126
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,602
mix. And this electricity is translating over

127
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:15,866
your regional grids. And when it entered the data center, a little

128
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:19,926
bit of this electricity is taken for powering

129
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,842
the administrative building, the air conditioning, the heating,

130
00:08:22,906 --> 00:08:26,638
et cetera, et cetera. But the large majority of the electricity is for

131
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:30,974
the servers. So if you have a cloud infrastructure on

132
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:34,638
a public cloud provider, that mean you will have VMS,

133
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:38,354
containers, applications running on those

134
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,730
servers and you can take a ratio of the

135
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,558
electricity powering this data center

136
00:08:45,644 --> 00:08:49,240
for your own component for your needs.

137
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,762
So in order to calculate that, the Green software foundation

138
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:57,378
came up with this Sci formula. SCi stands for

139
00:08:57,484 --> 00:09:01,034
software carbon intensity. So the idea with

140
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:05,274
that is to calculate how many gram of co, 2 /hour

141
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:08,330
your software is going to emit.

142
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,030
So let's look at the end of the formula.

143
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,706
What is the m here? It's called embodied emissions.

144
00:09:15,738 --> 00:09:19,390
So, embodied emissions is emission generating during

145
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,214
the manufacture, the delivery and the disposal of

146
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:26,734
your hardware. So for example, if you bought a server and

147
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:32,818
this server required 4000

148
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:36,326
be manufactured, that means virtually every year you

149
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:39,942
will emit 1000 kilogram of co2.

150
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,282
So you can do the math for knowing the ratio

151
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:47,030
per month, per hour per process, et cetera, et cetera.

152
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,506
The usage emissions are the emissions during the

153
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:55,260
use of your software. So for example,

154
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,298
if you are running AWS, m four large

155
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:03,726
machine with two cpu and 8gb of ram during

156
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:07,614
50%, with 50% use by your

157
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:11,214
process, there is some ways to calculate that it's going to

158
00:10:11,252 --> 00:10:14,654
use ten watts during an hour. So there's different ways

159
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:18,638
to calculate that. The easiest way is to use some probes,

160
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:22,194
but if you are running on the public cloud, you don't have access to the

161
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:25,966
hardware. So in that case there is some different ways to calculate that. So let's

162
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:29,282
assume it's ten watt during an hour. We multiply

163
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:33,122
that by the power usage effectiveness. The power usage effectiveness,

164
00:10:33,186 --> 00:10:36,822
the pue is how many kilowatt hour I

165
00:10:36,876 --> 00:10:41,420
need to inject in the data center in order to have 1.

166
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,338
So in AWS Ireland, we consider the PuE is one

167
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:48,906
two, which means we need one two kilowatt hour in order to

168
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:52,430
have 1 usable by the servers.

169
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,470
We multiply that by the carbon intensity of the grid.

170
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,118
For example, in Ireland we consider that the kilowatt hour generated

171
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:07,362
300 grams of co2 during

172
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:11,954
an hour. So that means that the energy mix the different ways

173
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:15,954
to generate electricity. In Ireland, the average during

174
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:19,670
a year is going to emit 300 grams of co 2.

175
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,062
So if you multiply all of that, we have the greenhouse house

176
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:27,302
emission in grams of co2 equivalent per

177
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:31,034
hour. So we are talking in gram of co2 equivalent because not

178
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:35,302
only co2 are emitted when we care generating electricity,

179
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:39,542
that could also be methane ch four. The methane

180
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:44,160
is 84 times more potent as greenhouse gas as

181
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,118
the co2. So in order to ease calculation, we care talking

182
00:11:49,204 --> 00:11:51,710
of gram of co2 equivalent.

183
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,798
So if we circle back to the sci formula,

184
00:11:56,894 --> 00:12:02,674
if we multiply e by I, which is the

185
00:12:02,712 --> 00:12:07,086
emissions of the use, we have three eight gram of co 2,

186
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:11,186
then we take the ratio of the embodied emission, basically the manufacturer

187
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:14,486
of this hardware. And in this calculation is when the

188
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:18,418
two gram of co 2

189
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:23,274
is now five gram of co 2 /hour so

190
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:27,190
where should we find this data? All those average

191
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,418
carbon intensity of regional grid care, really well known.

192
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:34,942
It's pretty easy to find. And you even have this

193
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:37,680
application name electricitymaps.com.

194
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,934
With this application you can browse a map where you can

195
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:46,786
click on some countries and have live carbon intensity of

196
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:50,434
the regional grids. In this example, in March 22 in

197
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,414
France it was emitting 157 grams

198
00:12:54,462 --> 00:12:57,574
of co 2, while in US

199
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:01,430
in New York region, it was emitting 100

200
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,910
grams of co2 more than France.

201
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,014
PUE is also pretty easily

202
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:12,570
available data. So for example, we have

203
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,650
all major cloud provider pv per data centers

204
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,262
there are data that are less available. For example,

205
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:24,510
the CPU memory and the storage,

206
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,310
the energy consumed by this hardware. For example,

207
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,862
if you are running on the public cloud, it's really difficult for you to have

208
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:36,702
access on the name of the CPU,

209
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,966
the brand of the GPU, the type of memory, et cetera,

210
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:43,330
et cetera. And you need to have that in order to calculate what

211
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,320
the power needed by those, and you need to have their

212
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,014
power profile, et cetera, et cetera. So in order

213
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:54,338
to ease that, we are using estimation and coefficient.

214
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:58,202
So with estimation it's sometimes sufficient to have

215
00:13:58,256 --> 00:14:01,690
rough number and to have some relative

216
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:07,066
calculations. But you need to be careful. For example,

217
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:11,690
if you are using gravitron instance on AWS with ARM CPU,

218
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,030
ARM CPU are really efficient in term of energy. It can be lower

219
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,626
than 1, while legacy

220
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:23,694
cpus could climb up to eight. So you need to be careful

221
00:14:23,742 --> 00:14:27,426
with those estimations. The embodied emission of the

222
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:30,942
hardware, again, the emissions generated

223
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:35,138
during the manufacture of this hardware, to know that, you need to know what

224
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:38,614
is the brand of hardware, where it has been produced and

225
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:41,974
when. And this data is pretty impossible to get if

226
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:46,018
you look at your AWS or GCP console.

227
00:14:46,194 --> 00:14:49,754
But fortunately we have some data sets around and some

228
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:54,106
benchmarks and the energy

229
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:57,674
mix is pretty difficult to predict. Obviously,

230
00:14:57,872 --> 00:15:01,370
to know what was the electricity mix in the past

231
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,814
and to have the carbon intensity of

232
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:08,206
some regions in the past is pretty easy to have. But in

233
00:15:08,228 --> 00:15:12,174
the future, in one, two, three weeks, one month, it's pretty impossible to

234
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:15,442
guess. In order to ease that,

235
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:19,422
fortunately, we have some tools. So major cloud providers

236
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:23,010
like AWS, JCP or Microsoft Azure have

237
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,770
released a carbon footprint tool, dashboard or calculator.

238
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,694
With that, with one click, you can have the carbon footprint of your

239
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:34,230
infrastructure per month and per account.

240
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,590
If you want to dive in a little bit more, you have tools like

241
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,210
cloud carbon footprint. It's an open source tool and basically

242
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,462
reads the bill of your cloud provider and get how many instances,

243
00:15:45,526 --> 00:15:50,130
what type of instances, during for how long, what kind of serverless

244
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,758
services you use, like lambda or

245
00:15:53,844 --> 00:15:57,840
anything else. And it gives you those

246
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,634
co2 emissions per day. And you can even do some nice

247
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:07,234
comparison, for example, knowing how

248
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:11,938
many flights from New York to London. It is similar.

249
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,370
And yeah, you have a lot of nice things in this dashboard.

250
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,746
If you want to be more accurate, you can use tools like Scaffondra.

251
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:24,022
So basically Scaffonder is monitoring cpu power,

252
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:27,846
so it's using some probes to get what the actual

253
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:31,626
electricity is used by your cpu. So obviously you will not

254
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:34,874
be able to use that on the cloud. But if you have access to your

255
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:38,950
physical machines, that's pretty interesting. It's not directly

256
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,654
telling you the Carbonifer emissions, but you have

257
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:46,270
the most complicated part, which is knowing the

258
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,950
electricity used by your software.

259
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,822
You have some interesting APIs like climatic. Climatic is a commercial API

260
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:59,854
not only for the cloud also for different sectors like freight or agriculture

261
00:16:59,902 --> 00:17:03,934
or anything, you name it. And among that they have cloud computing.

262
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,702
So basically you can query this API asking them hey,

263
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:11,110
I have an instance running on AWS for

264
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,614
this time and it's going to give you what is the

265
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:17,974
Carbonifer emissions of that. You can

266
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:21,542
also use tools made by Boa Vista.

267
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:25,318
So those are free open source tool and you have the Boa

268
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:28,906
vista API. Same thing you can query. I have a

269
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:32,670
machine running on AWS M four large during 1 hour

270
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,254
and it kind of give you what is the co2 emitted during

271
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:40,138
the use of this instance

272
00:17:40,234 --> 00:17:43,966
and it will give you the manufacturing emission, the embodied

273
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:46,210
emission for the entire lifespan.

274
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,250
And finally my little tool

275
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,458
named Carbonifer. So basically Carbonifer is able to

276
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:59,922
read terraform projects. So if you don't know terraform, terraform is an infrastructure

277
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:03,446
as code tool. So as a code you will describe what is

278
00:18:03,468 --> 00:18:07,502
the infrastructure we want to have deployed, for example on JCP.

279
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,014
So in this example you have an e two standard, two instance.

280
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:14,858
You want to deploy it in Europe west nine and

281
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:19,894
if you run terraform plan and terraform

282
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:23,726
apply, sorry, it will deploy it on GCP in

283
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:26,830
the region you pick and that's what terraform is.

284
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,034
So Carbonifer is pretty similar, but instead of deploying

285
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:34,526
it will read your terraform project and try to estimate

286
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:35,970
the carbon emissions.

287
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,330
Basically it's reading your terraform

288
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,094
infrastructure as code files and

289
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:51,414
try to make some estimations. Obviously those estimations will

290
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:55,010
not be accurate, it's just rough estimation. But it's

291
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,610
already a good way to make some comparison and take some decisions

292
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,186
there. Care some tools in this awesome list powered by the

293
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,802
Green Software foundation strongly encourage you to check those

294
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:12,030
out. So now we know how to measure your cloud

295
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,126
infrastructure, how we can reduce it. Obviously if you are

296
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:20,442
running a poorly designed, not optimized code on your infrastructure,

297
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:24,234
the only way you will get the performance

298
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:27,342
you want is by increasing the size of the machine.

299
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:30,866
So obviously you need to optimize your code and use some

300
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:34,466
eco design. Good practice for your software once you have

301
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:37,718
done that, very good practice is to choose

302
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:41,458
the right instance type and the right generation

303
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:45,222
of cpu. For example, you can use

304
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:49,110
gravitron instance on AWS and choose exactly the size

305
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,360
you want. You not necessarily need to overcome it.

306
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,826
And obviously a nice way to lower

307
00:19:56,928 --> 00:20:00,334
your carbon emission is to move to hyperscaler. So all

308
00:20:00,372 --> 00:20:04,382
major hyperscalers, public cloud like

309
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,854
AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure are

310
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:12,240
claiming to be net zero or even carbon negative by 2030.

311
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,246
They are making a lot of improvement on their pue,

312
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:20,846
on the lifespan of their hardware and buying

313
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:22,500
more and more renewable energy.

314
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,590
One thing which could be also interesting is looking at

315
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,920
alternative cloud providers. For example,

316
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,682
Denver in France is deploying

317
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,986
some floating data centers. So basically they're going to

318
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:43,242
be naturally cooled down by the stream. So those are

319
00:20:43,296 --> 00:20:46,906
really interesting to check. So basically if you have all

320
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:50,102
your servers on premises, you tend to have numerous

321
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,402
underused servers just in case you will have a search

322
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:57,258
of traffic. If you are in the cloud, you can adjust it to the bare

323
00:20:57,274 --> 00:21:01,280
minimum and have fewer highly used server which leads to

324
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,574
using less resources and then emitting

325
00:21:06,622 --> 00:21:10,834
less co2. So basically you

326
00:21:10,872 --> 00:21:14,354
would like to use some finops good

327
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:18,594
practices in order to be greenups basically. So FinOps

328
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:22,850
is a way for better controlling

329
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,226
the cost of your infrastructure. For example, if you are bringing

330
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:29,734
some automation to shut down instances

331
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:33,642
during the night or adjusting the number of instance to your

332
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:37,194
traffic, which is called auto scaling group, in that

333
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:40,666
case you will pay only what you need and not more.

334
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:44,234
And in that case you're using less resource and again you are emitting

335
00:21:44,282 --> 00:21:48,010
less co2. Be careful with the reserved instance.

336
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,678
With the reserve instance you're going to save a lot of money, but it's going

337
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:55,054
to be still the same amount of instance.

338
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:59,218
So in that case you will still emit a

339
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:00,420
lot of co2.

340
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,960
Obviously you need to pick the region which is having

341
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,862
the best carbon intensity. So in this

342
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:13,910
example, it's on Google

343
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,314
platform website. You have the different regions

344
00:22:17,362 --> 00:22:20,634
in Europe, and as you can see, that could be as

345
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,866
low as Paris with 70 grams of

346
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:27,898
co 2, up to more than

347
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:31,094
700 in Europe Central two.

348
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:34,190
So you need to pick the region very carefully.

349
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,422
And then if you want to be more fancy, you can move to

350
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:42,686
carbon aware. So Carbonifer aware is the ability of

351
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:46,014
a software or an infrastructure to know its own

352
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:50,494
emissions and to adjust itself according

353
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:54,146
to its own emissions. So the first things you can

354
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:57,602
do is temporary shifting. So basically temperate shifting

355
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:01,094
is scheduling asynchronous tasks when

356
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:04,514
the electricity is going to be less carbon

357
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:08,618
intensive. For example, video processing, AI training,

358
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:12,854
machine learning, et cetera. So if you want to train your AI

359
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:16,874
model, you don't necessarily need to

360
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:20,654
do it right now. You can wait for the electricity to be

361
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:24,590
less carbon intensive. That's exactly

362
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:28,142
what they are doing at Google for their

363
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:31,422
own need. So basically they care, waiting for the right

364
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:34,846
time frame to launch some synchronous tasks.

365
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:38,610
And doing that, they lowered a lot their carbon footprint.

366
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,078
Another thing you can do is demand shaping. So basically demand

367
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:48,322
shaping is doing more when electricity is emitting

368
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:51,926
less, for example, lowering the quality of the video when the

369
00:23:51,948 --> 00:23:56,050
electricity is very carbon intensive and go back to high definition

370
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,290
when the electricity is less carbon intensive.

371
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,546
Another good example is a CI server, adding more

372
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:07,450
or less worker to the CI server depending on the

373
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,526
carbonifer intensity of electricity. So basically, if it's

374
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:14,926
a peak of co2, during a peak of co2,

375
00:24:15,108 --> 00:24:18,750
your developer are going to wait a little bit more for having their

376
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,254
pr built and it's going to go back to normal when

377
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:25,330
the electricity is going to be greener.

378
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,050
Another good way is special shifting. So basically special

379
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,414
shifting is moving your infrastructure alongside with the carbon

380
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:37,782
emissions of local grid. Or if you have

381
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:41,494
two different data centers, picking the one with

382
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:44,806
the greenest energy mix. So for example,

383
00:24:44,908 --> 00:24:48,798
in odd carbon 23 conference raised

384
00:24:48,914 --> 00:24:53,450
some people that are shown, sorry that they are doing that with

385
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,290
two different data centers in two different regions.

386
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,106
So they have a load balancer directing the request from the

387
00:25:02,128 --> 00:25:05,578
user to the data center, which is the closest to the user,

388
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,370
and then they change it to take into account also the carbonifer intensity

389
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,246
of those region where those data centers are.

390
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:16,734
And by doing so, they managed to reduce their carbon footprint

391
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:20,434
by 21%, which is already great without

392
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:24,254
any compromise on the latency and with an acceptable

393
00:25:24,302 --> 00:25:28,326
latency, which means that the user will barely notice it, they managed to

394
00:25:28,348 --> 00:25:31,814
reduce their carbon footprint by 51%.

395
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:33,480
So this is super interesting.

396
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,234
So as a conclusion, if you want to be the

397
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:41,820
less carbon intensive and to have

398
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,678
a greener cloud infrastructure,

399
00:25:46,774 --> 00:25:50,870
the first thing you need to do is collecting metrics. You cannot

400
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,494
reduce what you cannot measure. So first measure it.

401
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:58,058
Then once you have your metrics of your cpu, ram, et cetera,

402
00:25:58,154 --> 00:26:01,774
you can estimate the power used by those. And then

403
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:05,282
you can even estimate the carbon emissions in term of gram of co

404
00:26:05,336 --> 00:26:09,086
2 /hour once you have that, you can use some tools,

405
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:14,482
some dashboards, some analytics to make

406
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:18,598
some thinking and correlation and come up with

407
00:26:18,684 --> 00:26:22,434
actions reductions, resizing and scheduling

408
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:25,154
according to the intensity of the grid.

409
00:26:25,282 --> 00:26:27,910
And then if you can go cardboard aware.

410
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,046
That's all for me. Thank you very much for listening. If you

411
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:36,726
want to know more, you can send me messages, but you

00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:40,682
can also check the Green Software foundation website. They care very good material

413
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:44,314
on this topic. You can listen to their podcast and I strongly

414
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:49,214
encourage you to also check boavista.org to
