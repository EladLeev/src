00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,630
Are you an sre?

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,358
A developer? A quality

3
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:11,162
engineer who wants to tackle the challenge of improving reliability

4
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:14,970
in your DevOps? You can enable your DevOps for reliability

Chaos native. Litmus Cloud my

7
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:21,714
name is Alicia Nyton, and I'm an engineering team lead at Honeycombio,

8
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:25,542
where I specialize in assisting customers in this sticky but quite

9
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:29,366
satisfying space called observability. I bring customers to

10
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:33,206
the hive, where they are lost, and I help them understand that they're humans,

11
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:36,810
too. My background consists of physics, a little biology,

12
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,166
DevOps engineering, and a splash of trash talking. Today we

13
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,334
will be discussing SLI negotiation tactics for

14
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:48,746
engineers. Service level indicators

15
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:52,658
are quantitative measures of a service, which in turn are

16
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:56,130
measured by slos. Whoa. My apologies.

17
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,598
This is not the talk that you actually think seriously.

18
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:05,242
This is about survival level indicators

19
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:08,470
that are prescribed to everyone who has a pause.

20
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,294
It's a mental measure to indicate, hey, self,

21
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:16,134
am I okay? Like real life okay,

22
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:20,222
if you are flaming dog, this is fine meme

23
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,594
several times throughout the course of the day, then you're not okay.

24
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:27,146
My friend, a person is only great as their best

25
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:31,118
cup of coffee is a fact set approximately by

26
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:34,974
no one. I hope, at least if

27
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:39,438
this has become your mantra of drinking coffee to

28
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:43,810
stay awake and stay alive. Hopefully caffeine is not

29
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,266
this hypothetical liquid that is gluing your eyes open in

30
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:51,010
such a way that it creates pillows for your tiredness.

31
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,682
Well, those are bags, folks, and they're

32
00:02:54,846 --> 00:02:57,560
indicators that you need to get some rest.

33
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,410
This talk is specifically designed

34
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,186
to address engineers.

35
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:09,626
So, slos measure customer

36
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:12,746
success. But if we think

37
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,314
about it, customers are as successful, are only

38
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,802
as successful as the people that we put in front of them

39
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:23,354
and the people that are helping create these systems

40
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:27,102
that they can use and love on a day to day basis. So let's focus

41
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,320
on that for a moment.

42
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,562
So we've talked about survival level

43
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:38,606
indicators for 2 seconds, right? So let's

44
00:03:38,638 --> 00:03:42,526
define that. It's the me factor

45
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:46,070
divided by valid moments. So what is that exactly?

46
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,910
The me factor is basically core values plus

47
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,050
what intrigues you, your mantra, and your tolerance levels.

48
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,054
The me factors are the good parts of you and what you

49
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:01,754
stand for. If at any point in time, your me

50
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:05,238
factor is compromised, then the best parts of you cannot be brought

51
00:04:05,254 --> 00:04:08,922
to the table. Imagine if your job

52
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:12,686
told you something like, hi, you're probably going to have to

53
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,686
miss out on your child's graduation or the

54
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:20,734
trip you've been planning for several months. Yeah, we have

55
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:24,642
things to do, so you can cancel that. I'm pretty sure

56
00:04:24,696 --> 00:04:28,494
you'll go Super Saiyan in the office and are talk smack

57
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,810
in those private back slack channels.

58
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,134
So it's important to keep your me factor in

59
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:40,150
mind and keep those

60
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,430
things in perspective.

61
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,534
So I've talked about the me factor. So what are valid moments?

62
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:51,066
Valid moments are things that you've considered to be

63
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:55,020
justifiable for you. For example,

64
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,126
some people prefer to not have a job that's

65
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:02,826
on call, but maybe in your situation it's okay that you're

66
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:05,934
on call. Or maybe it may be

67
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,162
okay for you to work extra hours temporarily,

68
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,866
as it's something that needs to be done that

69
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,340
will be beneficial later.

70
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,586
So what are invalid moments? Well, my friend, that's up

71
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:23,298
to you. My tolerance on

72
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:26,982
invalid, non justifiable moments is pretty

73
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:30,950
low nowadays. But some may feel otherwise

74
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,158
and that's okay. It's all about your survival, and you

75
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:37,720
should always keep your survival in mind.

76
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,686
So we've gotten our mind around surviving

77
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:47,398
in the workplace and in general. So how do we calibrate

78
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,310
that? Well, I want to provide a few tips for that.

79
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,298
So let's define mutualistic expectations.

80
00:05:54,474 --> 00:05:58,670
So as soon as you humanly can define your expectations

81
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,442
and then calibrate them. As dynamic as life

82
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,282
is, so are adults. We have

83
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:10,770
needs, whether it's wanting to be a part of leadership,

84
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,802
having more technical challenges at work, or easier workload,

85
00:06:15,886 --> 00:06:19,350
especially if you're doing a job of nine people, et cetera.

86
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,214
Hey, boss, I'm tired of your shit is

87
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:28,410
definitely not a way to approach your boss

88
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,806
yet. You may want to indicate to your boss

89
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:36,554
that I see myself in x situation and

90
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:40,234
I feel that I'm in X place. Do you

91
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:44,170
agree? This sparks the conversation of discovering

92
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,542
where you are and where you can go. And it also gets

93
00:06:48,596 --> 00:06:52,286
your boss thinking, hey, this person is actually thinking about this and

94
00:06:52,308 --> 00:06:55,860
it's proactive. So let's approach these things together.

95
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,946
This works the other way around as well. And what I mean

96
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:04,610
by that is, as a boss, it's not cool to

97
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,054
force someone into leadership, yet it's totally cool

98
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:12,726
to encourage them and to ask the person where

99
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:16,038
would they like to be and what are their current

100
00:07:16,124 --> 00:07:19,900
limitations. At work, you never know until you ask someone

101
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,300
what's going on. And this is a good way to approach that.

102
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,254
There's a great way to define basic expectations so

103
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:33,326
you can do something like a readme of

104
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:36,606
yourself, to introduce yourself to people so they

105
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:39,360
know how you work, what your values are,

106
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,786
ways to reach you. That's okay and plausible for

107
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:48,898
you, et cetera. This is a way to set

108
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:52,402
boundaries in a very meaningful way with people

109
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:55,380
understanding who you are at a very basic level.

110
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,934
The next thing I want to talk about is calibrating no

111
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:05,190
meeting Wednesdays. So if you understand

112
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,050
this concept or you have it, stick to it.

113
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,442
If you don't have it, please create

114
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:16,330
it. The notion of picking a day without a meeting without

115
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,118
meetings is the beginning of something

116
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:22,670
beautiful and it provides a sense of normalcy.

117
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,782
You can drive your productivity throughout the day without

118
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:30,030
being distracted.

119
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,242
Defining weekly tasks spend

120
00:08:36,296 --> 00:08:41,666
a little time during working hours at

121
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:45,974
the beginning of the work week or towards the end of the previous work

122
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:50,150
week to calibrate your calendar for the upcoming days.

123
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,374
You can determine which tasks are

124
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:57,910
actually required for the week as well as

125
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,610
the level of detail and attention it requires.

126
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,806
Not all of the meetings on your calendar at times require

127
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,446
you to be there, and so you can gauge that to taken free up

128
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:14,094
yourself and have that sense of clarity to

129
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:18,842
allow yourself that ability to prioritize

130
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:23,070
without jamming up your time. Hobby fishing

131
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,380
sparking up with a hobby is a way to give yourself,

132
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,826
literally yourself, something to look forward to that has nothing to

133
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:35,422
do with work. This is the time to think about yourself

134
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:40,360
and fine tune that me factor myself.

135
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,810
I just purchased a Kamado grill and so I'm

136
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,546
planning on being a grill guru. Have no idea how this

137
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:53,366
is going to work, but I've done all of this research and time and I've

138
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:58,746
constructed on what I want to do. And so when

139
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:02,254
I need to formulate what I want to do

140
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:05,726
outside of work, this provides that foreground. To do

141
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:09,166
that without putting busy, meaningless tasks in front of me.

142
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:12,320
This is something that I really want to do and

143
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,930
right now this is my yoga.

144
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,066
Nudge your friends. So being healthy for

145
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:23,614
yourself also requires those around you to be healthy

146
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:27,720
as well. So tap your friend.

147
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,198
They may actually need it. I've had work friends

148
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:35,926
previously who've cried out

149
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:38,950
for help, indirectly, directly,

150
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,410
whatever the case may be, sending out smoke signals.

151
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,666
Typically I'd sense them and I may nudge them back and

152
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,810
say, hey, would you like to participate

153
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,560
in doing something non work related on Zoom for 30 minutes?

154
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,960
And this is simply because work has been challenging and

155
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,134
they may not know how to depress or they may not

156
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:06,274
know how to reach out. And this is a way,

157
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:10,002
if they're your friend, this is a way to do so. Also,

158
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:13,586
as a friend, if someone hasn't taken off that

159
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:16,920
you know of, whether they're your friend or not, to be honest,

160
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,774
tell them to take off. It's quite okay to do that.

161
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:24,262
Life happens regardless if they're at work,

162
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:28,426
not, and the work will be there regardless. And your sanity may

163
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:31,930
not always be there. If required,

164
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,794
suggest places for them to go. And this

165
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:40,690
may also be an opportunity to get to know a person as well. Who knows?

166
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,510
Sometimes people need to be reminded from humans that show general

167
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,758
interest in them that it's okay

168
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:51,502
to think about yourself, to think about your mental health,

169
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,970
to think about your survival.

170
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,210
So the last part here for me is tasting the gumbo.

171
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,606
So I'm from Louisiana, so any chance I get,

172
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:07,840
I love to throw a splash of Louisiana in there.

173
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,838
So if we look at the me factor as a gumbo,

174
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:15,730
there are many ingredients in the me factor that define a person.

175
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,698
Besides calibrating yourself, there could be moments where the components

176
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:23,654
have changed. So gauge yourself

177
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:27,654
and taste those ingredients to ensure that the components that make

178
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:30,918
up who you are as a great worker, friend, parent,

179
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:35,020
lover, et cetera, are still flavorful to not only

180
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,906
yourself, but to others as well. I mean, people have to

181
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:42,362
love you and stomach you to a certain degree. No one is perfect,

182
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:46,046
so use your experiences and feedback to add a little salt to

183
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:49,502
your recipe. Check yourself before you break yourself,

184
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,722
if you're familiar with that terminology, surviving is about patience

185
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:56,670
and endurance under the right circumstances.

186
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,054
If your job is no longer for you based on your expectations

187
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:02,980
and needs, that's okay people.

188
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,820
Sometimes we outgrow the seasons that we use.

189
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,700
Have those conversations with your boss to see if it's feasible to

190
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,966
add this to your gumbo. Or is it suitable to replace

191
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:19,954
that seasoning with something more complementary? This tech

192
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:23,574
stuff that's always easy. Life is hard but challenging

193
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:26,570
and rewarding, so let's make sure we're all surviving.

194
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,710
Thanks for joining.
