00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,322
Hi everyone, welcome to the session

2
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:27,014
dedicated to ethics for quant computing. We will go through

3
00:00:27,052 --> 00:00:30,662
the different aspects of ethics in the

4
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:32,390
technological environment.

5
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,646
Quantum information technologies covering

6
00:00:37,698 --> 00:00:42,118
quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing

7
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:45,962
are among the most significant technologies to emerge in

8
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:49,962
recent decades, offering the promise of

9
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:54,010
paratic mishifting computational capacity with significant

10
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,440
ethical consequences. On a technical level,

11
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,946
the unique features of quantum information processing

12
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:06,462
have consequences for the imposition of fairness and ethical

13
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:10,594
constraints on computation. It may seem too early

14
00:01:10,712 --> 00:01:14,530
to worry about the ethical implication of quantum computing

15
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,046
given the lack of evolution as

16
00:01:19,068 --> 00:01:22,966
to when it will see widespread use

17
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:26,120
of quantum computing. However,

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,722
now is a perfect time. Consider how

19
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:33,974
quickly machine learning was embedded into business processes

20
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:38,070
before most understood how damaging

21
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,670
it could be to an organization, customer and reputation.

22
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,114
Without a top down mandate for ethical development

23
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:51,070
of quantum computing, technologists might meet

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,674
business objective or their creations could

25
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:58,210
lead to unintended ethical fraud consequences.

26
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,402
We can situate quantum ethics at the

27
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:07,078
cross disciplinary intersection of

28
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:11,110
quantum information science, technology ethics

29
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,294
and moral philosophy to

30
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:20,646
assess the impact of this incoming

31
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:24,458
emerging technology. The four area

32
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:28,710
that we are going to high level explore

33
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,430
is safety, security, privacy, and fairness.

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,160
The development of public key cryptographies

35
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,092
is in the was

36
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:50,136
revolutionary, enabling new ways of computing

37
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:53,820
securely. However, public key

38
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,244
algorithms are vulnerable to

39
00:02:57,282 --> 00:03:01,084
quantum attacks because they derive their strength

40
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:05,330
from the difficulties of solving discrete log problem

41
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,040
or factoring large integers.

42
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,500
As discovered by mathematician Peter Shaw,

43
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,740
these types of problems can be solved very quickly using

44
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,830
a sufficiently strong quantum computer.

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,544
So in the case of asymmetric or public key

46
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:27,112
cryptography, we need new math that will

47
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,920
stand up to quantum attacks because today's public

48
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,520
key algorithms will be completely broken.

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,860
Grover's algorithm,

50
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,296
from the scientist love Grover,

51
00:03:44,488 --> 00:03:48,356
is a quantum search algorithm. Using Grover's

52
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:52,140
algorithm, some symmetric algorithms

53
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,640
are impacted and some are broken.

54
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,450
Key size and message digest size

55
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,644
are important consideration that will

56
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:06,336
factor into whether an algorithm is quantum safe

57
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:10,996
or not. For example, use of

58
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:15,560
advanced encryption standard AES

59
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,640
with 256 bit keys

60
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,600
is considered quantum safe,

61
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,804
but Tripol codes can be

62
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:30,270
broken no matter the key size.

63
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,430
And that is true for symmetric algorithms that usually

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,528
are utilized by the banking industry or

65
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,770
the asymmetric algorithms used

66
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,664
for publicly and private key for

67
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:53,508
instance, automotive connected cars for vehicle to everything

68
00:04:53,674 --> 00:04:58,260
type of communications will be easily broken.

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,804
Just it must be first noted

70
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:11,210
that publicly crypto system work

71
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:19,366
against classical computing attacks and

72
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:23,494
has been traditionally estimated through so

73
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:27,400
called bits of security level.

74
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,706
Such a level is defined as the effort required by

75
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:35,420
a classical computer to perform a brute force attack.

76
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,178
For instance, an asymmetric crypto system

77
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:42,140
has 1024 bit security.

78
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,254
When the effort required to attack it with

79
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:49,902
a classical computer is similar to the one needed

80
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:54,254
to carry out a brute force attack on 1024

81
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,094
bit cryptography key. As a reference

82
00:05:58,142 --> 00:06:00,050
in the table here in the chart,

83
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,106
the table indicates the security level of some

84
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:08,834
of the most popular symmetric and asymmetric

85
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:10,120
crypto system.

86
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,694
The cost of breaking current 80 bit

87
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:21,318
security crypto system with classical computers

88
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:25,850
is estimated to be between tens of thousands

89
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,660
and hundreds of millions of dollars.

90
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,582
In the case of 112 bit crypto system,

91
00:06:34,736 --> 00:06:38,958
they are continued to be secure to classical computing attacks for

92
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,646
the next 30 40 years. However,

93
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:45,650
researchers have determined that

94
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,242
160 bit elliptic curves can

95
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:54,260
be broken with a 1000 qubit quantum computer,

96
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,000
while a 1024 bit

97
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,294
RSA will need roughly 2000

98
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,970
qubits. Such a treat affect

99
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,246
not only crypto systems that rely on integer factorization

100
00:07:12,438 --> 00:07:16,150
or elliptic curves, but also orders

101
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,494
based on problems like the discrete logarithm

102
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:23,214
problem, which can be solved fast through the

103
00:07:23,252 --> 00:07:25,310
shores algorithm.

104
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,464
An example is blockchain and also other distributed ledger

105
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:36,972
technologies have evolved significantly in the last

106
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:40,444
years and their use has been suggested for numerous

107
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:43,468
applications due to their ability to provide transparency,

108
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,672
redundancy, accountability and so on.

109
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:50,324
In the case of blockchain, such characteristics are

110
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:54,160
provided through public key cryptography and hash

111
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,616
functions. However, the fast progress of quantum

112
00:07:57,648 --> 00:08:01,104
computing is opening the possibility of performing attacks

113
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:05,096
based on Grover's enshore's algorithms in the near future.

114
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:09,092
Such algorithms treat in both public key cryptography

115
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:13,492
and ash functions, forcing to redesign blockchains

116
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:17,164
to make use of crypto systems that

117
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,580
withstand quantum attacks,

118
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,692
thus creating which are known as

119
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:28,332
post quantum, post quantum

120
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:32,188
proof, quantum safe quantum resistant crypto

121
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:35,120
systems for such a purpose.

122
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,010
There are several studies going on

123
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,164
to set the state of the art on post quantum crystal system

124
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:48,004
and how they can apply to blockchains and

125
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:48,980
DTL.

126
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,914
A definition of quantum shape cryptography is

127
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:03,642
important. I take as example the one of

128
00:09:03,696 --> 00:09:07,500
european telecommunications standard institute is not the only one.

129
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,294
Cryptography helps to provide security for many

130
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:15,278
everyday tasks. When you send an email, make an online

131
00:09:15,364 --> 00:09:20,030
purchase or make a withdrawal from an ATM machine,

132
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,986
cryptography helps keep your data

133
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:27,410
private and authenticate your identity.

134
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,886
Today's modern cryptography algorithms derive

135
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:35,498
their strength from the difficulties of solving certain math

136
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,886
problems using classical computers or the

137
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:42,194
difficulty of searching for the right secret

138
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:45,634
key or message. Quantum computers,

139
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:48,860
however, work in a fundamentally different way.

140
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,062
Solving a problem that might take millions of years on a classical

141
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:57,734
computer could take hours or minutes on a sufficiently

142
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,580
large quantum computer,

143
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,858
which will have a significant impact on the encryption,

144
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:09,134
ashing and public key algorithms we are

145
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:13,246
using today. This is where quantum

146
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,154
safe cryptography comes in

147
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:21,038
quantum safe cryptography refers to efforts

148
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:24,446
to identify algorithms that are resistant

149
00:10:24,478 --> 00:10:28,802
to attacks by both classical and quantum computers

150
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:33,286
to keep information assets secure even after

151
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:37,000
a larger scale quantum computer has been built.

152
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,730
The picture over here out of the white

153
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,678
paper number eight of the European

154
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:48,860
Telecommunication Standard Institute shows that

155
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,920
without specific action in 2025,

156
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,654
the quantum computing techniques will be in

157
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:02,174
condition to expose exponentially the

158
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:07,490
risk for the current cryptography solutions.

159
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:17,442
Just a shot

160
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:20,882
on a study running in this moment on the Cambridge

161
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:24,150
Quantum Institute

162
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,906
that is delivering a

163
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:32,934
quantum cryptography based on the quantum

164
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:37,130
physics moving from math

165
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,618
into physics using photons

166
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:47,726
to transmit over fiber optics wires the

167
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:52,430
binary keys through specific polarizations,

168
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,942
the properties of quantum mechanics particles

169
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:02,386
can exist in more than one place or state at the

170
00:12:02,408 --> 00:12:06,574
same time, a quantum property cannot be observed

171
00:12:06,702 --> 00:12:09,220
without changing or disturbing it.

172
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,754
Wool particles cannot be copied allows

173
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:18,870
to create a sort of cryptography

174
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,450
that if a third party between two

175
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,450
communicating intervening

176
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,054
changes or disturbs the communication and that

177
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:38,960
is easily evident first

178
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,638
and modify the communication so practically

179
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:47,294
is impossible for a third party to intervene.

180
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:50,754
It's just a flash. Just to show how the things

181
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:54,142
are evolving rapidly and in a different path.

182
00:12:54,286 --> 00:12:56,130
Also for cryptography,

183
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,930
let's take a look now on for instance,

184
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,930
what NIST, the US Institute

185
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,330
of Standard of and Technology is

186
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,474
working in this moment. They have launched a

187
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:16,278
challenge to provide solutions

188
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:20,814
and they have selected four solution for

189
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:24,750
general encryption and for digital signature.

190
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,830
The algorithms are designed the selected one

191
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,854
for two main tasks for which encryption

192
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:37,154
is typically used. General encryption is used to protect information

193
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:41,134
exchanged across a public network and digital

194
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:45,086
signature instead is used for identity authentication.

195
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,254
Just to summarize, all four of the algorithms were

196
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:54,386
created by experts collaborating with multiple countries

197
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:56,390
and institutions.

198
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,302
For general encryption used when we access secure

199
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:04,742
websites, NIST has selected

200
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:06,730
the crystal skyber.

201
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,498
Among its advantage are comparatively

202
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:15,690
small encryption keys that two parties can exchange

203
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:19,550
easily as well as its speed of operation

204
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,874
for digital signature, often used when we need to

205
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:27,966
verify identities during a digital transaction

206
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,862
or to sign a document remotely.

207
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:34,370
NIST has selected the three algorithms,

208
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,214
crystal dilithium, Falcon and

209
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,666
Sphinx plus. Reviewers noted

210
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,906
that the high efficiency of the first two and NST

211
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:50,234
recommends crystal's dilithium as

212
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:54,762
the primary algorithm with Falcon for application

213
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:58,780
that need a smaller signature tool than delisium can provide.

214
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,074
The third, sphinx plus, is somewhat larger

215
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:07,898
and slower than the other two, but is valuable

216
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:11,486
as a backup for one main reason,

217
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:16,354
it is based on a different math than

218
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:20,158
all three of NST's order selection

219
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:21,060
used.

220
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,046
Three of the selected algorithms are based on a

221
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:31,074
family of math problems called structure,

222
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:35,110
lattices while sphinx plus uses

223
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,750
hash functions.

224
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,674
There are other algorithms still under consideration that

225
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:46,438
are defines for general encryption.

226
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:50,846
Do not use structured lattices or ash function

227
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:55,294
in their approaches. While the standard is

228
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:59,194
in development, NIST encourages security experts

229
00:15:59,322 --> 00:16:03,050
to explore the new algorithms and consider how their

230
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,846
application will use them, but not to bake

231
00:16:06,878 --> 00:16:10,878
them into the system yet, as the algorithms

232
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:14,338
could change slightly before the standard is

233
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:16,790
finalized is finalized.

234
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,676
Every organization though should prepare to

235
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,992
this evolution. This chart shows

236
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:35,944
a suggestion out of the IBM introduction to

237
00:16:35,982 --> 00:16:39,416
quantum safe for instance. So not

238
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:42,596
only public or government organization

239
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:46,444
are working on it, suggesting customer or

240
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:50,380
suggesting users to prepare themselves to

241
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,104
the quantum computer arrival. For instance,

242
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:57,264
when meeting with clients getting started

243
00:16:57,462 --> 00:17:00,080
on their journey to quantum safety,

244
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,524
IBM shares a few of the key milestones

245
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:08,720
to help them to get ready to adopt new quantum safe standards.

246
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,004
First, discover and classify data

247
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:17,732
the first step involves classifying the value of

248
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,820
data and understanding compliance requirements.

249
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,240
This helps to create a data inventory,

250
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,408
then the creation of a

251
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:34,316
crypto inventory because once you

252
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:38,284
have classified your data, you will need to identify how

253
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:42,284
your data is encrypted as well as other

254
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:45,790
uses of cryptography to create

255
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,432
a crypto environment that will help

256
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,492
you during your migration planning. Your crypto inventory

257
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:58,880
will include information like encryption protocols,

258
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,056
symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, key lengths,

259
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:05,350
crypto providers and so on.

260
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,340
The third step is to embrace

261
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,360
so called crypto agility.

262
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,396
The transition to quantum safe standards will be a multiyear journey

263
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:23,316
as standards evolve and vendors

264
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:25,790
move to adopt a quantum safe technology,

265
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,420
use a flexible approach and be prepared to make replacements

266
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,996
is key, so it's necessary to

267
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:39,872
implement a hybrid approach as recommended by

268
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:43,568
several industry experts. By using both

269
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:48,028
classical and quantum safe cryptographic algorithms. This maintains

270
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:51,524
compliance with current standards while

271
00:18:51,722 --> 00:18:53,860
adding quantum safe protection.

272
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,508
We have time to implement quantum safe solution before

273
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:03,560
the advent of large scale quantum computing, but not much

274
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,144
time. Moving to new cryptography is

275
00:19:07,182 --> 00:19:11,320
complex and will require significant time and investment.

276
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,096
We don't know when a large scale quantum computer capable of breaking

277
00:19:15,128 --> 00:19:17,790
public key cryptography algorithms will be available.

278
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,524
Experts predict that could be possible by the

279
00:19:24,562 --> 00:19:28,304
end of this decade. Honestly, IBM has

280
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:32,096
just released a pay as you go

281
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:36,240
cloud based quantum capability

282
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,900
at 125 qubits, which serve to be

283
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,340
a significant capability.

284
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,272
So we can expect to rapidly evolve

285
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:51,736
into a much larger quantum computing available to

286
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:55,528
everybody. Let's move now into

287
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:58,520
a different type of ethical concern,

288
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,144
the distribution of computer power. The benefit that

289
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:06,344
could come with the power of quantum computing are frequently

290
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:09,624
discussed. The power of quantum

291
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:13,356
computing can be leveraged for bad purposes as

292
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,656
well as good, and even when organisations have the

293
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:20,364
best intention, there are potential downsides

294
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:23,756
that must be considered. For instance,

295
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:27,456
the access. It is unlikely a typical person or

296
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:31,168
smaller company will ever own a quantum computer due

297
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:33,940
to their physical and technical complexity,

298
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,104
but that doesn't mean they can't benefit governments

299
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:42,856
and organizations. We have seen IBM that want to move

300
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:47,352
everyone along the technology adoption curve in

301
00:20:47,406 --> 00:20:51,224
an equitable way should think about how

302
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:55,128
to share knowledge of quantum computing.

303
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:59,304
The bias and the fairness due

304
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:03,128
to the beyond classical capability

305
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:09,072
of quantum computing, quantum machine learning is

306
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:12,684
applied independently or embedded

307
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:15,570
in classical models for decision making,

308
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,960
especially in the field of finance.

309
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,204
Fairness and other ethical issues are

310
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,710
often one of the main concern in decision making.

311
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,732
We need to define a formal framework for the fairness,

312
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:37,048
verification and analysis of quantum machine learning

313
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:38,680
decision models,

314
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,096
where we adopt one of the most popular

315
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:47,752
notion of fairness in the literature.

316
00:21:47,896 --> 00:21:49,580
Based on the intuition,

317
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,708
any two similar individuals must

318
00:21:55,794 --> 00:21:59,360
be treated similarly and are

319
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,440
therefore system are unbiased.

320
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,224
Quantum noise can improve fairness and develop an

321
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:12,196
algorithm to check with whether a

322
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:15,396
quantum machine learning model is fair. In particular,

323
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:19,904
there are algorithms that can find bias

324
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:23,672
kernels of quantum data during

325
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:27,108
the checking. These bias kernels

326
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:30,900
generates infinitely many bias pairs

327
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:35,016
for investigating the unfairness of

328
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,248
the model. For example,

329
00:22:38,334 --> 00:22:42,108
Google has algorithms designed based on a

330
00:22:42,274 --> 00:22:46,620
highly efficient data structure, the tensor networks,

331
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,640
and implemented on

332
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,280
Google's Tensorflow quantum.

333
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,940
The utility and effectiveness of those algorithms

334
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,224
are confirmed by the experimental results,

335
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:08,896
including income prediction and credit scoring

336
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:12,840
on real worth data for

337
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,500
a class of random quantum

338
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,792
decision model with just 27

339
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:25,960
qubit dimensional state tripling

340
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,720
that of the state of the art algorithms

341
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,660
for verifying quantum machine learning models.

342
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,650
As discussed in, an important issue in classical machine learning

343
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,376
is how fair is the

344
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:51,076
decision made by machines. The same issues

345
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,510
exist for quantum machine learning.

346
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,364
You may see that the fairness of quantum decision model

347
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:05,492
is to treat all input states

348
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:09,496
equally. An example there

349
00:24:09,518 --> 00:24:13,064
is not a pair of two close input states that

350
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:18,060
has a large difference between their corresponding outcomes.

351
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,144
The bias can impact the

352
00:24:32,182 --> 00:24:37,060
performances. Algorithms are

353
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,380
increasingly engaged in economically important decisions.

354
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,116
They are used to make decisions regarding sentences in

355
00:24:46,138 --> 00:24:49,880
criminal courts, resume screening,

356
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,932
pricing, advertising placement,

357
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,984
lending decision, and the news in

358
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:03,000
the media that citizen consume. This development

359
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,240
has generated a public debate about bias and unfairness

360
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,116
in machine guided decisions, including several high

361
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:14,028
profile allegations in finance, criminal sentencing,

362
00:25:14,124 --> 00:25:18,290
hiring, advertising targeting and so on.

363
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,696
Fairness concern have

364
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:27,424
resonated with policymakers in multiple

365
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:31,040
countries who have adopted or are considering fairness

366
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,756
related regulations for algorithms. We will see

367
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:37,430
later on the european approach on that,

368
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,010
but the bias are also in data.

369
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,810
When training a quantum system,

370
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,376
there can be potential biases in the data used, which can impact

371
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:53,630
the performance and fairness of this system.

372
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,828
For instance, sample bias. If the training data

373
00:25:58,994 --> 00:26:02,336
used for quantum systems is not representative of the

374
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:06,044
diverse range of inputs of scenarios

375
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:09,184
that the system may encounter in the real world,

376
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:12,850
it can result in biased outcomes. For example,

377
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,868
if the training data predominantly represents a particular

378
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:20,048
demographic or specific experimental conditions,

379
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:24,036
the system may not generalize well to other groups or

380
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:27,828
situations. The labeling

381
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:31,352
bias typical of machine learning, the process

382
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:35,204
of labeling data for training quantum system can introduce

383
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:38,484
biases. Human annotators

384
00:26:38,612 --> 00:26:41,756
may unintentionally label data based on

385
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:44,536
their own perspective or preconception,

386
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:48,300
leading to biased training sets.

387
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,884
This can result in unfair or discriminatory

388
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:57,824
outcomes when the system is applied to

389
00:26:57,862 --> 00:27:01,264
real world situations and we

390
00:27:01,302 --> 00:27:04,572
should consider also the historical bias. If the training

391
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:08,144
data reflects historical biases and inequities,

392
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:12,116
the quantum system may in

393
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:16,176
advert without us knowing,

394
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:19,988
learn and perpetuate those biases.

395
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:24,388
For instance, if historical data exhibits disparities

396
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:28,120
in representation or opportunities for certain groups,

397
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,888
the trained system may reproduce or amplify such biases,

398
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:35,660
leading to discriminatory outcomes.

399
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,044
To prevent perpetuating biases and

400
00:27:40,162 --> 00:27:43,264
inequities, it is crucial to

401
00:27:43,302 --> 00:27:47,520
promote diverse and inclusive development processes.

402
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,520
Therefore, the suggestion is

403
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,460
to through the so called representation

404
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,220
includes diverse

405
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,804
practices and voices in the

406
00:28:04,842 --> 00:28:08,424
development of quantum system that helps in

407
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:12,280
capturing a broader range of experiences and

408
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,188
reducing, not eliminating,

409
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:19,204
bias. Diverse teams can identify

410
00:28:19,332 --> 00:28:23,196
and rectify biases in the training data,

411
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:27,740
improving fairness and equity in the system performance.

412
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,960
Ethical guidelines establishing ethical

413
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,064
guidelines and principle during the development process

414
00:28:38,262 --> 00:28:42,480
ensures that biases and inequities

415
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,760
are actively addressed.

416
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,096
These guidelines should promote fairness, transparency,

417
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:54,020
accountability and should be followed throughout the system

418
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,540
design, training and deployment stages.

419
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,544
They can or should be defined by

420
00:29:01,582 --> 00:29:05,176
any organization internally for

421
00:29:05,358 --> 00:29:07,796
quantum activities,

422
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:11,720
also artificial intelligence activities, but they stay in quantum

423
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,252
data collection. Collecting a diverse and inclusive data

424
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:19,884
set that adequately represents the

425
00:29:19,922 --> 00:29:22,460
target population is vital.

426
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,320
It is essential to consider factors like demographic diversity,

427
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,572
socioeconomic background, and regional variation

428
00:29:32,636 --> 00:29:36,528
to ensure the system is trained on a comprehensive

429
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,790
and unbiased data set.

430
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,404
Bias detection and mitigation what

431
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:49,012
is is regularly assessing

432
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:52,756
the quantum system for bias and developing techniques

433
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:56,040
to mitigate them is crucial.

434
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,590
This can involve techniques such as fairness aware learning,

435
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,144
debiasing algorithm, or including

436
00:30:05,192 --> 00:30:08,190
fairness metric during the evaluation process.

437
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,000
We shouldn't forget external review and auditing.

438
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,464
Encouraging external reviews and audits of

439
00:30:18,502 --> 00:30:22,492
quantum system helps in identifying and rectifying

440
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:26,656
biases. Independent scrutiny ensures

441
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:30,864
that the system is valued from multiple perspectives

442
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:34,852
and can help mitigate any biases or

443
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:38,824
unfairness that may have been missed during

444
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:42,712
the development process. In summary, diverse and

445
00:30:42,766 --> 00:30:46,504
inclusive development is

446
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:50,536
necessary to are necessary to prevent

447
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,476
the perpetuation of biases and inequities in

448
00:30:54,498 --> 00:31:01,630
quantum system exist

449
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,242
risk that are exacerbating by

450
00:31:06,376 --> 00:31:13,378
the utilization of quantum data

451
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:17,054
harvesting and private in the past several

452
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:20,966
years, there have been major passes to protect

453
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:25,506
data private and ensure

454
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:30,306
artificial intelligence technologies are being used fairly

455
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:32,940
and in a ways that benefit the public.

456
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,638
Despite these off efforts, rampant data collection

457
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:41,574
still take place. Since future quantum

458
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:45,054
computers will be able to process large

459
00:31:45,252 --> 00:31:49,690
volumes of data more rapidly than today's most sophisticated

460
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,210
service, the availability of quantum computing

461
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,502
could further incentivize organisations to collect

462
00:31:57,566 --> 00:32:02,590
even more consumer data, therefore supercharging

463
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,066
the data harvesting that already

464
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:09,734
takes place. But I'm key on

465
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:13,686
explainability quantum computers, and especially

466
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:17,442
quantum machine learning, presents the ultimate

467
00:32:17,506 --> 00:32:21,654
black box problem. Machine learning developers are familiar

468
00:32:21,702 --> 00:32:25,302
with this issue and deep learning neural networks

469
00:32:25,366 --> 00:32:29,686
are notoriously opaque. With quantum computers,

470
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:33,034
explainability is more of a physics

471
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:36,894
problems than a programming problem. It will

472
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:40,606
be difficult to evaluate and judge the decision making process of

473
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:44,710
quantum algorithms because they will recognize even more complex

474
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:48,706
patterns across even more data points

475
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:51,170
than today's machine learning models.

476
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,214
Environmentally, we have also to

477
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:03,800
consider that all these things we are speaking in this moment

478
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,200
are bringing effect.

479
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:13,034
In particular, quantum computers have the potential to

480
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:17,146
revolutionize computing capabilities, but they also come with

481
00:33:17,248 --> 00:33:21,770
significant energy requirements and potential environment impacts.

482
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,870
In this chart there is an overview of the energy requirements.

483
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,094
Quantum computers operate at extremely low

484
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:34,030
temperatures to maintain the delicate quantum states

485
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,646
of their qubits. Cooling systems, such as cryogenic

486
00:33:37,678 --> 00:33:40,994
refrigerators, are necessary to achieve and maintain this

487
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:44,878
low temperature. The cooling process itself consumes

488
00:33:44,974 --> 00:33:48,510
significant amount of energy. Additionally, the computational

489
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,970
operation performed by quantum computers can be

490
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,602
energy intensive, depending on the arbor architecture.

491
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:59,190
On the complexity of the algorithms being executed,

492
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,566
there is an environmental impact. The energy consumption of quantum

493
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:08,358
computers can have environmental implication primarily

494
00:34:08,454 --> 00:34:12,438
through greenhouse gas emission and contributions

495
00:34:12,534 --> 00:34:16,650
to climate change. The energy generation

496
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,702
required to power quantum computing facilities can

497
00:34:20,756 --> 00:34:24,126
rely on nonrenewable sources like

498
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:28,238
fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide

499
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,602
and other greenhouse gases when

500
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:34,366
burned. Moreover,

501
00:34:34,558 --> 00:34:39,374
the manufacturing processes for quantum computing may

502
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:43,014
also have environmental impacts due to the

503
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:46,178
extraction and processing of raw materials

504
00:34:46,274 --> 00:34:49,110
as well as waste generation.

505
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,842
It is important to know that the quantum computers are still in the early

506
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:58,474
stages of development and their energy efficiency is

507
00:34:58,512 --> 00:35:01,590
not yet on par with classical computers.

508
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,360
Classical computers, which power most

509
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,550
of our current computational infrastructure,

510
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,074
have benefited from decades of optimization

511
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:17,550
and advancements in energy efficiency.

512
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:21,266
Quantum computers have a long way to go in

513
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:25,342
terms of reducing their energy requirements and possibly

514
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:29,118
improving the energy efficiency to become

515
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:32,646
more sustainable. So to

516
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:33,800
mitigate that,

517
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,510
we can pursue several strategies.

518
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,914
Energy efficiency research continued research and

519
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:50,070
development efforts should focus on improving the energy efficiencies

520
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,166
of quantum computing. This include optimizing

521
00:35:54,198 --> 00:35:57,962
the design architecture of hardware components,

522
00:35:58,106 --> 00:36:01,594
reducing the energy required for cooling, and developing

523
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:05,390
more efficient algorithms to minimize computational operations.

524
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,594
Renewable energy integration promoting the

525
00:36:10,632 --> 00:36:14,210
use of renewable energy sources such as

526
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,014
solar, wind, and hydroelectric

527
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:21,734
power to meet the energy demands for

528
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:25,522
quantum computing can significantly reduce

529
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:28,070
the environmental impact.

530
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,646
Investing in renewable energy infrastructure ensures

531
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:37,078
that the energy consumed consumed by quantum computers

532
00:36:37,254 --> 00:36:40,410
comes from sustainable sources,

533
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,914
but lifecycle assessment conducting comprehensive lifecycle

534
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:48,382
assessment of quantum computing can

535
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:52,090
help identify and mitigate environmental impacts.

536
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:56,758
This assessment should consider not only the energy consumption during operation,

537
00:36:56,874 --> 00:37:01,086
but also the energy and the resource required

538
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:04,654
during manufacturing, transportation, disposal of the hardware,

539
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:08,206
and so on. That is bringing

540
00:37:08,238 --> 00:37:11,910
to a circular economy. Implementing recycle

541
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,674
and waste management for quantum computing hardware

542
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:20,134
can minimize the environmental impact associated with

543
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:21,910
their production disposal.

544
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:27,078
Emphasizing a circular economy approach

545
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:31,334
can promote the reuse and recycling of material,

546
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:35,606
reducing the need for raw material extraction, and minimize waste

547
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:38,618
generation. Of course,

548
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:43,290
policies and standard are relevant because government and regulatory

549
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,806
codes can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable

550
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:50,290
practices in the development and operation

551
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,330
for quantum computing. Implementing energy

552
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,362
efficiency standards, incentivizing the use of renewable energy,

553
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:03,314
and supporting reserves and development for sustainable

554
00:38:03,362 --> 00:38:07,590
quantum technologies that can have a significant positive impact.

555
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,758
Addressing the energy requirements and environmental impact

556
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:15,322
of quantum computing is essential for their

557
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,854
long term viability and adoption. By focusing

558
00:38:18,902 --> 00:38:22,678
on energy efficiency, renewable energy integration,

559
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:26,686
lifecycle assessment, recycling, and policy

560
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:30,922
initiative, we can work toward ensuring

561
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:34,910
that quantum computing technology align with global

562
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,150
sustainability goals.

563
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,210
Let's speak briefly on the ethical framework

564
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:48,626
out of the European Artificial Intelligence act

565
00:38:48,728 --> 00:38:52,280
that has been approved on the 15

566
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,858
June by the European

567
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:01,494
Community and now is in process to be adopted by the

568
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:04,906
different countries in Europe, probably before the end of

569
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,534
the year, is focusing

570
00:39:08,582 --> 00:39:12,474
on artificial intelligence, but will have effect also

571
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:17,790
in quantum computing use for

572
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,834
specifically application. The goal is to enable Europe

573
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:25,950
to lead a correct approach to any kind of artificial intelligence

574
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,470
and identify prohibited high risk areas

575
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,218
that need to be monitored and should

576
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:38,434
be regulated to

577
00:39:38,472 --> 00:39:42,082
avoid conflicts and legal problems. In addition,

578
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:45,474
they want to protect the rights of european citizens.

579
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:49,810
Where laws are generally stricter and more restrictive

580
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,170
than, for instance, in United States or elsewhere,

581
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,370
there is a clear difficulty in regulating

582
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,958
technological changes. The risk of obsolete

583
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:07,302
given the speed of technology innovation

584
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:08,220
is high.

585
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,194
A very well prepared flowchart

586
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:18,642
that describe all the effect of this

587
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:22,114
act, including a portion that

588
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:25,618
can be applies for quantum computing, is in a

589
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:29,406
flowchart published by Vargas and Salman. I put

590
00:40:29,448 --> 00:40:33,446
over here the reference I would suggest for people interested

591
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:38,326
to go through that for us we stay in

592
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:42,150
this session just on the not admitted activities

593
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:46,780
which are protecting one of

594
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,234
the things we have mentioned at the beginning, mainly the

595
00:40:52,272 --> 00:40:56,400
private and the fairness of the application

596
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,666
of technology. Therefore, real time remote

597
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:05,582
biometric identification system in

598
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:09,842
public accessible spaces is not

599
00:41:09,896 --> 00:41:13,710
admitted. Post remote biometric

600
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,340
identification system as well,

601
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,870
categorization based on biometric

602
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,030
using sensitive characteristics,

603
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,070
gender, race, ethnicity and so on are forbidden.

604
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:35,718
Even predictive policing system based on profiling

605
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:38,490
location or past criminal behavior.

606
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,230
Emotion recognition system in

607
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,174
law enforcement, border management, workplace and

608
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:51,966
educational institution. And we

609
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:56,362
should not forget the indiscriminate

610
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:59,300
scraping of biometric data from social media.

611
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,362
All these things are not admitted. Of course,

612
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:07,314
the use of quantum computing may reinforce this

613
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:12,182
kind of activity, so the influence on quantum computing is

614
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:15,960
evident. I will recall also

615
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,006
the path of

616
00:42:20,108 --> 00:42:25,942
the so called Rome call for artificial

617
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:30,090
intelligence ethics, but in reality is referring

618
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,540
to all the technology.

619
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,200
Several scientists in 2022,

620
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,750
philosopher theologician in

621
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:49,004
bioethics work

622
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:57,880
out progressively identifying

623
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,904
three areas, edicts, education and

624
00:43:01,942 --> 00:43:06,428
right where technology should be in some way monitored,

625
00:43:06,604 --> 00:43:10,364
and six principles, transparency, inclusion,

626
00:43:10,412 --> 00:43:12,540
accountability, impartiality,

627
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,780
reliability, security and privacy.

628
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,220
And in November 2022, they met again altogether

629
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,030
in a workshop called converging on the person

630
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,304
emerging technologies for the common good that

631
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:31,320
is called the Rome Treaty.

632
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,280
There is a clear awareness of the critic

633
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,020
situation of our relationship as human

634
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,604
being with new technologies, and the wording that

635
00:43:46,642 --> 00:43:50,696
the technological form of human experience is becoming

636
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:54,544
more pervasive every day. In the

637
00:43:54,582 --> 00:43:58,268
distinction between natural and artificial,

638
00:43:58,444 --> 00:44:02,044
biological and technological, the criteria

639
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:06,884
by which to discern what is human and

640
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:10,150
technique become more and more difficult.

641
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,064
The question is cultural.

642
00:44:14,192 --> 00:44:18,612
It is necessary to reaffirm

643
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:23,160
the importance of the concept of personal conscience

644
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,170
as our relational experience,

645
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,444
which cannot disregard either

646
00:44:30,562 --> 00:44:34,364
corporality or culture. In other words, in the

647
00:44:34,402 --> 00:44:38,408
network of relationship, both subjective

648
00:44:38,504 --> 00:44:39,550
and community.

649
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,008
Technology cannot replace human contact.

650
00:44:45,174 --> 00:44:48,128
The virtual cannot replace the real,

651
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:51,500
and neither can social media replace

652
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,044
the social sphere should

653
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:58,884
support but not replace. And we are

654
00:44:58,922 --> 00:45:02,950
tempted to make the virtual prevail over the real.

655
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,660
This is an ugly temptation.

656
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:12,810
Also, the pope worked out with

657
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,584
just a sentence that is saying that is

658
00:45:16,622 --> 00:45:21,100
good. The technology continued to overcome eminently

659
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,076
approaches to contribute to the definition of

660
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,752
a new omenism and to encourage mutual

661
00:45:29,816 --> 00:45:33,212
listening and mutual understanding between science,

662
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:34,880
technology and society.

663
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,516
The lack of constructive dialogue between these realities

664
00:45:41,628 --> 00:45:45,430
in fact impoverishes the mutual trust

665
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,860
which is the basis of all human coexistence

666
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,500
and of all forms of social friendships.

667
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,272
So you want to replace the human being

668
00:45:59,326 --> 00:46:02,424
in the middle and not just the

669
00:46:02,462 --> 00:46:06,116
race for technology in the middle. And that is the core

670
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:08,760
of ethics. Like we have said at the beginning,

671
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:17,054
what we can do as organization, it is important that

672
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:20,650
we manage to maintain a common guard between various

673
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:24,674
elements inside the

674
00:46:24,712 --> 00:46:31,266
development of activities. Whatever is the organization and

675
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:35,860
we should in some way support

676
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:42,470
the possibility to

677
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:46,262
prevent problem. So every

678
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:52,780
organization is supposed to think

679
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:57,238
about all the different aspect

680
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:03,210
once they are facing a new development

681
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,922
that imply the use of new technologies. Quantum computing

682
00:47:06,986 --> 00:47:10,430
artificial intelligence, that is the

683
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,142
introduction of somebody, let's call them digital

684
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:22,526
ethics officer that has a large role

685
00:47:22,638 --> 00:47:25,650
because it should cover multiple aspects,

686
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,802
have a deep knowledge and understanding of the company's digital

687
00:47:32,866 --> 00:47:36,690
process, clearly identify exposure and ethical

688
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,950
risk of projects under development organize

689
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,678
and lead the operational governance for the supervision

690
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:48,454
of the human relationship aspect of artificial intelligence

691
00:47:48,502 --> 00:47:51,790
project, including quantum computing utilization.

692
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,270
Because in an organization, whatever it is human

693
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,230
being remains relevant.

694
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,700
Should be the ethical reference for all digital process.

695
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,758
Considering the fact that there are so many evolution

696
00:48:07,934 --> 00:48:10,210
in regulations,

697
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,250
approach sensibility in the society,

698
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,160
have a more strength in the

699
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:24,194
traversality of the reference and people involved in digital

700
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:27,110
project, not just the developers.

701
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,206
There should be a culture of cooperation

702
00:48:31,398 --> 00:48:35,354
and collective decision to obtain coplanning and

703
00:48:35,392 --> 00:48:39,354
transparency within the organization is

704
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:42,782
a role that should make

705
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,202
sensible the organization and advise the different organisations

706
00:48:46,266 --> 00:48:48,750
entities of ethical impacts.

707
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:56,650
Possibly define a strategy ethical strategy

708
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:01,370
develop evaluation and control tools inside

709
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,850
the framework of internal and external

710
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:11,210
rules eliminate or minimize the ethical

711
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:14,986
risk of digital projects integrate and improve

712
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:19,306
the synergy of devices to protect the fundamentals rights

713
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:22,678
of consumer and citizen organize

714
00:49:22,714 --> 00:49:26,542
internal reflection all the above requires

715
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:31,102
that the digital ethics officer

716
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:35,074
have a great human, scientific and practical

717
00:49:35,122 --> 00:49:39,058
qualities to be able to instill the confidence necessary for the activism

718
00:49:39,154 --> 00:49:42,854
guidance. It's just a suggestion that came out in

719
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:47,398
a workshop I attended as well last year in Dublin.

720
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:50,890
And in this

721
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,580
last chart you may see the challenges that is going to face.

722
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:59,566
Can be one person, more than one person, a team can

723
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:03,534
be something that is embedded in the way

724
00:50:03,572 --> 00:50:07,454
to work of the different people independently, that they

725
00:50:07,492 --> 00:50:11,614
are developers or not of technological project. But it should be

726
00:50:11,652 --> 00:50:15,122
something that is embedded in the culture of the

727
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:18,660
organization is working on these kind of things.

728
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,610
As a conclusion,

729
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,666
let's say that we should start preparing today for tomorrow's quantumatics.

730
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:31,414
The different stakeholders should start thinking through the

731
00:50:31,452 --> 00:50:34,830
potential challenges and understand how quantum computing

732
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,660
may create ethical risk in the future.

733
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:42,134
There are existing ethical frameworks for understanding the impact

734
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:46,140
of technology and many of the key considerations are

735
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,430
generic to quantum computing and strategy.

736
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,466
Enterprises should convene internal

737
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:59,606
leaders and experts to determine trigger events.

738
00:50:59,738 --> 00:51:02,942
Such a new technological advancement or action

739
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:06,462
by a competitor that will defines

740
00:51:06,606 --> 00:51:11,086
the need to act or increase investment approaches

741
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:15,110
to ethical risk mitigation should be part of developing

742
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:19,586
a quantum technology strategy. Quantum computing

743
00:51:19,698 --> 00:51:22,466
promises to be extremely powerful.

744
00:51:22,578 --> 00:51:26,890
Now is organization's opportunity to

745
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,534
potentially avoid the kind of ethical

746
00:51:30,662 --> 00:51:34,090
pitfalls that the move

747
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,760
fast and break things

748
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,520
are era left behind.

749
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:47,790
We are at the beginning of a journey. It's exciting,

750
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,270
but with some risk.

751
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,690
It's normal for every trip.

752
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:00,494
So I let you my reference

753
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:04,082
in case you want to contact me to expand

754
00:52:04,146 --> 00:52:06,120
better these kind of things.

755
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:11,014
I share that there are several. I mentioned the one

756
00:52:11,052 --> 00:52:14,954
I'm collaborating with organization non profit that

757
00:52:14,992 --> 00:52:18,474
are sensible on ethics that are working on

758
00:52:18,512 --> 00:52:22,220
these kind of things. In particular, I'm advisor in

759
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:26,250
an historical cultural association in Italy that

760
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:31,774
promote and encourage the study of technology

761
00:52:31,972 --> 00:52:37,978
and ethical development. In the use of that specifically

762
00:52:38,074 --> 00:52:41,774
for artificial intelligence in Italy

763
00:52:41,822 --> 00:52:45,742
and UN and France is active Europea

764
00:52:45,806 --> 00:52:49,390
I'm a member of that is promoting

765
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,770
the use of good artificial intelligence.

766
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,278
I'm also part of a free association of expertise

767
00:52:57,454 --> 00:53:00,530
that supports individuals in skill upgrade.

768
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:06,822
I'm in the area of technology. There is also a branch

769
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:11,420
on crafts and arts that to facilitate people

770
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:15,802
to learn how

771
00:53:15,856 --> 00:53:19,514
the new technologies may help in making

772
00:53:19,632 --> 00:53:25,180
their life better without risking a

773
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,660
bad effect.

774
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:34,274
I thank you all the people that has

775
00:53:34,312 --> 00:53:37,810

are really important for the

779
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:52,720
entire society. Thank you again.
