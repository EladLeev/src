00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,930
Thank you for being here today to talk about a complex topic,

2
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,578
which is kubernetes. My goal is to provide clarity

3
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:38,006
about the principles and the concepts of

4
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:41,814
kubernetes and compare them to the virtualization world that

5
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:45,254
you might be familiar with. So hopefully by the end of this

6
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:48,850
presentation you have a better grasp of kubernetes

7
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,106
and you'll be able to start using it as well. So let's

8
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:55,854
begin. My name is Julia and I'm a global technologist at

9
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:59,614
VIM. And as the name indicates, we started

10
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:04,174
providing services backups mainly for virtual machines.

11
00:01:04,302 --> 00:01:08,242
But nowadays we've expanded and we provide backup for

12
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:12,622
most environments like cloud SAS, including kubernetes

13
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:15,990
as well. But we're not here to talk about that today.

14
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,550
We're here to explain and clarify kubernetes

15
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,698
in an easier way for virtualization

16
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,670
admins. So we traced the evolution of infrastructure

17
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,774
through four significant stages. Initially,

18
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:36,598
applications ran directly on dedicated physical servers,

19
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:40,526
limiting resource utilization and scalability. But with

20
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:43,770
the advent of virtualization, we introduced vms,

21
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,354
enabling multiple virtual instances on a single physical

22
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:50,874
server. Each VM included a complete guest

23
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:55,182
operating system alongside the application, reducing hardware

24
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:59,330
costs and simplifying management. Then with cloud

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,754
computing, we elevated virtualization by

26
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:06,162
offering vms as a service, so facilitating

27
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,842
on demand provisioning and scalability, and removing

28
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:12,930
the burden of physical infrastructure management.

29
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,390
So this was really amazing. But then with the latest

30
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,878
evolution containers we optimized resource usage

31
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:25,558
by sharing the host OS. Kernel containers

32
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:29,222
encapsulate only essential components necessary

33
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:32,974
for running applications, enhancing efficiency and

34
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:37,018
portability across diverse environments. Virtual machines

35
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:41,162
and containers differ in several ways, but the primary

36
00:02:41,226 --> 00:02:44,990
difference is that containers provide a way to virtualize

37
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,242
an OS so that multiple workloads can

38
00:02:48,296 --> 00:02:51,794
run on a single OS instance, whereas with

39
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:55,542
vms the hardware is being virtualized to run

40
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:59,282
multiple OS instances. As organizations

41
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:03,394
seek for future ready infrastructure solutions, the integration

42
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:07,074
of kubernetes and virtualization in hybrid environments

43
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:10,874
will emerge as a compelling strategy. That's why it's so

44
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:14,650
important to understand kubernetes, so we can all start

45
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,214
using kubernetes as well. Similar to how shipping

46
00:03:18,262 --> 00:03:22,718
containers encapsulate goods, software containers similar

47
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:25,802
to how shipping containers encapsulate goods,

48
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:30,602
software containers encapsulate applications and all their dependencies,

49
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:34,370
making them highly portable and consistent across different

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,094
environments. This portability enables developers

51
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:41,810
to build applications once and deploy them anywhere.

52
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,454
Also, just as shipping containers enhance security by

53
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:49,266
sealing goods from external elements,

54
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:53,010
software containers enhance security by isolating

55
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,954
applications from the underlying infrastructure,

56
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:59,734
ensuring that they run consistently and securely regardless

57
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:04,166
of the hosting environment, containers at their core

58
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:08,490
share the host operating system's kernel with other containers.

59
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,238
The shared OS components are red only,

60
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:16,430
resulting in remarkable lightweight properties. This means

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,914
you can deploy multiple containers on a single server

62
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:23,634
or virtual machine, eliminating the need to dedicate an

63
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:27,506
entire server to a single application. This not

64
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:31,518
only optimize resource utilization, but also reduces

65
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:35,018
the overhead of maintaining multiple operating systems.

66
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:38,534
Scaling up becomes effortless, requiring no

67
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:42,930
additional server space. Containerization also addresses

68
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,170
various other challenges in software development and deployment.

69
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,834
It provides a robust solution for mass deployment,

70
00:04:50,962 --> 00:04:55,290
as showncased in the deployment layer at the top of this image

71
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,466
and here we focus on how to efficiently deploy and

72
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:03,070
manage numerous containers beneath. On the

73
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,482
bottom lies the nodes layer,

74
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:09,850
encompassing the hardware and the runtime environment necessary

75
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,378
to execute these tasks. The nodes play a

76
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:16,670
crucial role in supporting containerized applications

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,354
and ensuring they are seamless operation and we'll talk

78
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:24,786
about both the deployment layer and the nodes layer in

79
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:28,662
a little bit. Kubernetes represents nothing short

80
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:31,746
of a revolution in infrastructure management.

81
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:35,874
It has fundamentally reshaped the way we orchestrate,

82
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,414
deploy, and scale applications in today's dynamic

83
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:40,970
it landscape.

84
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,474
Now let's explore the architecture of Kubernetes and

85
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,974
compare its key components to familiar concepts in

86
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:53,534
virtualization. At the heart of Kubernetes is the

87
00:05:53,572 --> 00:05:57,390
Kube API server, which acts as the central control

88
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,194
point. Think of it as similar to the vcentering

89
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:05,054
virtualization. It exposes the Kubernetes API,

90
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:09,566
allowing users to interact with the cluster, the ETCD.

91
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:14,594
It's a database that behind the scene is

92
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:18,694
basically a distributed key value store. So let me go back here

93
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:23,202
and it serves as the Kubernetes memory storing configurations,

94
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:27,206
states and other essential information, and also

95
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:30,774
in virtualization. The vcenter also relies

96
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:34,234
on a database to store configuration data, so we

97
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:37,446
can compare both to the vcenter.

98
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:41,402
Then the Kubernetes, like we said,

99
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:44,738
is API driven, offering both a command

100
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:48,414
line interface and a programmatic API for

101
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:52,502
interaction. This is like how we interact

102
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:56,434
with Vcenter through tools like vsphere client and

103
00:06:56,472 --> 00:07:00,430
ESX cloud. Also in Kubernetes,

104
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,590
pods are fundamental units that host our containers.

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,178
They are like the equivalent of vms in the virtualization

106
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:12,280
world, providing a layer of abstraction for running application.

107
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:17,282
Then, just as virtualization platforms use hypervisor

108
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:20,470
or container runtimes to manage resources,

109
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,614
Kubernetes here employs a container runtime

110
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:28,406
like Docker or containerd to oversee

111
00:07:28,438 --> 00:07:32,398
the execution of containers. And finally, the control

112
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:35,806
plane that we'll explain more in

113
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:39,306
a few slides further encompasses components

114
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:41,962
like Kube, API, server, etcd,

115
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:45,486
etc. To regulate the cluster's behavior.

116
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:49,038
Similar to how virtualization has a control plane

117
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,970
responsible for orchestrating the vms.

118
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,706
Kubernetes, like we said, is the go to container orchestrator

119
00:07:56,818 --> 00:08:00,470
for provisioning, managing, and scaling applications.

120
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,010
Beyond containers, kubernetes also take care of additional

121
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,662
resources like volumes, networks, and secrets.

122
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:12,346
This ensures that your apps have what they need to

123
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,654
connect to databases, interact with firewall

124
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:18,810
backends and safeguard keys.

125
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,958
Kubernetes also operates on a declarative model,

126
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:26,494
so you specify the desire state and

127
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:30,430
Kubernetes takes care of the rest. If you need like

128
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,950
five instances, for instance, you don't need to manually

129
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,714
start them, you just tell kubernetes and it ensures your

130
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:41,602
desired state is maintained. Even if something goes

131
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:45,146
wrong, kubernetes will repair that and maintain

132
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:49,014
that desired state. A Kubernetes cluster is

133
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,182
essentially a collection of nodes where each

134
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:56,230
node can be either a physical machine or a virtual machine.

135
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,154
The cluster thrives on the synergy between a

136
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:03,830
master and worker nodes, where the master node

137
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,102
orchestrate and directs and the worker nodes execute

138
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:12,282
and perform. This collaboration forms the bedrock

139
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:16,270
of modern containerized applications deployment

140
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,298
now talking a little bit more about the worker nodes

141
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:24,942
at the foundation, a node comprises the physical hardware

142
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:29,134
serving as the infrastructure backbone. Then installed

143
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:32,994
on top of the hardware is the operating system, acting as

144
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,534
the base software layer for resource management and application

145
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:40,530
execution, similar to a hypervisor or a host OS

146
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,754
in virtualization. Then to execute containers,

147
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:48,330
a container runtime like docker, container Id,

148
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,942
crio or others is installed.

149
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:56,646
This software is responsible for launching and managing the containers.

150
00:09:56,838 --> 00:10:00,574
The Kubelet service acts as an agency on

151
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:04,234
every node within the cluster. It takes commands

152
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:08,298
from the master controller, and you can also think of Kubelet

153
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:12,250
as a nodes coordinator, which ensures that containers

154
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,220
run as directed. And finally,

155
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,654
the worker node also has a cube proxy,

156
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:25,034
which is another critical components residing on each node.

157
00:10:25,182 --> 00:10:28,642
It plays a pivotal role in proxying connections

158
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:32,360
to the pods from another components known as services.

159
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,122
This is like how a load balancer or network proxy

160
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:40,874
directs traffic to various virtual machines in

161
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:44,154
virtualization setups. Now the

162
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:47,610
master node let's talk about the master node, which is also

163
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,550
called a control plane. Again, this control

164
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,086
plane is responsible for orchestrating and managing the

165
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:58,506
cluster's operation. Within the control plane,

166
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:02,534
the controller manages services. When you submit

167
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:06,814
tasks or requests to Kubernetes, the controller reads

168
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:10,686
them via the API and orchestrates their execution

169
00:11:10,798 --> 00:11:14,530
across the worker nodes. Then there is also another

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,898
components called the scheduler, similar to configuring

171
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:23,282
resource allocation in virtualization, like specifying

172
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:26,610
resources for a new vm in VSphere,

173
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,110
the scheduler that determines where to run containerized

174
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,510
services, which are represented as pods within the cluster,

175
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,590
it selects a suitable worker node for deploying pods,

176
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,154
optimizing resource allocation. Now, in Kubernetes,

177
00:11:44,282 --> 00:11:48,186
pods serve as the lowest form of deployment.

178
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:51,002
They are configured using YAML,

179
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:55,614
following a declarative approach where you specify resources,

180
00:11:55,742 --> 00:11:59,714
container details, and more. Like creating a

181
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,866
vm with power CLI, you define the

182
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:06,790
pod's name, container location, prepackaged services,

183
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,510
and any necessary arguments.

184
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,602
Additionally, you can introduce a persistent devalue

185
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,138
claim known as PVC to request

186
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:19,900
storage for a non ethermoral date.

187
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,462
Kubernetes, being an orchestration layer,

188
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:27,958
manages the storage requirements specified in the PVC,

189
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:31,210
creating what is known as a persistent volume,

190
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,782
or pv. This is reminiscent of

191
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:39,070
managing data stores or NFS exports in virtualization,

192
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,330
with pvcs resembling the VM's data disk.

193
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,342
Now, while pods are the fundamental building blocks,

194
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:51,522
deployments are like the orchestration conductors that

195
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:55,334
simplify the management of these pods. Think of

196
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:59,026
deployments in Kubernetes as orchestration conductors

197
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:02,130
for the pods. They serve as blueprints

198
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,334
defining your application's desired state,

199
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:08,886
including replica counts, container images,

200
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,926
storage secrets, and config maps.

201
00:13:12,118 --> 00:13:15,802
Config maps they store configuration data as key

202
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:19,222
value pairs, allowing containers to customize

203
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:23,302
behavior without altering the image. For instance,

204
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:27,514
environments, variable, and settings can be stored in config

205
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:32,110
maps, simplifying multiple environment setups.

206
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,270
Secrets, on the other hand, securely hold sensitive

207
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,230
information like password or keys.

208
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,822
They enable your application to access vital security related

209
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:47,234
data without exposing it in container image

210
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:50,834
or configurations. So Kubernetes continuously

211
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:54,358
monitors and enforces this desired state,

212
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:58,182
providing seamless updates. So whether you're changing

213
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:01,958
container images or configuration in config maps

214
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:06,086
or managing secrets, kubernetes handles the rollout

215
00:14:06,198 --> 00:14:09,890
while maintaining high availability deployments.

216
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,522
They simplify the application management,

217
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,970
including config maps and secrets, streamlining configuration

218
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,538
changes, and scaling to meet evolving requirements.

219
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:25,310
They are really a powerful tool for orchestrating

220
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,702
containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

221
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:32,226
Now let's talk

222
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:36,006
about stateful sets. The biggest myth in the

223
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:39,126
Kubernetes world, and even in

224
00:14:39,148 --> 00:14:42,482
the virtualization operations infrastructure

225
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:46,946
world, is that Kubernetes is only for stateless applications.

226
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:50,742
Stateful sets empower Kubernetes to orchestrate

227
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,822
stateful workloads and data services with efficiency

228
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:58,646
and reliability. In a typical Kubernetes setup,

229
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:02,862
attaching storage to a pod guarantees data

230
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:06,346
persistency even if the pod is restarted.

231
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,266
However, there is a caveat. The pod's identity

232
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:13,614
remains ephemeral. So after a restart,

233
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:18,430
it might reappear with a different hostname or identifier,

234
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,542
a characteristic that doesn't align with the requirements of stateful

235
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:26,482
applications. But stateful sets ensure

236
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:30,130
that each pod maintains a steadfast and predictable

237
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,970
identity, irrespective of whether it's terminated

238
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,598
or rescheduled. So let's say, for instance,

239
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:41,830
envision a scenario where a stateful set oversees

240
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,038
three database nodes. If one of these nodes undergoes

241
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:49,954
termination, it doesn't reappear as an entirely

242
00:15:50,022 --> 00:15:53,502
new entity. Instead, it will retain its

243
00:15:53,556 --> 00:15:57,610
identity and seamlessly reconnect to the same underlying

244
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,194
storage construct, and will preserve the vital role

245
00:16:01,242 --> 00:16:04,078
within the cluster. So this feature,

246
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:08,606
stateful sets, proves indispensable for stateful applications

247
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:12,930
that require both high availability and data consistency.

248
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,600
Now another important

249
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,614
components with Kubernetes is

250
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:25,122
services. They play a crucial role in managing communication

251
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:29,350
and ensuring the availability of containerized applications.

252
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,742
Imagine another scenario where you have multiple

253
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:36,410
instances of a service running for high availability.

254
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,220
You need an efficient way to communicate with them.

255
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,762
And now think of services as a traffic coordinator

256
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:48,282
within your cluster. When external traffic

257
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:51,902
comes in, you can create an ingress layer which

258
00:16:51,956 --> 00:16:55,506
acts like a load balancer, directing requests to

259
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:59,410
the appropriate destination. Each destination is

260
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,914
represented by a pod, and these pods, they can be

261
00:17:02,952 --> 00:17:06,530
independent and dynamically managed, spun up,

262
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,210
spun down, or updated as needed. So like,

263
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,480
let's say, let's consider a WordPress application.

264
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,658
In a traditional setup, everything might run on a

265
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:21,786
single virtual machine, making it challenging to scale individual

266
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:25,814
components. But with containerization and kubernetes,

267
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:29,530
you can have individual pods for each service,

268
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,134
such as authentication, content and more.

269
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:37,326
This modular approach allows you to scale each service

270
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:41,594
independently. So if your WordPress site experiences

271
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:45,794
a surge in traffic, you can add another service layer, acting as

272
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:49,570
a load balancer to distribute the load efficiently.

273
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,282
Kubernetes services, they simplify the management of

274
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:57,400
communication and scalability in your containerized application.

275
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,862
Now finally, network policies in Kubernetes are

276
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,714
application centric rules that determine how pods

277
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:08,890
can communicate with different network entities.

278
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,586
Essentially, they control the flow of traffic at

279
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:16,854
the IP address or port level, operating at OSI

280
00:18:16,902 --> 00:18:20,146
layers three and four. So by default,

281
00:18:20,278 --> 00:18:24,010
in the absence of specific policies in a namespace,

282
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,454
all inbound and outbound traffic is permitted for

283
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:31,146
pods within that name within that namespace.

284
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:34,418
These policies are a

285
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:38,430
vital tool for fine tuning and securing network communication

286
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,782
within your Kubernetes environment, allowing to define precisely

287
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:46,230
how your pods interact within the network. Now,

288
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,390
just to finish this, let's recap

289
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,458
about how Kubernetes reflects

290
00:18:55,554 --> 00:18:57,560
in the virtualization world.

291
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,130
Kubernetes excels in managing modern cloud

292
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,094
native workloads, offering dynamic scaling and efficient

293
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:09,482
resource virtualization, while virtualization still

294
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:13,034
remains a robust choice for legacy applications.

295
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:17,242
But understanding the right tool for your workload is crucial

296
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:20,970
because as all organizations seek

297
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,514
future ready infrastructure solutions, there will

298
00:19:24,552 --> 00:19:28,734
be an integration between Kubernetes and virtualization in hybrid

299
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:33,678
environments and it will be a very powerful strategy.

300
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:37,490
So this approach bridges the gap between traditional

301
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,258
workloads and cloud native applications.

302
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:43,906
Additionally, I just want to mention that solutions

303
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:47,538
like Kasten by Vim simplified the migration process

304
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:51,354
from virtualization to kubernetes, ensuring a

305
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:55,286
seamless transition and providing data management capabilities

306
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:59,146
for crucial for modern workloads. So if

307
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:02,094
you have more questions and if you're interested about that,

308
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:05,550

IO or reach out to me on social media.

310
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:13,422
I would be glad to answer any questions that you have
