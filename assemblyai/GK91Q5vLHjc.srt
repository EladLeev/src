1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,366

4
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:15,818
adventure. We're empowering new talent worldwide,

5
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:19,802
from Sao Paulo to Egypt and Lagos to Warsaw.

6
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:23,038
Now the future of work is yours to create.

7
00:00:23,204 --> 00:00:27,030
Anytime, anywhere. The world is at your fingertips.

8
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,190
This is Andela,

9
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,658
everyone. It's wonderful to be participating in this conference

10
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:21,906
in 2022. My name is Agnes Muthoni,

11
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:25,718
and I head up partnerships here at Andela. Let me first

12
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:29,146
start off by describing Andela's model and the

13
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:32,890
journey we've embarked on to bring the future

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,422
of work to life. Andela is a global talent

15
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:39,922
marketplace that helps companies build remote

16
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,662
engineering teams faster. We help companies like

17
00:01:43,716 --> 00:01:47,358
GitHub, Goldman Sachs and Cloudfair connect

18
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:50,654
with vetted remote engineers across

19
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:54,174
different markets. This enables our clients to scale

20
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:58,098
their engineering teams quickly and build amazing products.

21
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:01,506
What's important to note is that this has been a

22
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:04,970
journey. The way the world works is changing,

23
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,806
and Andela's vision of the future of work from when we

24
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,466
were founded is now a more obvious reality.

25
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:16,534
We've always seen this global remote workforce and have

26
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:20,182
been working towards it since we launched our very first remote

27
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:23,898
regions in Egypt and Ghana. Now the rest of the world

28
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:27,386
is seeing the impact of Andela for both companies

29
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:31,338
and engineers across the world. At Andela,

30
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:34,542
we believed in this idea of leveling the playing field for

31
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:38,574
clients to hire brilliant and amazing talent regardless of

32
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:42,110
location, and similarly give talent the option

33
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,918
to choose exciting and challenging opportunities

34
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:49,234
with global companies. And the world is now ready

35
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:53,214
for this. And we are seeing more companies embrace this growing global

36
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:57,222
trend and the work Andela has done to bring the future of work

37
00:02:57,276 --> 00:03:00,806
to life. Now, let me talk about

38
00:03:00,908 --> 00:03:04,550
our talent network. When we started

39
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,300
out this mission to connect brilliance with opportunity

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,470
by finding great talent in emerging markets,

41
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,234
then expanding into other regions. Our focus is

42
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:19,766
centered on helping our clients find experienced

43
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:23,450
software engineers who can deliver against our clients

44
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,520
product roadmap. And the way we do this is through

45
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,838
sourcing for talent, screening them,

46
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,998
onboarding the talent onto our talent network,

47
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,902
matching them against specific client requirements,

48
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:43,346
and placing them on partner engagements once they

49
00:03:43,368 --> 00:03:47,586
have met the specific criteria and requirements from the client.

50
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:51,314
Over time, we've built market expertise in bringing

51
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:54,870
great talent through screening and assessments

52
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,462
and screening over hundreds of thousands of applications

53
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,634
using our data driven process.

54
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:07,254
As a result, and through our expansion efforts, we now have engineers

55
00:04:07,382 --> 00:04:10,446
who have joined our network, coming in

56
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:14,122
from more than 90 countries, six continents,

57
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:18,240
with 175,000 technologists in our community

58
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,366
and a successful placement rate of

59
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:26,386
96%. Now if you're listening to

60
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:29,486
me and you are a software engineer,

61
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:33,906
you may have a question. And one of the questions that you may have is

62
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:37,942
why join Andela? Well, let me tell you why.

63
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:42,182
We've spent time clearly listening and understanding our

64
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:46,038
clients'needs and working hard to meet

65
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:49,810
those needs. Our advantage as a talent network

66
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,794
are the long term opportunities available,

67
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,602
the global talent community where engineers can

68
00:04:56,656 --> 00:05:00,066
connect with other brilliant engineers across the globe.

69
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:02,394
We also offer career coaching,

70
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:05,470
educational advancement and flexibility.

71
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,546
Remote first is changing the way we work and opening

72
00:05:09,578 --> 00:05:12,854
up opportunities for developers in emerging markets

73
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,502
to enter the global talent marketplace.

74
00:05:15,646 --> 00:05:19,106
This phenomena of being able to work from anywhere has become a

75
00:05:19,128 --> 00:05:23,490
more obvious reality that has been cultivated

76
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,600
forward over the last couple of years.

77
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,694
In our recent developer report, what we did find is that

78
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:34,502
more thats 80% of developing are

79
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:38,418
keen and are excited about the idea of wanting to

80
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:41,980
work remote. Now let me share a couple of benefits.

81
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,438
So the first benefit is it gives more people more flexibility

82
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:50,162
with where they choose to work and live, thus enabling

83
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:54,222
developers to have more work life harmony. The second

84
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:58,874
benefit as a software engineer or experienced

85
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:02,786
talent, you get to connect with global opportunities and

86
00:06:02,808 --> 00:06:06,770
it opens up borderless opportunities, creating new and exciting

87
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,554
opportunities on the global stage. In a most

88
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:15,558
recent survey, what we did find is that 74%

89
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:19,938
of all Andela engineers had a quality of life improvement.

90
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:23,622
65% of them said that they're better able

91
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:27,794
to save and 81% cited

92
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:31,046
with longer than one year of tenure did cite an increase

93
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:35,174
in take home pay. Diversity and inclusion was cited

94
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:39,062
as a key priority by many corporate leaders

95
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:42,446
and through our expansion plans we help companies

96
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:46,974
build and grow more diverse. Thats as

97
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:51,002
we continue to advance our mission forward of connects

98
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:55,026
brilliance with opportunity the Andela Learning community has

99
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,242
been able to support thousands of engineers go

100
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:02,430
through learning journeys that help them grow in their careers.

101
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,402
The learning community offers access to in demand

102
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:10,118
technology courses through education partners like Google,

103
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:13,878
Microsoft, Facebook and Salesforce, as well as

104
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:18,002
it connects engineers with job boards

105
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:21,286
and opportunities for them to be

106
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:23,350
able to grow in their career.

107
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,814
As a company, we have been working towards the future of

108
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:31,406
work and now I'm just excited that the world is ready for

109
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:32,380
it. Thank you.
