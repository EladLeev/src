00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,326
Hello everybody. So I couldnt talk

2
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,846
about incidents forever. In fact, I do talk

3
00:00:47,868 --> 00:00:51,566
about incidents always, but for a while it

4
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:55,902
felt like nobody was listening. Years ago, when I started working

5
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,406
on incidents and talking about incidents always, we were

6
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:03,210
doing really great work with incident retrospectives. We were learning super duper interesting

7
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,622
stuff, but those learnings and communication

8
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,286
never really went anywhere. We then realized

9
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:14,066
that in order for these recommendations to actually happen, we needed others to

10
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:17,986
see why we were pushing for them. The engineers themselves couldn't

11
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:21,814
push for these changes because they couldn't succinctly explain what they were

12
00:01:21,852 --> 00:01:25,686
requesting. Instead, they would point to some incident reports that were full

13
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,954
of screenshots of errors in timestamp timelines that didn't specifically

14
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:33,358
explain what was needed. And the noneengineering

15
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:36,954
folks couldnt really understand why these incidents were impacting them.

16
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:40,602
After all, we were still making money. And that's when we started

17
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:44,294
focusing on not only learning from our incidents, but telling

18
00:01:44,342 --> 00:01:47,994
others about them. We realized that the reports that we were creating

19
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,518
weren't telling the whole story, so we redid the way that we would write them

20
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:55,134
so they could be more complete representations of how we experienced the

21
00:01:55,172 --> 00:01:59,266
incidents. These long reports, though, were kind of tough for folks to

22
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,770
read. So we started adding abstracts and summaries as onramps,

23
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,226
and then we added weekly updates so folks could quickly ingest what

24
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:09,462
was happening and start realizing that incidents were applying every

25
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:13,000
day and they were having a huge impact on how we do our work.

26
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,046
And then we started synthesizing some of that information so we could

27
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,294
go to product owners and decision makers and make a case for our long term

28
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:23,898
recommendations. And then something magical happened.

29
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:27,834
Folks started listening, and they engaged with what we were

30
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:31,538
talking about. And not going to lie, this didn't happen immediately,

31
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:35,134
but little by little, our recommendations were making

32
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:39,034
it into the quarterly plans, and they were making it into the team cultures

33
00:02:39,082 --> 00:02:42,586
and the process changes. And not all incidents

34
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:45,778
went away. We were still doing some really cool engineering stuff,

35
00:02:45,944 --> 00:02:49,566
but we were out of that cycle of infinite incidents that were continuing

36
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,330
to happen over and over again. We started having the bandwidth to

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,126
tackle different problems, and that was great. And we were

38
00:02:57,148 --> 00:03:01,094
able to do that because we were able to share

39
00:03:01,132 --> 00:03:05,346
the incident findings. So hi everyone. Vanessa Huerta

40
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:08,642
Granda I work in solutions at Jelly IO.

41
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,382
I've been working in technology for the past decade,

42
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:14,934
focusing on incident response and learning from incidents. And I truly,

43
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:19,222
truly, truly believe that learning from incidents is the key that can help software

44
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,666
organizations improve how we do our work. And I want to

45
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:26,206
help in making all of this work more attainable and sustainable to the

46
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:30,026
everyday engineering. So today I want to talk to you all about sharing

47
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:34,000
incident findings effectively and what we can gain from doing that.

48
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,238
So what do you do after a postmortem?

49
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:42,574
So you've worked really hard after your incident. You had a collaborative postmortem,

50
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,194
you listened to several different points of views, and you've come up with some really

51
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:49,990
rich learnings and recommendations. What do you do then?

52
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,686
What do you do after your post mortem? Some of

53
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:56,886
us will probably write a report. I've done this usually in

54
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:00,374
Jira. Some folks like to use Google Docs. You can write

55
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:04,074
up your action items. You can tag the folks that sometimes is part of that

56
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:07,466
report. More Jira tickets, really great stuff.

57
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:11,066
Maybe you had the review meeting over Zoom. So you share that recording and

58
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:15,646
you hope that people listen to that 1 hour session or

59
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:18,894
you close up the ticket now that the incident is over and folks can access

60
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:22,366
it whenever they want to. Maybe you're just done.

61
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:25,838
This incident was a lot. You're tired, you just want to move forward.

62
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:29,874
You have work to do and there's really going to be another incident tomorrow anyway.

63
00:04:29,912 --> 00:04:31,540
So you move on with your life.

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,546
So while we all do different things after the postmortem, do we know

65
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,006
if others are interacting with our learnings, or are the

66
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:43,766
learnings mostly living and dying in Google Drive bright have

67
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:47,266
sometimes been I've worked very, very hard on some incident reports

68
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:50,906
that have very, very complete information, but nobody ever ends them.

69
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:54,534
And it's frustrating, especially when our organizations

70
00:04:54,582 --> 00:04:58,650
are the ones that are mandating. We spend time creating these postmortem documents,

71
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,598
and so if we're mandated to complete some sort of incidents report

72
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:07,354
or a five Weiss template, it must mean that organizations

73
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:10,000
believe that sharing incident findings is important.

74
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,280
But why do they think that? Why do we think that?

75
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,002
When we really think about it, teams appreciate the culture of keeping everyone

76
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:21,634
in the loop. People like transparency. Last year,

77
00:05:21,672 --> 00:05:25,054
Jelly released a guide on how to learn from incidents. We call it the Howie

78
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:28,070
Guide. You can actually find it on our website at jelly IO.

79
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,394
And when discussing sharing incidents findings, the Howie guide explains

80
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:37,570
that your work should not be completed to be filed. It should be completed

81
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,306
so it can be read and shared across the business.

82
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:43,526
Even after the learning review was taken place and the corrective

83
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:47,066
actions have been taken, we work hard at arriving to

84
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:50,374
our learnings to uncover themes and takeaways. How often are

85
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:54,270
reports written to be filed rather than to be read and shared?

86
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,360
Why else do we share information?

87
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,294
Well, we also share just for learning sake and

88
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:04,654
sharing timely information is also sort of marketing for the kind of work

89
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:08,130
that we do, right? Sharing that information is a marketing piece of

90
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,580
the learning from incidents programs that we lead.

91
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,878
Findings may also impact others in the organization. Some outcomes

92
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:18,146
or insights may impact these person or a team or the way we do our

93
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,990
work. And letting them know of these learnings is a part of a just culture.

94
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,006
We also do it as a TLDR for the decision makers. Maybe we

95
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:28,962
need buy in for next steps from leadership or other stakeholders.

96
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:32,826
Actually, we usually do. And these folks are probably not going

97
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:36,186
to be very likely to attend every single review meeting, especially if you have

98
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:40,026
a lot of incidents. And finally, you also have folks who

99
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:43,566
didn't attend the review meeting. Maybe they were out that day on PTO. Maybe they

100
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:48,078
needed some ends down to work on other stuff. Maybe they

101
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:50,880
were working through another incident itself.

102
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,240
So there are many, many other reasons for learning.

103
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,514
And all of that is to say that sharing incidents findings can help get our

104
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:02,146
point across to a wider audience. So if we've worked hard on

105
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:05,506
uncovering our learnings, but others aren't seeing it, what's the

106
00:07:05,528 --> 00:07:08,402
point? I've often heard engineers discuss,

107
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:12,246
sadly, how they're stuck in this cycle of incidents, that they

108
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:15,046
believe that there's things that they can do about it, but they're not in a

109
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,722
position of power to get those things done. But sharing incident

110
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:22,570
findings is a way out of that cycle of incidents.

111
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,522
You may say, vanessa, I'm already sharing my report. It's in the drive.

112
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:30,394
Anyone can access it. And that's true. But my

113
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:34,186
inbox is not at zero. And I bet a bunch of other people's inbox isn't

114
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:37,502
at zero either. And I can tell you that having

115
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,320
something available to me doesn't mean that I'm going to read it.

116
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,750
So how do we get folks to read it? So let's think about movies.

117
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,882
The way that we learn about and the way that we learn from movies are

118
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,654
different. You can watch a 120 minutes movie,

119
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:55,762
but maybe then you want to hear people talk about it for 45 minutes,

120
00:07:55,816 --> 00:08:00,130
or you want to listen to a ten episode podcast about this movie.

121
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,086
Or maybe you want to share a review with someone that they can read in

122
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,806
five minutes and decide if they want to go to the movies with you or

123
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:10,166
not. Or maybe you just want to tweet some spoilers, right? Like Spoiler

124
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,206
Arent and the movie Titanic, the boat sinks.

125
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:17,334
Sorry for that spoiler, y'all. The truth is that different audiences

126
00:08:17,382 --> 00:08:20,874
need to learn different things from what you're sharing and

127
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:24,474
who are these different audiences? Going back to the movie

128
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:27,886
analogy, you can have your huge fans. They're the ones who are going

129
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:30,778
to listen to that like ten episode podcast,

130
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:34,446
your casual viewer, the ones who want to read that review before they commit to

131
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:37,874
spending $12 on the movie ticket and these another $12

132
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:41,742
on the popcorn. You have your studio executive, your Oscar voter.

133
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:45,626
They're hopefully watching those 120 minutes forms movies.

134
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:49,174
The film industry is catering to different types of audiences differently, just like

135
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:52,854
we will when it comes to incidents. So going

136
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:56,694
back to incidents who arent

137
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:00,134
the different audiences. So you have your engineers, you have the people

138
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,866
that you invited to the review meeting but couldn't make it. Maybe some

139
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:07,734
people who are impacted by the outcomes or the insights from the analysis,

140
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:11,180
or just people who want to learn more about what your team does.

141
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,582
You have your managers. These can provide necessary context to others.

142
00:09:15,636 --> 00:09:19,374
They can say, this is why my team does this. This way you have your

143
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:23,006
execs, your leadership who can approve of suggested changes. You have

144
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:27,006
stakeholders who can both be technical or not technical. The way that you share

145
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:30,482
the information with them will be different. And then you have your outside

146
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:34,098
parties, right? You have your customer support, the folks who are like answering the

147
00:09:34,104 --> 00:09:37,406
folks when something is going wrong. You have your public relations folks,

148
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:40,120
the folks who are writing the tweets when your site is down.

149
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,526
So within these different audiences, folks can have different purposes for wanting or

150
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,910
needing to see the learnings from an incident.

151
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,762
And the purpose can be many, right? Sometimes when I share

152
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:56,506
something, I'm requesting an action, right? I'm saying, hey Jen, please make this

153
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:59,706
change or add it to your to do's. Sometimes they just need

154
00:09:59,728 --> 00:10:02,874
to know, hey Jen, I'm making this change. This is how it's going to impact

155
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:06,186
you. Sometimes you're just updating them, right? Like hey Jen's

156
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:09,520
boss, remember the incidents from the other day? This is what happened.

157
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,006
But sometimes you want to change folks'minds, you want to say,

158
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:16,526
hey, Jen's boss, please don't fire Jen. This wasn't her fault.

159
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:18,580
Read this report, you'll find out why.

160
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,378
With all of this in mind, let's take a look at the different formats in

161
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:26,734
which you can share the information. So these are some of the formats

162
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:29,894
that I like to use. I've iterated through them throughout the years.

163
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:33,586
We'll go into more detail in a bit. But we have the report, these abstract,

164
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:36,610
the summary recording, weekly updates and presentation.

165
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,406
A lot of what we've built here at jelly was done with this in mind.

166
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:43,606
We want to make it easy for people to share their learnings.

167
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:46,250
So you'll see how we do that in the next few slides.

168
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,826
First, let's start with the report. Right? That is probably the

169
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:54,254
format that you're most used to, but this is different

170
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:58,238
from your standard postmortem. This one is focused on

171
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,506
telling the bigger story of what happened and the context around how the events

172
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:06,686
came to be. The goal with the report is always to learn from the incident.

173
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:10,206
As you can see here what I'm including in my report, I'm including

174
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:13,806
a narrative timeline, a visual narrative timeline, because we're

175
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:17,282
telling what happened with the incident from different points of views.

176
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:21,382
We're not just saying start, middle, end, we're going

177
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:24,742
back and forth trying to understand what people were experiencing at the different

178
00:11:24,796 --> 00:11:28,726
parts of the incident. The report is

179
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:31,946
great for asynchronous communication. Again, it should

180
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:35,718
be written to be read and collaborated with, not just to be filed.

181
00:11:35,814 --> 00:11:39,146
So when I'm writing a report, I really like to encourage folks to

182
00:11:39,168 --> 00:11:43,066
make comments on it, to link out to it, to include it in their prs

183
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:46,942
and how they do their work. The reports arent the most

184
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:50,030
in depth written artifact that's coming out of your incident.

185
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,202
A report will give folks an in depth understanding of the these around the incident

186
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:57,886
and how we find them. They'll mostly be read by folks that are involved

187
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:01,806
in the incidents or teams using similar technologists, or folks those

188
00:12:01,838 --> 00:12:05,010
buying you need for possible action items,

189
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,186
but they are long, right? These are the most in depth artifact

190
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:12,646
that's coming out of the incident. So reading a report is probably going

191
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:15,922
to require quite a time investment from your reading,

192
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,222
from your reader. So in order to catch people's attention,

193
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:23,082
you probably need something else. And here is

194
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:27,094
where the abstract comes in. And the abstract is my personal favorite

195
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:29,370
way to share about incidents.

196
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,946
It is your incidents elevator pitch. So it's one to two paragraphs on

197
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:37,434
what happened, why we should care about this event, any contributing factors or themes,

198
00:12:37,482 --> 00:12:41,134
et cetera. These abstract is meant to help folks decide if they

199
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:44,858
want to commit to learning more about the incident and reading that

200
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:48,274
full report. You can share it with anyone. I personally love

201
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:51,070
sharing it with executives and leadership.

202
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,338
Here is these report. It's a jelly screenshot. We're calling it

203
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:57,766
the executive summary, but as you can see, it tells you when

204
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:01,800
the incident started, how long it lasted, who was involved, what the impact was,

205
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,754
and next up is the summary. And the summary gives more

206
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:11,546
context. It's a slightly more comprehensive version of the

207
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:15,354
incident. You can include action items, include who

208
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:18,906
suggested them, and here

209
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:22,426
you can see we included key takeaways as well. So we usually share this

210
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:26,006
with people who can be impacted by the learnings and anyone whose buy

211
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,086
in you need. And when I'm sharing a summary, what I like to do is

212
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,846
I like to tag people and explain to them why

213
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:36,162
I'm sending this to them so I can share the summary and say,

214
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:39,518
add Jen sharing this so you can see that we're

215
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:42,834
making this change. And then Jen can go in and

216
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:46,514
find out more information. The next format is to share

217
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:49,734
a recording and that's just exactly what it sounds like. It's a recording of the

218
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:53,682
actual review call. And when sharing it, it's really helpful

219
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:57,446
actually to include a message with timestamps of when key moments were

220
00:13:57,468 --> 00:14:01,258
being discussed. So I can share my recording and say

221
00:14:01,344 --> 00:14:04,634
at minute ten we discuss the impact. At minute 15 we

222
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:08,442
discuss this these at minute 25 we discuss

223
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:12,106
action items. And this is

224
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:15,498
the most similar format to attending the review meeting.

225
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:19,102
But there are some drawbacks. Number one, it takes a while

226
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:22,494
to get through it, right? If it's a 1 hour meeting, it's a 1 hour

227
00:14:22,532 --> 00:14:26,494
recording. And number two, viewers or listeners can collaborate with

228
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,154
it. When you're in a meeting, you can raise your hand, you can say,

229
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:32,674
hey, this is how I experienced it. You can't do that if you're just watching

230
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:36,674
these recording. But this is a great format to share with those who

231
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:39,510
were involved in the incident but couldn't attend the meeting.

232
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,094
If I'm being completely honest, leadership or other colleagues who were not

233
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,550
involved in the incident are probably not going to watch or listen to

234
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,614
this type of review. That's okay. They are not the audience

235
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:54,730
for this format. That is fine. And then

236
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,050
you get the idea of a weekly update.

237
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,526
And the weekly update consists of a quick review of all the incidents

238
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:04,814
that were analyzed that week. It can be a list of all incidents with their

239
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:08,766
abstracts and a link to the full report for more information. You can

240
00:15:08,788 --> 00:15:12,334
also include additional data points like teams impacted for a

241
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:16,170
quick access to additional learnings. It's a

242
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,918
great, great option for larger organizations that have lots and lots

243
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:23,202
of incidents. Everyone can take a quick glance to the list,

244
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,866
find the incidents that they're interested in based on keywords like services impacted

245
00:15:26,898 --> 00:15:30,098
or technologies involved and these read further whatever they're

246
00:15:30,114 --> 00:15:33,858
interested in. I personally had some really great luck

247
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:37,862
with this. I used to send weekly updates to everybody in

248
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:41,158
technology. All the managers could just skim. If I'm a

249
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:45,114
manager and I'm working with technology a I could see, okay, these technologies were

250
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:48,266
part of incidents let's see how this could impact me. Let's see what

251
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:51,630
I need to learn from this. Let's see what I should share with my engineers.

252
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,926
So if you've been paying attention so far,

253
00:15:57,028 --> 00:16:00,302
all of the formats that I've discussed arent forms,

254
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:03,614
individual incidents. And now we're moving on

255
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:07,086
to when you're looking at a universe of incidents.

256
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,022
So there's a difference between the insights that we share from one incident versus

257
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:15,330
multiple incidents, the micro versus the macro insights.

258
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,606
When it comes to incidents, I'm a fan of focusing on learning

259
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:23,506
rather than having a post mortem that then becomes an action steps

260
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:27,046
factory. And when I say an action items factory, I mean the post mortems that

261
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,814
we've all been at, right? Like we just sit there, we're not here to learn,

262
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:32,666
we're just here to say like, oh, let's change this bug, let's change that,

263
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:36,026
let's change that, let's change that. Half of those tickets are never going

264
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:40,322
to be completed. We're not going anywhere. Those are the kinds of post mortems

265
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:43,040
that lose faith in the process.

266
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,490
But when you have more incidents and you have more learnings,

267
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,026
you can start proposing changes, because odds

268
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:55,326
are if you have these sample size of one, you're not going to be able

269
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,914
to make a large structural change because of it, right? If I have

270
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,986
one incident, I'm not going to be able to say like hey,

271
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,666
we should do a reorg based on this, but if I have more

272
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:09,506
incidents then I can start suggesting things as

273
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,302
an analyst. When you start spotting macro trends, you can't and you should

274
00:17:13,356 --> 00:17:16,920
make a cause for them. That's how you change your lives for the better.

275
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,494
The difference between this and an action item factory

276
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:25,306
is that you're giving yourself and other folks the time to truly understand the

277
00:17:25,328 --> 00:17:28,554
learnings. You're reflecting on your work over a span of

278
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:32,346
time and you're making decisions together. To give

279
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:35,726
you an example, in the past I worked at an organization where

280
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:38,814
we had a very centralized incident response system,

281
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:42,270
meaning we only trusted a few people to start an incident.

282
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,922
That's because we believe that only a few people

283
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:49,198
had the understanding of our systems to make things decision.

284
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:53,106
As we grew, as we DevOps more things, we realized that

285
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:56,494
this process was actually delaying us and learning about high impact

286
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:59,910
incidents. And we started asking ourselves,

287
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,094
what can go wrong if we change this? What can go wrong if we change

288
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:06,326
this process? We had several discussions and

289
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:09,866
we were like, let's give this a try. But this was a change that

290
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,674
was outside of our control and

291
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:16,922
when we have a change that's outside of our control, I like to focus

292
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:20,458
on presentations. So from time to time, you will

293
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:22,730
get the chance to present to a wider audience,

294
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,942
especially when you're trying to make recommendations. When I'm doing this,

295
00:18:26,996 --> 00:18:30,366
I usually like to walk folks through the timeline of can incident so

296
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:33,954
they understand what they're dealing with. A lot of the time, the people

297
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:37,742
who are attended these presentations are not living incidents

298
00:18:37,806 --> 00:18:40,850
every day. They're not like me, who can talk about incidents forever.

299
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,226
So I like to walk them through the incident. I like to show them

300
00:18:46,248 --> 00:18:49,814
that visual timeline. I present, any data that I have,

301
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:53,286
any themes that I have that I want to discuss, and these I go into

302
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:56,840
my recommendations, and I always, always target things to my audience. Right.

303
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,174
If I'm targeting this to a very technical audience, I include very technical

304
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,726
details. If I'm targeting this to a business audience, I include

305
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:08,426
business details. Okay, but how

306
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,700
do I get them to agree to my changes?

307
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,646
When you're proposing changes that are outside of your control,

308
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:19,182
I usually suggest that folks think of this workflow and ask

309
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,782
these questions and answer them to whoever you're proposing the changes

310
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:26,386
to. So let's think back of the example. These I want

311
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:29,730
to change the incident process from only a few people

312
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,490
being able to call incidents versus everyone gets to race an incident.

313
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,038
What is the suggestion in this case? It was a suggestion to change the

314
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:41,398
way we run incidents. Who needs to approve it?

315
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:45,446
This was a process that everyone in tech, in the tech.org knew,

316
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:49,046
so some engineering leadership probably needed to approve of it. Going up

317
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:53,002
to the CTO, actually. What do they need to see? They need to see

318
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:56,714
that we have done our due diligence. What are we basing this

319
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:59,926
information off of? We're basing

320
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,758
it off of a good number of incidents where the

321
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:07,098
incident process was not like the root cause, it wasn't

322
00:20:07,114 --> 00:20:11,470
the thing that caused the incident, but it was a contributing factor.

323
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,418
And then these incidents led to a number of discussions, and responders agreed

324
00:20:15,434 --> 00:20:18,754
that this was worth pursuing. We can see all of this information because we have

325
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,860
very thorough incident reports that we can look back to.

326
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,826
What could go wrong? Well, if we communicate this wrong, it could

327
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,710
cause more confusion. But we're already thinking ahead,

328
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,374
right? In this case, the responders that are suggesting this change,

329
00:20:32,492 --> 00:20:36,006
we're suggesting that we try it out for a quarter and then we revisit our

330
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:39,320
progress. What is our end game?

331
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,674
Maybe having more control over the process. We wanted to see what would happen

332
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:46,826
if we open up the floodgates. And who

333
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:49,994
is doing all this work. This example is easy because I own

334
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:52,460
the process, so I'm the one that's making it happen.

335
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,446
But it also had to be part of my quarterly planning. I had to have

336
00:20:56,468 --> 00:21:00,110
my manager approve that I would be spending time working on the change

337
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,650
management process. Guess what?

338
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,922
It worked. And many other recommendations also

339
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,060
worked, and some didn't. That's fine. That's how the world works.

340
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,180
And you can also make it work for yourself.

341
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,586
Because we had done our work throughout all of the individual incidents,

342
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:23,320
we were able to uncover what was happening at a macro level.

343
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,910
Cause we had done our work, we could then confidently answer

344
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,610
all those questions in the last slide and make a case for the changes

345
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,202
that we were suggesting. And so next

346
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:39,638
time that you feel like you're stuck when it comes to learning from incidents,

347
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:43,806
next time when you feel like you're in a cycle of repeating, repeating incidents where

348
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:47,518
you feel like you know the answer but you're not getting anywhere, remember that

349
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:51,370
these process doesn't end in the post mortem. Sharing incidents

350
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,582
learning is indeed a pivotal step in turning your incidents into

351
00:21:55,636 --> 00:21:58,734
opportunities. Thank you very much.

00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:02,266
