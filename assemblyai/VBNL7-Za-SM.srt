00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,262
Hi everybody, welcome to this conference. Today we start talking about

2
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:46,038
for something DevOps association about

3
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:50,040
for Gita and also another scopes around for DevOps side.

4
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,586
So we start talking about for unlocking

5
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:57,774
agile efficiently DevOps speedup with

6
00:00:57,812 --> 00:01:01,434
kit. This is me. This is me. Jonathan,

7
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:05,006
Jill or Johnny Punk. I'm a DevOps and si re engineer at

8
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:08,274
Lawan. You can follow me on Twitter or

9
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:11,982

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,398
Three one or in YouTube. You can find my videos at Johnnypunk

12
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,654
too. Let me share with you this

13
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:27,062
little quote. Life is really simple but wins is

14
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:30,474
making complicated by confusions that

15
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:34,326
it's true because you start this journey for DevOps

16
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:38,060
site for a complicated stuff. But when you grow

17
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,522
in DevOps you start to generate

18
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:46,526
more complicated stuff but more easily. So go

19
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:50,090
ahead. That is our table of continuous

20
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,130
today we talking about for agile something

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,294
related with DevOps, common concepts

22
00:01:57,342 --> 00:02:01,646
here related for ETLC and also bcs

23
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:05,674
and how we can use bcs and DevOps.

24
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:09,110
And we have prepared for you this a little demo

25
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,026
for you. So start with DevOps

26
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:17,706
and Agile. What is exactly agile for

27
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,898
define Agile? We need to take a look for this part

28
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:25,574
for the beginning side. The beginning side are related

29
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:29,062
for waterfall, right. When we start with waterfall

30
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:32,314
we define how to waterfall works and how

31
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,470
to generate this on a big scope,

32
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,680
big requirements for the companies.

33
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,530
So when these companies define these big requirements,

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,154
we have also a big times. With these big

35
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:48,926
times we have a little customer feedback

36
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:52,434
and we generate a bigger releases for every

37
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:56,818
new feature that you can try to deliver for the teams

38
00:02:56,834 --> 00:03:01,510
and also for the companies. And you have these

39
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,430
four independent teams. So you have for one side

40
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,286
the development teams, for another side the QA

41
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,210
teams and also for another side the business

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,642
teams. And also these teams have not

43
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:21,600
well communication and they generate a lot of

44
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,738
friction for the communication and the communication riskily.

45
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,910
When you start talking based it on Waterfall.

46
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,738
Another part we have the

47
00:03:34,824 --> 00:03:38,466
new age that is related for agile. When we

48
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:42,114
talk for agile we need to define exactly how to

49
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:45,494
data active works mode for the

50
00:03:45,532 --> 00:03:49,206
companies is established because

51
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:53,170
you generate in a lesser scope the new features

52
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,614
and also you can address the

53
00:03:56,652 --> 00:04:00,842
new efforts for the same path and the same goal. But you

54
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:04,522
split better these goals. And how do you

55
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:08,470
and your team also generate these efforts?

56
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,742
So you generate the granular requirements. You have

57
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:16,154
small teams, you have fast customer feedback.

58
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:20,154
That is pretty awesome because that reduces actually this friction

59
00:04:20,282 --> 00:04:23,890
on the development and QA and business side and

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,202
you generate small and quick releases, right?

61
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,306
Because we have small times, we have

62
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:34,546
more granularity for the requirements and also you generate this

63
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:38,534
in a more easily way. So you enable for

64
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:42,342
that exactly the part that we need to talk about

65
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:45,810
the agile side, that is the team's collaboration.

66
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,260
Because you start with agile for enable that.

67
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,006
So what is the agile manifesto score

68
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:57,690
values? We need to define exactly this

69
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,646
because the manifesto mentions to us that individuals and

70
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,390
integrating over process and tools, right. For another

71
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,146
one, customers collaboration over contract negotiation,

72
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:13,374
working software over comprehensive documentation and

73
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,674
responding to chains over following a plan.

74
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:20,286
That is the core values for this agile

75
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:23,826
manifesto. And also we need to address our four

76
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:27,566
for the customers and also for the developments

77
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:31,446
and UAE and business teams need to

78
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:34,966
address that. So let's continue with

79
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:38,230
another when we move for

80
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,542
DevOps, we base on agile,

81
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:45,180
right? Because we need exactly the company

82
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,794
are currently bulk in this culture site.

83
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:52,346
Because if the company doesn't have this culture,

84
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:56,174
it's very hard to implement DevOps because we need

85
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:59,934
to reduce this friction. But if the friction could

86
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:04,082
become from the orifice site, it's very hard to start to

87
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:07,602
do this implementation for the companies we

88
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:11,550
comes to support exactly the interactive, the granular

89
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,386
requirements, the small times, the fast customer feedback,

90
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:18,834
the most unquit releases and the collaboration,

91
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:22,966
et cetera related for this. But we need exactly the

92
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:27,030
agile are currently implemented on the company or if

93
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,762
the implementation for DevOps will be in a

94
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:34,554
wrong way. So based on DevOps we

95
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:37,702
define exactly these features

96
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,990
or these core values for DevOps, that is columns

97
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,830
for one side the culture that comes from the agile,

98
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,426
another side that related for automation.

99
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:53,550
And also how do we can use the automation tools

100
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,540
and also the scripts for doing something for the

101
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,194
SDLC and also how do we can lean and

102
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:06,134
we reduce exactly the perspective for the customers and

103
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:09,510
how do we can impact in a bigger way

104
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,738
this new feature for the company's

105
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:18,726
values. So for another part we need to share,

106
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:22,362
because when we generate this new culture, we need to share

107
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:26,266
exactly how to the culture will be involved with that.

108
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:29,846
And also we need to measure, because if we don't have

109
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:33,694
this measure, we don't have this new

110
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:37,662
picture for the impact that we currently generated for the

111
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:40,240
company and also how to impact the process.

112
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,170
Let's move on to the second

113
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,650
part that is related for the CDLC and also the BCs.

114
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,842
These are the biggest core values that we have

115
00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:57,590
currently, because we define here

116
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,922
exactly how to the software development lifecycle recurrently

117
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:06,070
is and how do we can comes to LDIs

118
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,314
and move around from one site to another

119
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:14,010
and start this software development lifecycle right. For one

120
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,310
side we need to define exactly these requirements analysis

121
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,206
that every company needs to start and

122
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:26,430
the second part are related for design. How do these

123
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,302
requirements will be adapt or could be addressed. This new

124
00:08:30,356 --> 00:08:34,658
effort for the company that is part of the development team

125
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:38,386
and also the Q 18 and the business intelligent team and how to

126
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:41,380
address this new platform,

127
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,054
the notary side related for the implementation but not exactly

128
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:49,720
just how to the development team

129
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,626
create new feature for the company and these new core values

130
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:59,114
that you need. So that it's very

131
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:03,466
important that you have in mind because if you doesn't you

132
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:06,860
need to redefine exactly what the process is.

133
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,534
And also you have another part that is related for the testing,

134
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:14,238
right? Because we need to test exactly in every part of

135
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:17,710
the software development lifecycle, the new feature that we

136
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,320
will to deliver in every time.

137
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,122
So let's move on for the second term that is

138
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:28,994
BCS. And also you can know this

139
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:32,686
term like a version control system. And this version

140
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:36,326
control system help to us exactly how to

141
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:40,482
base it on the software development lifecycle will be defined

142
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:44,470
these functionalities or

143
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,314
using the code side, right. That it's not exactly for the

144
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:52,442
development side for the development team. Sorry. Because when

145
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:56,170
you drop all your values

146
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,498
for the code, you also enable

147
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:05,722
infrastructure as code. You also enable automation

148
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:08,846
as code and security as code and a

149
00:10:08,868 --> 00:10:12,074
lot of new valuables

150
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:15,186
for as code integration that currently you

151
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,466
have for your team, right? Then you need

152
00:10:18,488 --> 00:10:21,934
to take this online because it doesn't

153
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:26,482
just occupy for development site, you impact

154
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:27,560
more than this.

155
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,346
So based on that we move for the next topic

156
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:36,178
that is related for the BCs and DevOps,

157
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:39,462
right? When we start cyclic talk for

158
00:10:39,516 --> 00:10:43,254
DevOps site we have here three biggest

159
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:46,874
part. One that is related for development, another for

160
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,538
operation and also the customers will be a little history

161
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:54,826
here related for the wall of confusion

162
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:59,054
and this wall of confusion how to the development part?

163
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:02,674
Take this bomb that is

164
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:06,222
called code and send to Operation

165
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:10,194
team. That is the first part that we need to cover here

166
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:14,046
because that is exactly how to DevOps

167
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:18,214
start this new change for culture. But exactly how

168
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:21,574
do you change the culture and move a lot

169
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:25,638
of things for ascode definition, right? That is

170
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:30,202
exactly that. We need to take a look for that. Because as

171
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:34,540
here we saw the development guy but

172
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,906
this could be the QA or could be the security

173
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:42,662
side or could be the infrastructure or could be a networking side.

174
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:46,906
So we need to take this more in a Huk scope

175
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:51,150
and also address the new Sephora for how

176
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,642
we can operate that using the bcs for

177
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:59,394
the company with

178
00:11:59,432 --> 00:12:02,914
that in mind we enable this collaboration between teams, right?

179
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:06,306
We exactly start the points for the CI

180
00:12:06,338 --> 00:12:10,146
and CD part. When we talk exactly for the CI

181
00:12:10,258 --> 00:12:13,560
is how we can get this code,

182
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,466
any code for example for Java or Python

183
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:22,442
or node. How do we can

184
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:26,730
integrate this for our company values.

185
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,840
For example we take could be a Java application

186
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,142
and we get this code and we download from our

187
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:39,534
version control system. With that we

188
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:42,802
need to generate an artifact for and

189
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:46,898
also when we compile and test and

190
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:50,610
generate this artifact at this we

191
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,002
define exactly the end of the CI, the integrating

192
00:12:55,086 --> 00:12:58,950
for this part, right. That we call it continuous integrating.

193
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,314
We move very quick to the deployment

194
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:06,694
side. When we start talking about for the

195
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:10,266
deployment we exactly take a

196
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:14,540
look for how the application will be deployed on

197
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:19,238
if this application deployed on kubernetes

198
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:23,182
or could be on Docker or could be in

199
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:26,830
virtual machine. I don't know, depends exactly what

200
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,278
the software needs will be deployed on

201
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,838
because that depends exactly for the architectural partner

202
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:38,206
the architecture software takes for generate

203
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:42,126
this. But at this moment you generate

204
00:13:42,318 --> 00:13:46,342
your artifact and also

205
00:13:46,396 --> 00:13:50,690
you will deploy that artifact on the cloud provider

206
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,150
or could be on prime. That is the focus

207
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,686
that we need to define here. With that in mind we

208
00:13:57,708 --> 00:14:01,266
enable a couple of tools behind of could be Jenkins,

209
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:05,606
could be Gillab, CI, GitHub actions Azure,

210
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,826
DevOps, a lot of tools behind of that is an

211
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,846
orchestrates movements and tools that you can

212
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:16,286
enable for. But at the end of the day you

213
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:20,074
need to take this look for the CI and CD

214
00:14:20,122 --> 00:14:23,714
part, right? We need to talk about in

215
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:27,330
deep about this because when we talk

216
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,914
about for these new challenges we need exactly

217
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:34,274
mood for the culture and

218
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:38,530
what is the concepts around for the current components

219
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,134
that we need to take a look. So we move very

220
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,942
quick to the demo site. This is a little

221
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:49,766
disclaimer, please don't execute this on production because it

222
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:53,254
is a stable code. But you need to

223
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,046
define will be another consideration for

224
00:14:57,068 --> 00:15:00,640
execute that on your your

225
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:06,078
production environment. So we can move very quick

226
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:09,546
here for this code. And also I currently deploy

227
00:15:09,578 --> 00:15:13,214
on you need first or

228
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:17,002
could be you have enable this new consideration

229
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:21,298
for we will deploy this code

230
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:25,666
on GitHub, right? This is as part of GitHub

231
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:30,738
configuration. Also we use here GitHub

232
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:34,374
API and also we built a lot of

233
00:15:34,412 --> 00:15:38,082
code behind us for using these APIs

234
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,914
and how do we can get advantage from these APIs and

235
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:46,074
how do we enable new features for our

236
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,578
companies and also for teams. Because at the end of the day

237
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:53,886
the objectives for us like at DevOps engineers are related for

238
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:58,074
hey, how do we can enable more easily for the teams,

239
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:02,046
right? And with that we return very quick here for

240
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:05,714
the slides and also we talk

241
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,442
about for this consideration about

242
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:13,458
the culture that we talk about for DevOps site

243
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:17,126
because our part for the one site for the DevOps that

244
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:20,614
we define it for. So for that of

245
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:24,950
mine we start here and also I generate

246
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,694
a lot of configuration that I drop here related

247
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:33,034
for the readme file. Let me share

248
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:36,794
with you this drop here and

249
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:40,198
this is pretty as unfortunate. So you need to

250
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:44,394
create here in your GitHub organization

251
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:48,382
you create a new free organization and also in my case I

252
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:51,774
call it Conf 42 2024

253
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:55,490
DevOps Johnny Pong belongs to personal and

254
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,770
skip up members for this. When you create

255
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,226
this organization you need to enable the tokens for this

256
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:05,906
organization and you need to generate

257
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:09,798
this configuration like a manual site because

258
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:13,938
this is a very specific configuration

259
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,282
that you need to take once a time

260
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,826
and you don't need to execute anytime when you

261
00:17:20,848 --> 00:17:24,474
create that organization. So with that

262
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:28,646
in mind you can follow these steps

263
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:32,126
and also you can move for the next one. The next one

264
00:17:32,148 --> 00:17:35,630
are related for how do you create your personal access

265
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,406
token? How to this access token will

266
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:42,706
be defined for for one site for the

267
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,862
repository permissions, another site for the organization permission.

268
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:50,366
If everything going good you copy

269
00:17:50,398 --> 00:17:54,018
and paste like this little export that

270
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:57,254
you have here. And also when you

271
00:17:57,292 --> 00:18:00,854
have here this export you can play with

272
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:05,160
the APIs behind of 1

273
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,250
bar for how you can test that are related for this cure

274
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,194
comments here. And also if you copy and paste this

275
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,778
on your terminal you saw something

276
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,494
different from 401. That is

277
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:26,334
an auto site return value for

278
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:30,206
the codes from HTTP. And also if return

279
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:33,234
exactly at this moment here.

280
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:36,942
This is a little gque JSOn

281
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:41,586
file and

282
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:45,300
also we can drop here in a pretty nice

283
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,186
output here. And also if you see that it's

284
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:52,870
because you can see and the token works properly

285
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,680
and you saw here more

286
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,074
full command that you can use for this exactly

287
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:06,410
how you can interact with the API for the GitHub site.

288
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,790
But it's the same yeah you have here the reference

289
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,646
for and that's it. So that

290
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:18,366
is the first part the configuration site.

291
00:19:18,468 --> 00:19:21,806
Then we need move very quick for

292
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,138
this file that is called tool version and currently

293
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:28,562
use hdf tooling for

294
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:31,490
manage my environments on the folder side.

295
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,686
And also these define exactly what kind of version I'm currently

296
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:39,606
working on every part of this repository you need to

297
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,322
install Python in this version and terraform,

298
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:45,798
Pulumi and Opentofu. And also if you

299
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,786
will generate these configurations like

300
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:53,514
continuous documentation, you can install terraform docs and

301
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:59,334
also execute commons comments

302
00:19:59,382 --> 00:20:03,434
for generate auto documentation for the terraform and

303
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:06,538
Opentofu implementation.

304
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:09,966
So that is pretty similar to this.

305
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:14,114
Let me share with you when

306
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:17,780
you saw the auto documentation for terraform that is

307
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,380
something reference like this.

308
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,274
The name, the providers, the modules,

309
00:20:25,342 --> 00:20:29,314
their resources and the inputs

310
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:33,254
and the output generated for the different modules that you currently work

311
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:36,646
and develop for the company,

312
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:40,842
right? That is pretty awesome guide because

313
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:44,314
when you start for that you define exactly how

314
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:48,106
to the company generate or start the journey for

315
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:52,294
the continuous documentation. But let's

316
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:56,126
move very quick for a start for one site that is related for

317
00:20:56,148 --> 00:20:59,422
Opentofu. For that part

318
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:03,690
we have here the main that is for terraform implementation.

319
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,958
Also we have the provider here that is for gap

320
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:12,146
at this moment in the version 50

321
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:15,814
and also we move here for the variables and we

322
00:21:15,852 --> 00:21:19,814
saw here exactly the conf 42 2024

323
00:21:19,852 --> 00:21:24,118
DevOps and I wrote another

324
00:21:24,204 --> 00:21:28,282
command for rewrite these variables but it's just

325
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:32,458
because you need to exactly drop here what is your

326
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,362
current organization that you generated for and

327
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,262
also what is the current user that you generated for

328
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:44,430
interact with these APIs.

329
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,390
That's the first collaboration. So let's move

330
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,454
very quick for this readme on the terraforms, the opentofu

331
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:57,182
sorry for this and also we enable tofu.

332
00:21:57,246 --> 00:22:01,310
So we need to move exactly for tofu site for Opentofu

333
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,850
folder and we can initialize

334
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:10,006
this repository or this configuration that

335
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,622
we generated for very quick because

336
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:17,898
at the end of the day you generate this for I

337
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:22,826
don't know what happened here. Let's present

338
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,278
this command because it's not normally

339
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:29,882
that is the normally output for. So we

340
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:34,286
have saw here exactly the collaboration, the initial collaboration for

341
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:38,026
and also we generate here the first template

342
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:41,600
repository. So if we move very quick for the

343
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,686
configuration for my organization

344
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,626
site GitHub.com is it

345
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:53,940
related for comfort to

346
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:59,266
Unipunk? And we have here our organization,

347
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,014
right? We saw here exactly the settings the

348
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:06,502
people surround for this organization. What is the current

349
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,946
teams or repositories or project or something like

350
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:14,010
that. So when we send this comment

351
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,138
we generated exactly the new

352
00:23:18,304 --> 00:23:22,160
repository on this

353
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,734
organization. So we need to

354
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,558
create exactly the field repository that are related for

355
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:33,490
the template repository, this template,

356
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,602
define it for the new repositories based

357
00:23:37,656 --> 00:23:41,362
on this organization. You could be defined this for

358
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:45,182
the current teams or

359
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:49,414
hey, we need to define what is the template repository for

360
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:53,362
Java or template repository for docker or for terraform

361
00:23:53,426 --> 00:23:57,266
or something like that, right? Then we can enable

362
00:23:57,378 --> 00:24:00,780
and create this field repository here.

363
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,006
And also little move for js fear

364
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,700
repository not found here.

365
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,338
Yes, fears or repository

366
00:24:17,514 --> 00:24:22,000
are not found. It sends this

367
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:27,038
general for this collaboration tofu

368
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:27,780
apply.

369
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,698
And also if we send this tofu apply we show

370
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:37,762
here exactly that will we create seven new objects

371
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:42,566
on GitHub that is related one for the

372
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:46,562
field repository, the second one are related for the main branch,

373
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:49,894
define it for this repository and

374
00:24:49,932 --> 00:24:53,190
what is the current branch for this repository.

375
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,400
And also we create here the development team

376
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,538
and we enable the repositories

377
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,142
for this team. What is the access for this team

378
00:25:06,196 --> 00:25:10,238
for these new repositories that could be you generated for

379
00:25:10,404 --> 00:25:14,274
and you adhere exactly a new members for

380
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,778
this team exactly at this moment at this

381
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:21,890
scenario related for just me and

382
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,974
you define exactly the branch protection that is I

383
00:25:26,012 --> 00:25:29,602
think the most important here because when you enable the branch

384
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:33,158
protection for your

385
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:37,574
repositories you exactly start with one

386
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:41,434
definition for your teams that is related for what is the

387
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:44,938
key strategy that you will be covered on.

388
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:48,906
Because when you define this strategy on your code,

389
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:52,742
you define exactly what kind of rules this repository

390
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:56,942
will be defined for. So that is pretty important because

391
00:25:56,996 --> 00:26:00,158
at the end of the day you need to cover exactly

392
00:26:00,244 --> 00:26:03,690
how to the teams are enabled this feature

393
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,422
and how to these teams are focused on

394
00:26:07,556 --> 00:26:11,534
and how to these teams are exactly send and generate

395
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:14,754
this. So let me check here exactly what

396
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:18,694
happened with the execution because it is not normally that

397
00:26:18,812 --> 00:26:22,870
it will be wrong. You have our field repository.

398
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,360
Okay, I know what happened here,

399
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,210
let me move because in variables I need to move and

400
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,700
rewrite here.

401
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,994
That is Johnny Pong and also my

402
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:45,230
user is Jaden 20 right sense

403
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:54,320
again. And like

404
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:57,652
you see the time

405
00:26:57,706 --> 00:27:02,692
that take this new execution take

406
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:06,310
more time. So the execution are currently well

407
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,552
so we can wait a couple of minutes here and just

408
00:27:10,606 --> 00:27:14,772
refresh here. And you saw exactly the new repository,

409
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:18,136
the templates and the teams if

410
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:21,880
you move for the team side you create and see here exactly

411
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,884
the element our team and this team I

412
00:27:25,922 --> 00:27:29,548
was added for that and also for this team

413
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:32,896
currently have one repository and this repository you

414
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:36,304
can drop in and if you saw here

415
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:40,656
exactly for this repository in the settings side you

416
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:44,784
saw on branch side the configuration that

417
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:48,672
we define it on. So that it's pretty awesome because

418
00:27:48,806 --> 00:27:52,532
you exactly define these rules at the end of the day very

419
00:27:52,586 --> 00:27:55,860
quick and just take a couple of minutes

420
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,820
to deploy that on GitHub,

421
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,980
right. I generate the same code for terraform

422
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,184
and also for Pulumi. But let me

423
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:09,784
check with Pulumi because when you enable this

424
00:28:09,902 --> 00:28:13,784
using these IAC tools are very nice.

425
00:28:13,982 --> 00:28:17,932
The benefits for each tool when

426
00:28:17,986 --> 00:28:22,830
you deploy them so we can send here to

427
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,284
destroy and

428
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:32,140
these rebirth changes that we generated on GitHub

429
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,530
site. Yes,

430
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,620
and move very quick to Pulumi.

431
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:45,188
And if you know Pulumi or

432
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:48,660
Kulpetan you have the capabilities

433
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,424
here more than IIC tools because I

434
00:28:52,462 --> 00:28:56,280
wrote this configuration on using

435
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,428
the Python languages.

436
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:02,764
Let me move for Pulumi and if

437
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:06,092
we currently want to follow

438
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:09,964
these steps you can copy and paste here. But the most

439
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:13,900
important here is this install. If you clone this repository

440
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,864
install that are currently take information from your

441
00:29:18,902 --> 00:29:22,704
token and download the dependencies and start this communication from

442
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:26,704
the API side so we can activate

443
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:30,324
that and send the Pulumi GitHub I currently done

444
00:29:30,362 --> 00:29:33,764
that and also the Pulumi install

445
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:37,876
doing in the same way you could skip this, that is related

446
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:41,976
for how you can update the requirement files and

447
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:48,308
you can send here the same attribute

448
00:29:48,404 --> 00:29:51,724
like a tariff, right. You can generate this

449
00:29:51,842 --> 00:29:55,436
associate for the target or could be you generate in a

450
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:59,244
general way. So if we saw and we

451
00:29:59,282 --> 00:30:03,092
send here this, they will be generate

452
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:07,970
nine elements on this

453
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,776
implementation for the infrastructure side.

454
00:30:11,958 --> 00:30:16,628
So they are currently generate four here.

455
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:20,884
Could be the wrong parameters for the tree internally on

456
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:24,864
polyme will be wrong because I execute

457
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:28,730
in a wrong way. But you can follow these

458
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,616
steps and you can generate this in a good way.

459
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,032
So if we refresh here move

460
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:42,044
very quick again for

461
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:46,540
our organization we saw exactly the same implementation.

462
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,428
So that is the power behind because you

463
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:54,156
enable the same capabilities

464
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:57,776
using a lot of IAC tools and also

465
00:30:57,878 --> 00:31:01,696
you can define what is better for you and

466
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:04,876
your team. What is the capacity for your team exactly.

467
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:08,980
You need to take a look for that. Let me

468
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:14,660
don't forget destroy here destroy

469
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,744
IPn s dev that is

470
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:24,344
related for the stack and I

471
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,760
confirm that will be delete all. So we

472
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,412
return here for our presentation and

473
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:35,390
this part of the end of the demo site.

474
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,196
Let me share with you a little brief for

475
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:44,992
this summary that we know for today. So we

476
00:31:45,046 --> 00:31:48,304
talk in a big scope about

477
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:51,424
the agile, about DevOps, about what

478
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:55,176
is bcs and CDLC

479
00:31:55,308 --> 00:31:58,704
and what kind of features we can enable

480
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,516
using exactly the IAC concepts behind of

481
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:06,004
the DevOps and how to base it on these tools. We can

482
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:09,880
support exactly this part of the culture. That is the biggest

483
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,152
challenge here because it's not easy when you know

484
00:32:14,206 --> 00:32:17,992
exactly how to the company works, but you don't know how

485
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:21,210
to implement these tools for.

486
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,532
And another is the same if you know a lot of

487
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:30,220
the technical implementation for tools

488
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
that it's good. But if you don't know exactly how to

489
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:38,624
your organization generate this or could

490
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:42,172
be your organization. Generate a process for something related

491
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:45,524
for the sofa durm lifecycle or new feature or something

492
00:32:45,642 --> 00:32:48,912
related for it's very complicated.

493
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:52,784
Try to generate these new features

494
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:56,436
based around the companies that you currently define it

495
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:59,704
for. So you need to generate this balance for that

496
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:03,544
site. That is the DevOps we have these

497
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:07,016
new jobs or could be. These roles are very important currently

498
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:11,752
on the companies right? So that

499
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:16,004
for today. Thank you for joining to this session. I appreciate

500
