1
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,186
So hello all. Good morning, good evening and good afternoon in wherever time zone

2
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:27,586
you are. So, my name is Archit Srivastava and today I'll

3
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,666
be taking you through my talk. And the topic of the talk is in ignotis.

4
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,322
And the talk is basically an introduction about how quantum computers

5
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:40,406
can be helpful in the fields of astrophysics. And the meaning

6
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:44,006
of the word in ignotis is into the unknown.

7
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:47,866
So it is actually an area which is very unknown to

8
00:00:47,888 --> 00:00:51,126
us, like how can quantum computers

9
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:55,178
be used utilized in the area of astrophysics?

10
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:59,066
So let us move forward with the topic. So, a basic

11
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:03,054
introduction about me. So who I am, where I work, and what all

12
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:06,882
things I have done in the past. So I am

13
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,966
one of the founders of a quantum hardware community called as Akim.

14
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:13,886
And at AKM we basically try to spread

15
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:17,414
awareness about what the quantum hardware architecture is.

16
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:21,234
And we basically research about different quantum hardware

17
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:24,018
architectures like photonics, iron trap,

18
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:27,554
superconducting. And we basically dive deep into

19
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:30,982
how these different quantum architectures

20
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:34,678
work especially. I graduated with a bachelor's

21
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,946
of engineering degree in electronics and instrumentation engineering from

22
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,454
RV College of Engineering, Bangalore. And me,

23
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:45,546
along with one of my colleagues, we started off a quantum research club,

24
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:49,840
and its name was circuit. So circuit is an abbreviation for

25
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,726
center for interdisciplinary research in quantum information and

26
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:57,554
technology. And over there, we had different verticals which focus more

27
00:01:57,592 --> 00:02:01,362
on different areas of quantum computing, to be specific, like quantum machine learning,

28
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,242
quantum optimization, quantum algorithms and all.

29
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:08,294
And I got associated in my final years of

30
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,066
college with a community called as quantum Computing India.

31
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:15,718
And over there, along with a few of

32
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:19,674
my colleagues, we started off the quantum hardware learning circle, where we focused more

33
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:23,114
about the growth and what all things

34
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:27,098
are going on in the quantum hardware domains. And in

35
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:30,886
my final years of college, also, I was one of the first quantum computing

36
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:35,418
interns at the Boon QSI Private Limited, which is one of the leading

37
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:39,194
quantum computing firms in the computing fluid dynamics

38
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,398
area. And the vision, the mission, the aim that they have and they

39
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:46,066
are trying to achieve is fabulous, and they are

40
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:49,426
doing great in this field right now. And the research that they

41
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:52,942
do at their firm is one of the best in the industry,

42
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,446
which is basically collaborating the research field,

43
00:02:56,568 --> 00:02:59,270
research domain and the industry together.

44
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,742
And the problem statements that they're tackling is

45
00:03:02,876 --> 00:03:06,674
going to help the humanity

46
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:10,026
and the industry and the research area in general in the

47
00:03:10,048 --> 00:03:14,410
coming future. Currently, I work as full stack data engineer

48
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,182
at Hewlett Beckert Enterprise in the Silicon Valley of India,

49
00:03:18,246 --> 00:03:22,474
Bangalore, in the state of Karnataka. And my

50
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:26,810
day two day work basically deals with anywhere from developing

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,222
dashboards and performing data analytics work,

52
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:34,574
to developing machine learning models and trying to predict

53
00:03:34,702 --> 00:03:38,002
some certain trends, and parallel developing data

54
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:42,370
engineering pipelines so that to perform specific ETL tasks.

55
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,866
My personal interest lies in the area of the

56
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:50,194
field where we can integrate quantum computing with the field of gravitational

57
00:03:50,242 --> 00:03:53,586
wave astronomy. So these two are very vast fields,

58
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:57,254
and a lot of scientists in these past have tried to integrate these two

59
00:03:57,292 --> 00:04:00,554
fields together to basically get to a one

60
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:04,810
unison field so that we can explore

61
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,294
what the limits of physics are and how we can break

62
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:12,990
them so that we can explore the unknown.

63
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,790
Hence the title of the topic. So, moving forward with the topic,

64
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,030
basically. So, the motivation behind this talk was basically

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,886
to reduce the lack of knowledge that

66
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:29,698
is there, that is out there with the quantum ecosystem in general and the need

67
00:04:29,784 --> 00:04:33,186
for the growth in the domain. Like, we get to hear that if

68
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:36,840
we combine quantum with artificial intelligence or even

69
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,214
general artificial intelligence, we basically can

70
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:46,166
develop certain systems which will take over humanity, and a lot

71
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:49,674
of stuff and misinformation going around. And my

72
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:53,194
personal opinion is we are years behind this

73
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:57,066
particular years behind actually getting to

74
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,810
leverage the actual advantages what a quantum computer

75
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,862
can provide to us, and then coming

76
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,478
more to specifics of the topics. So there is can increase in the need

77
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:12,538
to spread awareness about the various topics related to quantum computing

78
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:16,306
and astrophysics. So in the industry currently, we get to see a lot of

79
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,566
use cases of quantum computing being placed in the fields

80
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:23,134
of, say, finance, supply chain optimization, or various

81
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:26,806
fields like pharma, getting to

82
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,658
know about the protein folding examples, and various places

83
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:33,926
quantum computers are being used currently. But there is

84
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:37,618
a very niche area where quantum computers can become a

85
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:41,930
big asset, is the area of astrophysics and gravitational wave astronomy,

86
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,882
where, if the research is done in the right

87
00:05:45,936 --> 00:05:49,690
way, with the correct motivation, then I personally believe

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,834
that we can develop certain tools,

89
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:57,950
certain experiments, or certain methods which can experimentally verify

90
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,634
certain theories of physics, like the quantum gravity, or even

91
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:06,034
the theory of everything. That is sort

92
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:09,394
of a hypothesis that people are yet

93
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:12,706
to prove and yet to achieve. So, moving on

94
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:16,386
with the topic, what we have in the

95
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:20,306
topic today is. So if I give you a brief about what the contents

96
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,554
will be. So, basically, I'll be giving a brief introduction

97
00:06:23,602 --> 00:06:27,330
about what the whole talk will be about. Then we'll

98
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,566
dive a bit deep in what quantum computers

99
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,926
are, and I'm sure that my fellow

100
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:37,574
colleagues, in different talks have talked about quantum

101
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:41,118
a lot. So in the third segment of the talk, I'll be focusing a

102
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:44,942
bit more on where quantum computers can work

103
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:48,026
and what this term ligo

104
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:51,486
or Ligo means and why astrophysics at

105
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:55,534
all? And the methods in which quantum computing

106
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,454
can be included in astrophysics.

107
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,978
And what are the final conclusions with the talk that we has today?

108
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:07,186
Moving on with the topic, so, basically giving a brief introduction

109
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,240
about the talk today. So,

110
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,766
quantum computing and astrophysics. So, astrophysics is

111
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:17,254
basically the science which deals with the

112
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:21,254
mathematics related two celestial bodies and everything related

113
00:07:21,302 --> 00:07:24,780
to them. Even the mathematical analysis of,

114
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,902
say, black holes or even relativity

115
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,446
or it is a very vast area, and it is

116
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:35,854
basically on a scale. If we try to look,

117
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:39,214
it is at a totally right hand

118
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:42,426
side. And if we look at quantum computing or quantum physics

119
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:46,114
in general, the quantum physics lies on the extreme left. So these

120
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:49,714
two fields are basically at the extremes of these

121
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:53,790
physics that we have today. And what scientists

122
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:58,934
believe that if we are able

123
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:03,106
to combine and unify these two extreme fields, then we'll

124
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:06,546
be able to get to explore

125
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:10,714
the unknown that is out there in the field of science and

126
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:14,538
explain a lot of unknown phenomenon that happen

127
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,900
in nature. Currently,

128
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,240
we have heard about a lot of developments in past

129
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,542
while going through the noble price

130
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:30,094
distributions that happen. So we might have heard about the

131
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:33,762
terms lIgo, or gravitational wave detectors, and along with

132
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:37,522
quantum computers. So these are different

133
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:41,154
terms that have been floating around from the past couple

134
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:45,140
of years. And these are very

135
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,554
complex and complicated devices to perform totally

136
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:54,920
different and very difficult tasks. Like LIgo are

137
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,018
very big detectors out there, which basically

138
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:02,566
help us to detect the gravitational waves that Einstein predicted

139
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:06,780
in his theories. And quantum computers are basically

140
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,002
an ensemble of various equipments, chips and

141
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:15,134
cutting edge technology, engineering science, physics to

142
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:18,542
basically leverage out the advantages being

143
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:22,518
provided by quantum physics to perform quantum operations

144
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:26,530
and give us the advantages that it can provide

145
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,574
to us, so that we can use them for daily use cases

146
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:34,254
like predictions

147
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:38,002
in the area of quantum machine learning and encryption,

148
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:41,320
which is a very niche area in quantum computing right now.

149
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,366
There are different architectures of quantum computers also. And what

150
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:49,830
is quantum gravity? So, quantum gravity is a hypothetical theory that scientists

151
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,514
have developed, which basically is at

152
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:57,430
the intersection of quantum physics and astrophysics,

153
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,680
or specifically gravity. So they try to

154
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,778
predict that there can be the existence of a particle

155
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:11,374
for gravity and called as graviton. And if

156
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:15,250
that exists, then it basically will complete the theory

157
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,380
and combine the two vast theories of

158
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,210
general and special relativity along with quantum computing.

159
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,550
So, basically, there is a need to investigate the realm of the unknown,

160
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,214
hence the topic of the talk. And it is a very

161
00:10:32,252 --> 00:10:35,634
niche area of research, which has infinite

162
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:38,140
possibilities. So,

163
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,114
moving on with the topic, these talk so giving

164
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:45,818
a brief introduction of what the quantum is.

165
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:49,500
So this is a quantum computer.

166
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,038
Well, actually not, because this is a part of quantum computer.

167
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:56,366
And right beside, right at the below,

168
00:10:56,468 --> 00:11:01,120
we have the chip. And this actually is a picture which

169
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,434
shows us the inside of what a quantum computer looks like inside the.

170
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:11,406
So basically, this is called as the golden chandelier, because majority

171
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:15,206
of the components are created out of gold. And right

172
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:18,786
there below sits

173
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:22,322
the quantum child, and the temperature

174
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:26,230
decreases as we move down the

175
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,478
chandelier, and below it is nearly

176
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:33,366
absolute zero. So this is a part of quantum

177
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:36,682
computer, and there will be a lot of casings out of it,

178
00:11:36,736 --> 00:11:41,266
and it will be connected to various various

179
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:45,434
control system equipments, and then to the output and input signaling devices,

180
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:48,606
the measurement devices and all. So when

181
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:52,494
I say, well, it is not actually a quantum computer because

182
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:56,354
there are a lot of devices attached to it

183
00:11:56,472 --> 00:12:00,674
which is not there right there in the picture. So all

184
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:04,606
those components, the measurement components, the input components, the output components,

185
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:08,098
along with the cloud systems, the software, the hardware

186
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,746
and different architectures, they comprise of what we collectively

187
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:15,686
call as a single word or a quantum computer. So this device is

188
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:19,740
able to perform and leverage all the advantages being provided by

189
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,250
quantum physics. And it provides the

190
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,006
output so that we can use, a normal user

191
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,454
can use the advantages of

192
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,710
quantum physics like superposition,

193
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,162
superposition and all, and sitting

194
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:42,926
remotely via a cloud. So companies like IBM,

195
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,734
Google, Microsoft, Amazon, along with several

196
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:49,938
other companies, they are providing the access

197
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:53,874
to these quantum computers via cloud, via cloud services,

198
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:57,638
and via different sdks that they have, via different libraries that

199
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,870
they have created, like Kiskit, Penny Lane,

200
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,920
Bracket, et cetera. So a lot of

201
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,934
buzz and hype is going on around quantum computing and the industry.

202
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:13,062
And there are companies which are sort of investigating

203
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:16,938
and diving deep into this niche technology

204
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:18,940
and leveraging it,

205
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,082
the complete advantage of it, for their own development.

206
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:27,194
Like in the area of finance, Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered

207
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:31,454
and other companies are using quantum computers to basically work

208
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:35,310
on problem statements like portfolio optimization, stock price prediction,

209
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,094
et cetera. In the area of supply

210
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:43,374
chain, companies like ExxonMobil, et cetera.

211
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:46,962
Are working on optimizing the shipment

212
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:51,126
paths being provided for

213
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:54,386
the ships, for shipments, to optimize the overall supply

214
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,346
chain paths or routes that they have, so that there is a

215
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:01,914
cost cutting advantage. And there are other

216
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:06,138
firms working in different areas like

217
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:10,350
battery optimization, so that we can develop

218
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,274
more batteries, which are optimized.

219
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:17,214
And a lot of research is going on in and around industry with the

220
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:20,880
sdks and the

221
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,954
libraries that these companies are providing. So has

222
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,140
we talk there is constant development going on

223
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,606
around the quantum computers and the structure that we

224
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:39,480
have in front of us is being constantly updated, upgraded and

225
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,398
improved, so that the companies

226
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:47,346
that the problem statements that they are targeting, they can be

227
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:51,206
more optimized, more viable

228
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:54,682
to the customers and the end users. So,

229
00:14:54,736 --> 00:14:58,278
as I was talking about various quantum computers,

230
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:01,774
so various quantum computers are out

231
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:05,486
there. And different companies work on different kind

232
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:08,382
of architectures also.

233
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:11,626
So we have superconducting trap diamonds,

234
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:15,602
photonics, and there are a lot of diamond centers and

235
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:19,330
a lot more architectures out there, like the

236
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,718
anilos available, being made available by D Wave.

237
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:26,898
So, all in all, a lot of quantum computers

238
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:31,142
are being developed with various kinds of architectures. And different

239
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:35,320
kinds of architectures are optimized for different kinds of.

240
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,710
To work on different kinds of problem statements.

241
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,178
And like the annealous that are being used, they are

242
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,098
more specifically optimized for the optimization problems.

243
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:52,842
And thus they are being used in supply chain optimization, portfolio optimization

244
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:57,470
problems by the companies in various domains.

245
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,678
So this, along with the

246
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:05,886
information being provided in the other talks at the conference

247
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,710
by my colleagues, will basically give you a generic

248
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,374
and overall picture of how the quantum realm

249
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:17,062
is currently and what the scenario of quantum computing is.

250
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:20,390
So now, moving on to the focus part of the talk

251
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,670
is basically the astrophysics part, and my personal favorite.

252
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,138
So, talking ABout astrophysics. So, basically,

253
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:31,754
specifically talking will

254
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:35,174
be the gravitational waves. So, gravitational waves

255
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:38,934
are basically ripples in the spacetime fabric,

256
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:42,826
which was predicted by Einstein's general theory

257
00:16:42,858 --> 00:16:46,426
of relativity. And the pictures

258
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:50,186
that you are seeing here are different observatories built across the globe.

259
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:53,906
And the first Two to come up Were in

260
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:57,250
LIVINgStON AnD HaNford. And these are long

261
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,762
tubes, long vacuum chambers, long vacuum tubes which

262
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:05,300
carry lasers. And they basically

263
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,266
are like, if I give a number to the length

264
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,394
of these arms that you see over here, so they are 4 length.

265
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,802
And if someone asks, why 4 length?

266
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:20,502
So it is because if

267
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:24,054
the arm lengths are more than 4, curvature of earth

268
00:17:24,102 --> 00:17:27,978
comes into picture and the arms BasicallY starts to bend around the

269
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:31,274
curvature of curves. So it is difficult to keep the laser

270
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:35,582
straight BeyoND 4

271
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:39,610
overcome Those kind of disadvantages.

272
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,870
Scientists are currently working on different projects.

273
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,942
Two basically reduce

274
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:54,626
the arm length disadvantage. So they

275
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:58,374
are setting up satellites and coming

276
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,382
up with projects in space,

277
00:18:01,516 --> 00:18:05,426
basically. So that like one, two name is LISA. So LISA

278
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,954
is being developed to basically have the

279
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:13,126
arm length problem solved. And the observatory

280
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,362
will be set up in space using satellites. And you have

281
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:20,006
various observatories in and around the world. So KAgRA

282
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,002
is one of the observatories in JApaN. It is underground,

283
00:18:23,146 --> 00:18:27,466
and underground observatories have different advantages and disadvantages.

284
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:31,598
And we have Virgo in Europe. We have geo 600 in

285
00:18:31,764 --> 00:18:36,018
Germany. So 600 is, this specific observatory is

286
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:39,906
sort of an experimental observatory. The arm lengths over here for

287
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:43,826
the detectors is only 600 meters. And the

288
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:47,026
one coming up right now in India, in the state of Maharashtra,

289
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:50,834
is the Indigo project that recently the government of India

290
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:54,434
has signed up for, and the budgets have been released.

291
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:58,258
So these are the overall pictures of how the

292
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:01,114
detectors or the gravitational wave detectors look like.

293
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:04,634
So, now moving forward with the talk, so how

294
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:08,646
these detectors work, actually. So the lasers

295
00:19:08,678 --> 00:19:12,526
that I was talking about. So there is a source of laser light. And if

296
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:16,458
I play the video again. So the video basically says that there's

297
00:19:16,474 --> 00:19:19,534
a beam splitter, which splits the light, and it

298
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:22,798
gets reflected by these mirrors at the end.

299
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:26,318
And these mirrors basically sends the light again to the beam splitter. And the beam

300
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:30,066
splitter basically domains the light and to a

301
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:33,540
detector. So the vibrations that you see,

302
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,830
the mirrors that you see are moving. So these mirrors are moving

303
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,530
because of the phenomenon happening below. So somewhere

304
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,030
far in the galaxy,

305
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,754
there can be two black holes or two

306
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:53,542
massive celestial bodies or any binary black hole merger

307
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:56,998
or a neutron star neutron star merger or a neutron

308
00:19:57,174 --> 00:20:00,906
black hole merger happening. So once these

309
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:05,034
mergers, mergers start, so these massive bodies,

310
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:10,206
they start to revolve around each other. And as

311
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:13,858
you can see, what happens is they start to form

312
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:18,194
ripples in the spacetime fabric. And they walk the

313
00:20:18,312 --> 00:20:21,778
spacetime fabric around each other so much that they basically

314
00:20:21,864 --> 00:20:25,446
sort of create was in and around the spacetime. And if

315
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:28,386
you see, once they merge,

316
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:32,582
the merger happens. They become

317
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:35,638
a single body, a single massive body,

318
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:39,900
and the ripples basically

319
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:44,220
die out. And these ripples are the ripples that

320
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,486
cross the entire universe.

321
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:52,414
And it basically reaches the observatories. And once they

322
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:56,030
reach the observatories, they move these mirrors

323
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,786
back and forth. And these mirrors, once they are moved

324
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:03,940
back and forth, they basically change the

325
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,118
intensity of light that is falling upon these detectors

326
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:12,834
here. And the intensity variation that we get at

327
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:16,200
these detectors are being converted into

328
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:22,306
how much the earth was basically warped

329
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:26,280
around. So, if in very crude words,

330
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,406
I have to say. So these gravitational waves that are being sent

331
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:33,194
because of these black hole mergers that are happening,

332
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,474
they cross us almost every time.

333
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:40,342
And this is not just true with the black holes,

334
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:43,998
any body, when it moves. So even if I

335
00:21:44,004 --> 00:21:47,534
am moving my hand, it is creating gravitational wave ripples in

336
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:50,750
the spacetime fabric. But because my hand

337
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,914
or my body is not massive enough to warp the spacetime fabric that

338
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:57,502
much. So these ripples are very feeble.

339
00:21:57,646 --> 00:22:01,214
And the black hole mergers,

340
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:05,562
the ripples that it sends. So once these ripples

341
00:22:05,726 --> 00:22:09,110
basically move across the whole

342
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,886
complete earth or the complete spacetime fabric which contains the

343
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:17,426
earth and other planets and galaxies. So it basically stretches

344
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,194
and compresses the whole space and

345
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:24,634
whole space, meaning the earth and people,

346
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:28,582
me, you, everybody. So once these was

347
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:32,430
crosses, they basically are. We are

348
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,254
stretched and compressed. And these

349
00:22:36,292 --> 00:22:40,094
stretching and compression basically happen in the order of

350
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:44,318
ten to the power -34 to ten to the power -35 meters.

351
00:22:44,414 --> 00:22:47,266
It is very small, so we are not able to detect them.

352
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:51,218
And because the differences are very small,

353
00:22:51,384 --> 00:22:55,358
this small. So these massive detectors are used to

354
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:59,206
detect the small slightest of the variation in the intensity of

355
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:02,550
the laser light that is there. And then we basically

356
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,520
get to know what was like. Were there

357
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:12,518
any gravitational wave being crossing,

358
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:16,474
crossing the earth? And the reason you ask

359
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:20,102
why so many detectors in and around the globe is because

360
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:23,966
these detectors are so sensitive, so much sensitive that even if there is

361
00:23:23,988 --> 00:23:27,790
a car crossing across, like near any detector

362
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,350
or there is someone walking around the detectors,

363
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,458
they detect those noises also. And they

364
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:41,598
are also trapped in the output

365
00:23:41,774 --> 00:23:46,098
noise. So to separate

366
00:23:46,274 --> 00:23:49,606
all the noise sources, there are

367
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,414
seismic noises, there are quantum noises. There are

368
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,902
various types of noises that can cause

369
00:23:57,036 --> 00:24:00,646
certain kinds of waves. So one type

370
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,754
of signal will be common across all these detectors that you see

371
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:07,674
here. And that will be the gravitational wave that has crossed. And all

372
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,246
these detectors and various other detectors across the globe are being

373
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:14,846
developed because we want to just be confirmed that,

374
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:17,550
okay, there was a gravitational wave that has crossed.

375
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,686
Moving on with the topic. So this was just a very brief introduction

376
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,826
about what gravitational wave detectors are, how they work,

377
00:24:27,848 --> 00:24:31,380
and what gravitational waves are in general. So now

378
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:35,730
moving to the specific topics. So there's a type of noise.

379
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,934
The types of noise that I was talking to you about were

380
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:43,830
these different kinds of noises. The seismic noises,

381
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,050
gravity gradient noises, suspension noises, coating brownian noises,

382
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,802
quantum noises, computing thermodynamics. So all these noises are there,

383
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:55,578
like the mirrors are suspended. So they cause

384
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,338
certain types of noises. The coating on the mirrors, they cause a

385
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:03,226
certain type of noise in the output. These mirrors are hefty. The mirrors

386
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:06,910
are two to three story building high, and they

387
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,534
weigh in tons and they

388
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:15,474
cause a noise. The lasers are so much powerful that once

389
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:19,182
the lasers are like, they hit the mirrors.

390
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:22,846
So even though the mirrors are super cool, they still heat

391
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:26,178
up so much that the mirrors may expand or contract.

392
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,294
And that can basically add

393
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:33,798
up to the noises, the gases that are there

394
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:37,486
around the tube. These curvature of earth

395
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:40,774
also might vary the seismic

396
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:44,934
variations, the seismic activity that is there in these earth

397
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:48,780
that is happening. So all these things can actually

398
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,680
add up to various types of noises. And the

399
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,506
picture that you are seeing here is something called as advanced lego.

400
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:02,106
So it is very simplistic plot diagram

401
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:05,682
of how insides of those detectors look.

402
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:09,346
So there is a laser, it is being split into different modes. There is a

403
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:13,140
mode cleaning happening. And the lasers are basically

404
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,626
bouncing back to and forth in the four kilometer arm length.

405
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:22,742
And there is a

406
00:26:22,796 --> 00:26:27,062
multiplication happening of the detectors in the 615

407
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:30,486
kilowatts. And finally, the output is mapped

408
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:33,770
here. So the major contribution that happens

409
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,226
is one happening by the

410
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:40,598
quantum short noise. So if you see these graph here of the noise,

411
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:43,894
this purple line that you see is basically the quantum

412
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:47,294
shot noise. And these noises come into

413
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:51,326
picture because we are dealing with lasers. And lasers are basically

414
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:54,980
quantum particles which can behave in various ways.

415
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,302
So now if we move on with explanation.

416
00:27:00,366 --> 00:27:03,918
So these noises are significant when the gravitational wave

417
00:27:04,014 --> 00:27:07,794
detections are being made, because it happens due to quantum vacuum

418
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,962
fluctuations and quantum vacuum fluctuations.

419
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:14,614
And these topics are very hefty topics and

420
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:18,358
very advanced topics. So it can be covered in some other

421
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:22,266
talk way. So just now giving you a brief introduction and

422
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:26,618
keeping it open for you to explore is the quantum wave fluctuations, which you

423
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:31,110
can explore. And to overcome these quantum wave vacuum fluctuations,

424
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:35,470
the squeeze state of lights are used to reduce these short noises. And in general

425
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,846
increasing the signal to noise ratio. It helps in

426
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:42,346
detecting the faint gravitational waves, wave signatures and

427
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:46,402
various machine learning problem statement. Machine learning algorithms are

428
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,730
being used to basically identify the specific

429
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,294
gravitational waves that we want and remove

430
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:56,054
all these kind of noises that is already there.

431
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:59,446
So, talking about now we

432
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:03,126
have talked about quantum. Now we have talked about gravitational waves or

433
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,914
astrophysics in general and what are the methods

434
00:28:06,962 --> 00:28:11,034
that we can implement or propose so

435
00:28:11,072 --> 00:28:14,906
that we can leverage the use of quantum computers in the area of

436
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:18,410
astrophysics. So, talking about

437
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,254
the areas where this can come, so we can have

438
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:25,962
something like a quantum signal preprocessing. Then there is a measurement

439
00:28:26,026 --> 00:28:29,150
happening, and then there is a quantum signal post processing happening.

440
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,946
Okay, so this sort of can be a setup of

441
00:28:32,968 --> 00:28:36,766
the quantum signal preprocessing. We have the detection

442
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,286
happening and the post processing can be done. So we're

443
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:44,386
talking more about that. So the signal preprocessing is basically

444
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:48,094
the quantum information that is hidden in the potential gravitational

445
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:51,686
wave. So this method is basically tries to perform a

446
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:55,234
preprocessing step on the signal before it is measured. So the measurement

447
00:28:55,282 --> 00:28:58,646
step that we talked about that. So if I just quickly show

448
00:28:58,668 --> 00:29:02,054
these slide so the measurement is happening over here,

449
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:05,594
the output mode clean, there is an output mode cleaner, and there is a

450
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:09,162
measurement happening. So the measurement that is happening

451
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:13,050
here, before that, we can have a quantum preprocessing

452
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,174
happening, so that it basically takes

453
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:22,014
out the important quantum information that we have.

454
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:25,214
And it might provide a wider spectrum of data collection

455
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:28,514
by the opportunities, by using the Hilbert spaces that is

456
00:29:28,552 --> 00:29:31,694
available. So, this sort of experiment

457
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:35,006
is actually going on, and the research is going on in the GEo

458
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,686
600 observatory in Germany, and they

459
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:43,046
are focusing more on how to extract the quantum information which is

460
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:46,566
hidden in the gravitational waves, and give more information

461
00:29:46,668 --> 00:29:50,426
about the granularity of what the quantum information actually

462
00:29:50,528 --> 00:29:54,586
provides us to. So, moving on to the

463
00:29:54,768 --> 00:29:58,310
next step, which is the quantum signal post processing.

464
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,334
So, the present signal post processing that we

465
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:06,026
have is classical, and a quantum equivalent

466
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,418
of the selina post processing steps could be developed.

467
00:30:09,514 --> 00:30:13,386
Like there are many post processing

468
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:17,454
happening, which include machine learning algorithms. So, instead of the machine learning algorithms,

469
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:21,054
we can use more accurate and more efficient quantum machine learning algorithms.

470
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:24,446
And these quantum machine learning algorithms at larger

471
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:28,294
scale, with hefty data, they are proven to be more

472
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:32,134
accurate and provide more insights about how and

473
00:30:32,172 --> 00:30:36,200
what the things are, and give better predictions, and separate out things better.

474
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,154
And quantum machine learning is a topic which one

475
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:45,514
of my colleagues is talking about

476
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:49,002
at this conference. And it is a very niche area

477
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:52,334
where things can develop a lot.

478
00:30:52,452 --> 00:30:56,078
And the advantages that quantum machine learning can provide

479
00:30:56,164 --> 00:31:00,730
us can be used as one of the steps of the quantum signal post processing.

480
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,686
And the post processing, basically may increase the processing speed,

481
00:31:04,718 --> 00:31:07,762
and thus increase the accuracy of the signal isolation. So,

482
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:10,834
increasing the processing speed and basically will

483
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:14,334
help in increasing the signal isolation,

484
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:17,846
and the signal basically that we are wanting. So if

485
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:22,070
there is a binary black hole merger, the signals that we get across

486
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,346
the different detectors,

487
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:29,080
we can isolate it better and get more

488
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,806
accuracy along with it. And the errors can

489
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:38,166
also be isolated more efficiently. And the errors that we are

490
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:43,774
getting along with the

491
00:31:43,812 --> 00:31:47,518
gravitational waves, basically can be isolated more

492
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:51,040
by the quantum signal post processing that can happen.

493
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,622
So we move on further with the slide.

494
00:31:54,686 --> 00:31:58,770
So this is basically the picture that you see is basically

495
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,014
a frequency dependent squeezing for advanced Lego.

496
00:32:02,062 --> 00:32:05,586
And this is basically a setup that is

497
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:08,500
being tested out at these Geo 600,

498
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,126
by the GeO 600 team, along with the advanced lIgo. And it

499
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:18,458
is basically a 16 meters setup. And this

500
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:22,134
is the basic foundation of the idea. And the 16 m experiment

501
00:32:22,182 --> 00:32:26,010
that you see up bottom right

502
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,402
is basically what I was trying to talk about.

503
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:32,906
Like, we can have certain post processing

504
00:32:32,938 --> 00:32:36,634
steps, either in the form of optical setups

505
00:32:36,682 --> 00:32:40,558
or software setups, which can help in

506
00:32:40,644 --> 00:32:44,094
isolating the setup.

507
00:32:44,142 --> 00:32:48,334
And we can think it as a modular

508
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:51,982
setup, like say if there is a gravitational

509
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:55,506
wave that is coming and we isolate

510
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:58,850
it. And so we can make the setup more modular

511
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,866
and we can have different types of optical setups,

512
00:33:02,978 --> 00:33:07,154
specifically targeting a particular type of quantum algorithm

513
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:10,902
or quantum, or a quantum optic setup that we are looking into.

514
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:14,786
So this is an area where we can dive deep

515
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:18,758
into and come up with setups which can help

516
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:22,442
in, ah, not only improving

517
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:26,270
the quantum in the

518
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,346
gravitational wave detection step, but also developing

519
00:33:30,378 --> 00:33:34,334
on these areas will basically help us move closer

520
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:37,906
to the overall goal that we have in

521
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:41,806
the development of an experimental setup for quantum

522
00:33:41,838 --> 00:33:45,880
gravity. So the researches that

523
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,086
the team at the GEO 600 is doing may

524
00:33:50,188 --> 00:33:54,146
lead into the development of an experimental setup

525
00:33:54,178 --> 00:33:57,766
to prove the quantum

526
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:01,978
gravity and the existence of gravitons. And maybe these

527
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:06,054
developments will lead to advantages in various

528
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:09,958
fields also. So, moving on with the

529
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:13,918
topic. So the conclusions that we can drive out of

530
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:17,866
the talk will be so these methods

531
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:21,466
and researchers can help us explore the unknown

532
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:25,694
area of the quantum gravity. And they have potential

533
00:34:25,742 --> 00:34:29,614
to hypothesize a method to experimentally prove the existence of gravitons.

534
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:34,062
And the explorations may help in the development in the field of gravitational wave detection,

535
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:38,310
which will help the ever growing community of quantum computing enthusiasts.

536
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,326
Talking in general, the things that we

537
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,630
have developed in various areas previously,

538
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,886
like in these things that the cutting

539
00:34:50,998 --> 00:34:55,686
edge engineering feats that we developed

540
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,900
in the CERN colliders and

541
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,078
in the LIgo gravitational wave detectors. So a lot of

542
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:07,710
things are being used in various places in and around

543
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,258
world in various medical applications specifically.

544
00:35:11,354 --> 00:35:14,802
So these things that we

545
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:19,986
develop while researching in this field will

546
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:24,020
help improve the growing community of quantum enthusiasts. And also

547
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,134
maybe in future, if we develop more

548
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:31,942
on this topic, we'll be able to see how

549
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:36,546
we can hypothesize, can experimental

550
00:35:36,578 --> 00:35:39,640
setup to prove the existence of gravitons and

551
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,774
research more on the area of quantum gravity. And with

552
00:35:44,812 --> 00:35:49,266
that being said, I would like to conclude

553
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:54,126
the presentation, the talk, and thank

554
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:57,840
each and every member of the panel and the organizing team

555
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,854
for giving me the chance to present this talk in front

556
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:05,200
of the audience of the conference and

557
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,100
hope to see you again. And a very much thank you to all.
