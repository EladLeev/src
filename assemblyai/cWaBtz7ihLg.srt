00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,146
Hello everyone. How are you doing? My name is Jeronimo Medina Madruga,

2
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:34,114
and today we are going to talk about how to use Python

3
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:37,906
to create better math lessons. Jose da Silvera

4
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:41,542
Alvis is my advisor in my master's course and

5
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:44,600
has contributed to the creation of this content.

6
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,982
My masters these is in the field of

7
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:52,766
mathematical educators at the Pepe match program

8
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,022
in the Federal University of Pelotus, and it still is

9
00:00:57,076 --> 00:01:01,360
a work in progress, but it already gave me so much information

10
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,410
that I use part of it to create these talk.

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,990
My research is on how to use programming

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,838
to teach math to teams,

13
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:15,842
and at this moment, I have already read articles,

14
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:19,750
papers, books and thesis from all over the world,

15
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,350
trying to comprehend all the possibilities that technology

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,918
may add to the classroom. This talk will be very

17
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,186
light hearted, it won't be very technical, because there is

18
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:34,362
so much to talk in such a short time

19
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:38,662
that I think that if I went too deep in one or two tools,

20
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:42,590
we would miss the whole universe that is around

21
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,094
it. So if you want to

22
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:49,822
go deeper in some of the topics, you may

23
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,106
contact me. In the end of these

24
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:56,926
talk, there is my information, my contacting

25
00:01:56,958 --> 00:02:00,834
information, and if anyone may not have

26
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:04,866
noticed my accent, I would like to say that we

27
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,610
are from Brazil,

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,820
specifically from the south of Brazil, Hugh grand du Su.

29
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,234
And when we talk about Brazil,

30
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:19,254
it's the land of the best football there is. Especially when

31
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:22,794
we say that the real football is the one that we play with our

32
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,926
foots and the most amazing combination of samba,

33
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,754
Captain America and Mickey, something that you never see on

34
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:33,210
Disney plus. So if you notice some little failures

35
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,086
in my english, please just know that that is

36
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:40,922
my second language. And now, jokes aside,

37
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:45,070
I love to work with quotes and from my favorite authors,

38
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,498
I think that in this talk, I would be

39
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:51,678
obligated to come with Kitty Yates,

40
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:55,330
the author of the book the Math of Life and Death.

41
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,734
His quote is very interesting because I think that connect

42
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:03,702
with the emotion that I get

43
00:03:03,756 --> 00:03:08,458
when I start reading. All the experiences and many

44
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:12,138
scientists and authors that have before me

45
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:16,342
already went very deep

46
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:19,030
in this field of knowledge.

47
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,794
So the beauty of mathematics lies

48
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:26,654
first and foremost in its ability to act as

49
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:30,014
a practical tool to make sense of our complex world.

50
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:33,682
That's a great invitation to rethinking our

51
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:37,682
way that we view math, learning and

52
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:41,826
tech, because a lot of time we just think about numbers,

53
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:45,922
but we don't really connect them to our reality

54
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:49,414
somehow. So I would say that this is

55
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:53,654
the main topic of this talk, to rethink our relationship

56
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,800
with math and tech.

57
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,610
And the first question I would

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,820
say that my research led me to was

59
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,580
a traditional question, like, how do

60
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,334
students see math? And most of

61
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:18,314
us may have that impression that everybody hates

62
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:22,346
math because everyone criticize it, has problems.

63
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:26,194
But we are going to see that that's not really the

64
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:30,034
reality. Most teachers, like this

65
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:32,100
one that I'm quoting here,

66
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,806
actually show that students like math, or most

67
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:40,790
of the time they don't hate it. But it also points

68
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,562
out that the students have problems understanding

69
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:48,666
where they are going to apply the concepts. And sometimes that may be

70
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,710
one of the motives that leads them to not understanding

71
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,826
or even trying to go deeper in the

72
00:04:56,848 --> 00:05:01,038
field of math. So it's really

73
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:04,958
important that educators understand that and start

74
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:08,414
to see how the students see

75
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:11,440
math, not only what they are trying to teach.

76
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,420
And although we may see that

77
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,110
students don't really hate math,

78
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,302
at least here in Brazil, we are seeing, and most countries

79
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,894
in development, we are seeing that the

80
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:31,238
performance and evaluations of

81
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:35,462
the students is not going so

82
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:39,802
well. Most of these countries are suffering. Some even

83
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:43,786
are not evolving. And that may

84
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:46,582
be indicated by tests such as Pisa.

85
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:50,302
And we have to really understand that,

86
00:05:50,356 --> 00:05:54,142
okay, we have students that like math, but we aren't able

87
00:05:54,196 --> 00:05:56,880
to improve the quality of our education.

88
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,154
And although we

89
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:06,580
are unfortunately not improving the quality of our education,

90
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,202
we are seeing a world that needs most of

91
00:06:11,256 --> 00:06:14,500
our math. We are seeing that

92
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,970
almost the new careers,

93
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,894
new jobs that are arising within this information

94
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,794
technology, the digital age, they are connected

95
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:29,142
to the traditional Stein fields, which is science,

96
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:33,418
technology, engineering and mathematics. And we

97
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:37,766
might even say that some of the manual labor

98
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:41,614
shall be automated in the next decade more

99
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:45,534
than it has happened before. And that

100
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,230
makes us think what we are going to do, how we are going to

101
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,622
make this transition. We are going to have to

102
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:55,994
really rethink what we are teaching, how we are teaching,

103
00:06:56,042 --> 00:07:00,322
because we need more than ever to have

104
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:04,274
students that are really good with the technical side,

105
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:08,146
with math, with technology. And that's

106
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,842
really important. And another quote

107
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:15,958
that I think that's essential to this little

108
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:20,130
revolution that I'm trying to spark here is from Seth Godin

109
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,290
in his free e book, stop stealing dreams,

110
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,222
when he's talking about how fast the modern

111
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:30,606
world has changed because of technology and

112
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:34,826
the industry and everything. He says the economy

113
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:38,554
has changed, possibly forever, but the school hasn't

114
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:42,378
changed. So it's really important that we understand

115
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:47,294
that our education, how it's functioning

116
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,442
today, and how can we change it for the better. I'm not

117
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:55,002
saying, like some may say that, oh, our education sucks,

118
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:58,614
let's burn the books. Let's throw everything away.

119
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,326
But I think that we can really do better than we

120
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:06,280
are doing as of this moment.

121
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,730
And in order to do that, we must first

122
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,050
ask ourselves, how are we really learning

123
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,730
math traditionally?

124
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,502
Well, I think that everybody that has done

125
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:25,150
calculus, algebra, geometry, shall remember

126
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,466
these infinite amount of exercise that our teachers recommended

127
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:33,294
to us, hundreds exercise of calculus,

128
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:36,398
of integrals and euler theory.

129
00:08:36,494 --> 00:08:40,082
And these repetition might be

130
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,390
essential to understand how to solve the equations

131
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,662
and problems. But does it

132
00:08:46,716 --> 00:08:50,134
help us to understand what really is going

133
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:53,958
on beside the numbers, beside the solution itself,

134
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:57,866
what it represents in reality? How does

135
00:08:57,888 --> 00:09:01,482
it connect? And does that motivate the

136
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:05,894
students? Or it might make them a little miserable

137
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:10,158
and frustrated when they have issues. Because a

138
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:13,630
lot of times some students may have trouble

139
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,374
understanding how to calculate something,

140
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:21,390
and because they don't even understand how it

141
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,980
connects to the world around them, they just give up.

142
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,130
And on top of that, when we are talking about

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,986
math, we are mostly talking about X-Y-Z

144
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:37,650
delta angles, using square root,

145
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,550
euler and quadratic equations.

146
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,422
But can we translate those

147
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:47,810
variables to reality? Well, we can. But are we,

148
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,914
can we connect our studies with what we

149
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:55,894
see around us? Do we really understand what it's

150
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:59,302
being represented in the problems that we are solving?

151
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:02,974
I think this repetition and abstraction might

152
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:06,350
be the first problems that we might see with

153
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,134
the traditional education. And then

154
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:15,010
we have to think, do the students really learn from this?

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,834
From my personal opinion and from most that

156
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:22,066
I have found from my research, I think

157
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,926
it's safe to say that we have real issues to

158
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:29,574
deal with when we talk about learning, especially when

159
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:33,398
we talk about math. If we look at the numbers from

160
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:36,838
universities, from schools, we may see that

161
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:40,358
most subjects that are connected to math have

162
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:44,026
a really high number of students who fail or drop out

163
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:48,074
of classes, or even the traditional educators or

164
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:52,000
course. And most of the time it's due to having

165
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,734
a really poor foundation of these concepts that are

166
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:58,240
required to understand.

167
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,586
So we really have to change when

168
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:07,794
you are talking about teens and kids, how they are learning,

169
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:11,586
so they really think that they understand

170
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:14,986
more math, not just, oh, I know how to use this formula,

171
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:18,294
but I don't know anyway how this connects to

172
00:11:18,332 --> 00:11:22,278
my reality. And okay,

173
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:26,258
we get that students like math, but studying math

174
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:29,820
in the most traditional methods suck a little.

175
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,434
But still, there is another piece to

176
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:37,674
this puzzle, which is making the school, these teachers and

177
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,942
the students understand how important

178
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,680
math is in our modern world.

179
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,382
And this

180
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:52,334
meme makes me think, because sometimes we see

181
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:55,858
people just reading at these screen and trying to do everything

182
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:59,794
that they learn from it, or they see,

183
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:03,634
I don't think that's learning most of the time. We even call it

184
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:06,962
sometimes in programming, the famous tutorial

185
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,934
hell where people just learn to repeat, repeat, repeat what

186
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:15,000
they see on YouTube and other

187
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,634
channels, other media, but they don't really think,

188
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:24,940
and that's really important. In order to

189
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,842
have a better education, we must first

190
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:33,150
have to stop thinking only in solving the equations and

191
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,766
drawing graphs for the most of our time,

192
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:40,958
learning math, and really make the student a protagonist in their

193
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:44,580
quest for knowledge. The student have to

194
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,638
know what they are learning and have a genuine

195
00:12:48,814 --> 00:12:50,420
interest in that.

196
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,206
And the great part about all of this is

197
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:58,374
that, at least in theory, we already may

198
00:12:58,412 --> 00:13:02,066
have a lot of answers. We have seen the rise

199
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:06,806
of many pedagogical strategies that are

200
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:10,380
very easy to deal with this issue and many more,

201
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,770
I would say, like project based learning,

202
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,690
the famous PBL, the use of gamification,

203
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,546
flipped classroom, and many other modern

204
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:25,280
education strategies have already

205
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,294
dealt with this problem. Most of them have

206
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,790
in common the fact that these make the students actively

207
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,010
seek answers and research, and sometimes even seek questions

208
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,430
itself, and that helps to motivate

209
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,182
them to learn more and be more engaged

210
00:13:45,246 --> 00:13:48,866
in the classroom. And we

211
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:52,594
could talk about papers, piaget, Paul Frery,

212
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:55,122
bell hooks, vigotsky,

213
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,674
ZDP, many other classical thinkers

214
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:02,454
and concepts related to education. But I

215
00:14:02,492 --> 00:14:06,242
will try to make a simple example out of tv series,

216
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:09,902
and I really hope that I'm not giving any

217
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:13,774
foiler doing so. Cobra Kai is

218
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:17,230
in its fourth season now,

219
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,258
and in order to teach the best karate, the Miyagi

220
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:24,674
do and ego Feng dojos have to teach their

221
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:28,478
students together, mixing their style and lessons.

222
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:32,114
And that way we can relate to the

223
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:35,702
concept of praxis, which is a classical concept that

224
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:38,934
connects education in a way

225
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:43,666
that we have to mix practical

226
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:47,894
teachers and theory teaching together in order to achieve

227
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:51,642
better results. We shouldn't just

228
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:55,050
focus on creating something. We have to create

229
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,842
something and at the same

230
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:02,190
time try to teach the theory behind it.

231
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,950
So we have the student engaged and learning

232
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,118
the concepts. And that is really important.

233
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:13,054
I think that most of the classical thinkers

234
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:16,658
that I have said would connect a

235
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:20,340
little to this Cobra Kai connection here.

236
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,862
Okay, I think that most of us will agree with that,

237
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,040
but how can we do that?

238
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,522
We will have to change our approach to traditional

239
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:37,694
math. Like in this example, everyone learns

240
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:41,146
how to solve quadratic equation during their high

241
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:44,762
school years. But do you know what

242
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:48,346
you are going to do with it? Well, some of

243
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:51,774
us might even still remember that we

244
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:55,146
can draw a parabola from the quadratic equation.

245
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:58,922
We may have the roots of the equation, the delta,

246
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:02,946
and. Okay, but how

247
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:06,434
is that connected to your reality, to the reality of the

248
00:16:06,472 --> 00:16:10,974
student? Simple example, a parabola

249
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:15,386
or a quadratic equation may represent the jump

250
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:19,474
of a character. Or when you throw

251
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:23,158
a ball in a basketball, or anything

252
00:16:23,244 --> 00:16:26,774
that has movement, it can

253
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:30,186
be connected to that formula. So one of

254
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:34,826
the ways that we can teach quadratic equation in

255
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:38,666
a way that it's not only about variables and numbers

256
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:42,766
is trying to create an animation that

257
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,462
works inside a game that

258
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:50,240
may be one of the most effective was to teach.

259
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,094
And while we are in that subject,

260
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:58,254
we can see that a lot of math concepts are connected

261
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:01,730
and scattered around the gaming world.

262
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,534
For example, I am a really big fan of fighting games,

263
00:17:05,662 --> 00:17:09,382
especially street fighter. And in order to understand the game

264
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:13,526
at its highest level, you need to understand these animations for the

265
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:17,538
moves and the frame data there is so that you

266
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:20,922
can work in a mathematical way

267
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:24,278
of how a move should behave.

268
00:17:24,454 --> 00:17:27,802
How should you react, what should you

269
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:31,822
bet that would be the right answer to your

270
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:35,406
opponent? And so it's not only about

271
00:17:35,508 --> 00:17:38,846
how you can, and sure you can, it's about numbers,

272
00:17:38,948 --> 00:17:41,920
calculations going on all the time.

273
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,842
And we can also use music creation as

274
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:49,330
a topic to learn math, from formulas to create sounds,

275
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,250
to compass, to rhythm, to tempo. There are many

276
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,662
mathematical concepts involved in the creation of music.

277
00:17:56,796 --> 00:18:00,710
You can't have tango, pop, r and b without

278
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,614
numbers on the background. So as

279
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:08,566
we can see now, it's really easy to see mathematical

280
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:12,154
concepts being used all over the world of technology.

281
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:16,106
And that might be essential to develop

282
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,366
the education for the generations that are growing

283
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:23,822
up nowadays. Okay, although technology

284
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:26,430
might seem the silver bullet,

285
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,458
I have found many hiccups that might occur

286
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:35,362
when we see who already tried this

287
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:39,314
change in education. First of

288
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:43,330
all, we have the expression these in Brazil, that when

289
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,978
something is really expensive, like oh, can iPhone,

290
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,938
that it costs a kidney.

291
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:53,618
And well, as we can see from this slide,

292
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:56,898
some math solutions really cost a kidney,

293
00:18:56,994 --> 00:19:00,230
especially in countries that are in development,

294
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,514
because the exchange rate to

295
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:07,642
dollar and euro and other most

296
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:11,134
popular currencies is really high.

297
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,566
So how high would it be?

298
00:19:13,668 --> 00:19:16,682
Well, in our case here in Brazil,

299
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:20,526
$1 would be almost six

300
00:19:20,628 --> 00:19:23,874
hais. And if you want

301
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:28,066
to think about that, you have to also think about

302
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:32,062
import technology and hardware and paying license

303
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:35,800
fees. And you also might even think,

304
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,050
one of the problems is that nowadays, most software,

305
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:43,554
you aren't really buying it perpetual

306
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:46,934
license. You are going to buy it for one

307
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:50,170
year or two years or sometime.

308
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,330
So if you think about the

309
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,894
cost of disclosed proprietary

310
00:19:58,022 --> 00:20:02,474
technology, I think that most public institutions

311
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:06,062
and even most private ones would not

312
00:20:06,116 --> 00:20:10,574
really have a way to deal with that. And also,

313
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:14,018
if we had the money that we don't have most of

314
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:17,266
the time, I would have to say that a lot of these

315
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:20,622
solutions based on proprietary software

316
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:24,610
may be quite limited. They remind me a little bit

317
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,438
of the calculation machine, also known as the

318
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:31,702
Skinner machine, and it

319
00:20:31,756 --> 00:20:35,960
was one of the first machines focused on mathematical education.

320
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,834
It was basically a machine that fed the student with a

321
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:43,302
problem, allowed him to write his solution,

322
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:46,986
and also gave him the correct answer after.

323
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:51,338
So it indeed was useful because it allowed

324
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:55,214
these student to understand if he was right or

325
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:58,894
wrong. And it was

326
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,442
created many decades ago. So in that

327
00:21:02,516 --> 00:21:06,594
time it was revolutionary. Today it's not

328
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,418
so much, but still it doesn't leave a

329
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:14,466
lot of room to create or explore or to understand

330
00:21:14,568 --> 00:21:18,566
the nature of the errors that might occur while

331
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:22,150
the students trying to solve the problem. And that is really

332
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,880
essential to a good education.

333
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,006
Also, when we talk about disclosure solutions,

334
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:33,882
most of them aren't internationalized, which means

335
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:37,290
that students that aren't american or

336
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,214
don't have English as their primary language, and even

337
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:44,814
the teachers that might have to use these

338
00:21:44,852 --> 00:21:48,446
tools will have to deal with another setback in

339
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:51,994
order to use the software learning commands and interface

340
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:55,602
in another language. I have to highlight that,

341
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:59,074
because here in Brazil we have really low

342
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,302
percentage of students and teachers who are fluent

343
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:06,120
in English, and that might be a really

344
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:10,550
big bump on the path to a better teaching methodology.

345
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,882
And we also have to say that in South America,

346
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:19,014
the hardware costs are rising almost every

347
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:23,014
day in the last few years due to the

348
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:26,598
weak currents that we already have talked about due

349
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:30,554
to taxes, to the pandemic, to the scarcity of

350
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:34,182
components, and even competing with cryptocurrency

351
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:37,722
mining, which I will never forgive

352
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:41,706
bitcoin for that. But even in educators

353
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:45,106
facilities that were already more structured in the

354
00:22:45,128 --> 00:22:48,978
past, we still have some old equipment almost

355
00:22:49,064 --> 00:22:52,958
everywhere. So it's vital that software solutions

356
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:56,774
may be as simple was they can be, and that they

357
00:22:56,812 --> 00:22:59,682
can run in an open source environment,

358
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,930
just not only on Windows or Mac.

359
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,482
And a lot of educational

360
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:09,446
facilities here still use Linux.

361
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:12,650
Amen to that. Okay,

362
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,958
that leaves the question. Buying a software package

363
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:20,140
may really solve the problem related to technology.

364
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,378
Or should we focus on another type of solution,

365
00:23:24,554 --> 00:23:28,430
given that these is a python conference? I really think that

366
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,840
these is a very easy question to answer, of course.

367
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,082
But the really big question is related not

368
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:40,530
only to technology, but the whole scenario around it that

369
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,178
we have just described it. How can we make the learning

370
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:47,080
experience more effective for the students.

371
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,166
First of all, I think that a part of this solution is

372
00:23:52,268 --> 00:23:56,018
really outside of the question. We need that governments,

373
00:23:56,114 --> 00:24:00,282
schools, universities, educators, communities and many

374
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:04,122
others to understand that we need this

375
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,574
change based on that. We need new curriculums

376
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:11,278
like we can see already for quite some time and already

377
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:13,310
working in England,

378
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,694
Australia, Israel, China. I think that

379
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:21,930
Sweden, I have seen Latonia

380
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:26,034
and many other countries that already are

381
00:24:26,072 --> 00:24:29,602
trying to fit in programming and technology

382
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:33,762
inside the reality of each student. It is

383
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:38,002
also important that the teachers may participate

384
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:41,398
in programs that may refine and

385
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:45,266
update their skills and their views regarding

386
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:47,934
to the usage of technology in the classroom,

387
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:51,210
as we can't really make these change

388
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,874
without the contribution of teachers. And some of

389
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:58,780
them have not

390
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,262
been around so much technology as

391
00:25:03,316 --> 00:25:08,106
we might have seen with the newest generations.

392
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,934
So it's really important that we stop at

393
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:15,922
this moment and say, okay, we have to first of all

394
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:20,050
teach the teachers to have

395
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,098
a different view on technology and how they are going to use it

396
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:27,654
in their classroom. And in order to do that,

397
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:31,794
we have to create this link between math

398
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:35,894
and technology. The good news is there is a lot of

399
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:39,878
people around the world already thinkinkering with new educational

400
00:25:39,974 --> 00:25:43,210
concepts that may build this bridge between

401
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,046
these traditional fields. In our case, we are talking about math,

402
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,770
but we can do this with physics,

403
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,466
with language, with communication, with chemistry.

404
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:58,910
Everything that you can think now can connect to programming and

405
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,454
technology. And I may suggest one example

406
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:07,286
from my fellow friend and colleague Rafael Spetch,

407
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:10,990
who shows how to play around creating

408
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,462
images and sound by using math and the

409
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:19,106
web audio API. The link is in the source

410
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:22,726
of these slide and it's essential that

411
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:26,674
we risk this type of experimentation, new types

412
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:30,490
of education that goes well beyond the

413
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,214
traditional hello world when we talk about programming,

414
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:37,914
because we really need students to

415
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,598
be creative and to learn to deal with problem

416
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,830
solving that are

417
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,878
required traits to many of the new fields of work that

418
00:26:48,964 --> 00:26:52,880
are coming from this digital age.

419
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,180
Now we can talk a little bit of already

420
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,202
there are a lot of open tools out there and at

421
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:06,994
this specific moment, I'm not going to talk about Python.

422
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,726
There is a motive about that. And I'm going

423
00:27:10,748 --> 00:27:14,230
to start with logo. Logo is one of the most

424
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,282
traditional and maybe the oldest solution that

425
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,946
connects math and digital technology

426
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:25,100
as a teachers tool.

427
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:29,002
And it has already more than 50 years since

428
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:32,426
its creation. So what its basics

429
00:27:32,538 --> 00:27:36,362
allows us to do is to work with geometry related

430
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:40,622
skills by creating shapes, drawings and much more through the

431
00:27:40,676 --> 00:27:44,094
usage of its interpreted language,

432
00:27:44,222 --> 00:27:48,482
which is really easy to use and quite direct. It just

433
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:52,530
feels like drawing on a board, but with your keyboard.

434
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,742
Another tool that has been quite popular in classrooms in the last

435
00:27:56,796 --> 00:28:00,662
couple of years is scratch. That's created by the

436
00:28:00,716 --> 00:28:04,486
MIT Media lab, and it uses really simple

437
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:08,006
visual blocks to create a programming language that's

438
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:11,354
so simple that you just have to click and drag to create

439
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,950
your program. And scratch has managed

440
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,442
to be used from small

441
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:22,238
kids all the way up to the university, and even

442
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:26,126
to teach teachers, as we have said before,

443
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:29,802
to really deal with technology in the classroom,

444
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:33,294
to really use it in their reality. And it

445
00:28:33,332 --> 00:28:36,458
has a really simple learning curve.

446
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:39,938
And it's also multi language by design,

447
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:43,314
so it's really easy to everyone to use it. You can

448
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:46,566
manipulate visual objects, you can interact with the

449
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:50,022
user, you can calculate variables with this really

450
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:53,538
simple interface. And I'm

451
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:56,726
a big fan of Samaro. He's one of

452
00:28:56,748 --> 00:28:58,870
the creators of Sonkipi.

453
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,850
That's an ed and also a programming language that

454
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,530
uses the language rails under the hood.

455
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,898
And the ide. And programming language

456
00:29:13,994 --> 00:29:17,694
allows us to create music, to create sample and sounds by

457
00:29:17,732 --> 00:29:21,326
using programming. And it's really interesting

458
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:25,042
to see how many loops and variables it takes to

459
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,978
recreate some popular songs out there. If you research a

460
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:32,514
little bit about it, you can see people creating Star

461
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:35,846
wars music, Mario music, everything that you

462
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:39,480
may think about, there is already

463
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,040
a little code that turns into a beautiful music.

464
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,774
And, okay, of course, we are in a python conference.

465
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:51,718
We have to talk about Python,

466
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:54,918
and it would be very disappointing.

467
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:57,980
Like if you go to see Spider man,

468
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,394
no way home and finding out there were no three different Spider

469
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:06,090
man in that movie, that was a lot of expectation,

470
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,918
and I think that's also the expectation that

471
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:13,874
most of us have here in this talk. And when we

472
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:17,666
talk about Python and math, first thing

473
00:30:17,768 --> 00:30:21,906
that most people will say is that Python can

474
00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:26,150
be used as a calculator. And that's not wrong. That's great.

475
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,862
But I really think that there is so much more

476
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:34,198
than that we can do with it. First of all,

477
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:38,374
I think that people have trouble understanding

478
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:41,450
how programming languages really work.

479
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,222
So I would like to point out a tool that's

480
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:49,340
not directly connected to the math context of this

481
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,254
talk. But it's a great tool to teach

482
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:58,014
people that are starting to learn how to program.

483
00:30:58,212 --> 00:31:01,742
And it's called Python tutor, and it's an

484
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:05,458
online tool that allows us to see how

485
00:31:05,544 --> 00:31:09,790
a program would work in a visual representation

486
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,202
of variables, lists, and many

487
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:17,080
other data structure that may work within a program.

488
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:22,290
Next up, we have the turtle model. That gives us the ability

489
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,662
to use logo commands and have the same resources of

490
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:30,906
the original language, but this time using it

491
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:33,530
within a Python environment.

492
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,262
Well, as I have said, that Python

493
00:31:38,326 --> 00:31:42,234
should not be seen only as a calculator.

494
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:47,360
But the truth is there is a lot of

495
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,694
modules that are really handy in that department and

496
00:31:51,732 --> 00:31:54,980
we could not talk about them.

497
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,690
One of this is the math module that

498
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,334
allows us to use most of the traditional math

499
00:32:02,382 --> 00:32:05,506
functions that are defined by the C standard,

500
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:09,302
like the factory of function. So a lot of things

501
00:32:09,356 --> 00:32:12,770
that sometimes you have to program in another language

502
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,402
in Python, you have, oh, okay, it's already packed,

503
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:20,540
you can use it. And we also have the

504
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,774
iTEr tools module that makes it easier to calculate

505
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:27,766
iterations, permutations and combinations.

506
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:31,294
And we could also talk, I think,

507
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:35,866
most of these time of this talk about other modules

508
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:38,702
like these statistics and so on.

509
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:42,382
But I decided to show the ones that I have

510
00:32:42,436 --> 00:32:45,620
used so far more in my research

511
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,934
and that are more related to what I'm

512
00:32:49,982 --> 00:32:53,506
researching at this moment. And now

513
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:57,174
going outside of the traditional Python modules, we can

514
00:32:57,212 --> 00:33:00,838
see a vast array of tools that our community have built

515
00:33:00,924 --> 00:33:04,758
for many different objectives. For example,

516
00:33:04,924 --> 00:33:09,142
Jyton music might be an alternative to Sonicpy,

517
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:12,746
and also there are other tools to create

518
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:17,094
music with Python. I'm still learning Jytum,

519
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:21,086
but the jytom music environment, how to use it. But I

520
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:24,030
think that it has a good potential.

521
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,158
And another two tools that I think that

522
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:31,882
is essential to talk about is the blockpy

523
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:35,442
and the Ado blocks that work in a

524
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:39,166
similar way. That makes scratch

525
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:43,870
programming so amazing. That works with block programming.

526
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,702
And the most interesting thing about both of these

527
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:51,250
tools is that they allow to create traditional

528
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,982
Python code so that we can use the

529
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,486
visual programming, the block programming

530
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:01,718
as an introduction to programming with Python,

531
00:34:01,814 --> 00:34:05,354
and make that transition from block programming to

532
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:08,650
traditional programming a little easier.

533
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:12,814
And now one of the most amazing tools out

534
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:16,078
there is Pygame. Okay.

535
00:34:16,164 --> 00:34:19,854
Pygame is focused on a set

536
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,454
of modules that make it easier to work with SDL

537
00:34:23,502 --> 00:34:27,186
functions, and that allows us to create

538
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:30,914
games very easy and very fast.

539
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:35,114
And now we are not talking about creating

540
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:38,178
games as, oh, we are going to sell games.

541
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:42,146
No, that's not these focus here, but allowing

542
00:34:42,178 --> 00:34:45,798
these students to create. And also

543
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:49,942
when they are creating, these are using to be manipulating the environment

544
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,462
and mathematical concepts around it. So that's

545
00:34:53,526 --> 00:34:56,938
very important. And also they can create

546
00:34:57,024 --> 00:35:00,510
digital assets that they might play a little after

547
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,302
all the work is done. And if we

548
00:35:04,356 --> 00:35:08,110
really want to go deeper, for those thinking about

549
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,614
data science, we have anaconda that not

550
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:15,054
only is one of the best tools to install Python

551
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:18,674
environment, but it's already one of the

552
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:21,906
most used tools around these world in this field of

553
00:35:21,928 --> 00:35:25,894
knowledge, allowing an easy setup with a few

554
00:35:25,932 --> 00:35:28,994
commands and clicks and having the best tools

555
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:32,674
out there. Most of the data science

556
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:36,662
tutorials point out anaconda as

557
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:40,460
their default tool. And one of the tools that

558
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,970
are included in this anaconda package that it's worth talking

559
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,610
about is the Jupiter notebook.

560
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,494
If someone doesn't know it, it allows these

561
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:56,478
creation of digital notebooks that might include text,

562
00:35:56,564 --> 00:36:00,430
image, snippets of code and much, much more,

563
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,494
making it these ideal tool to create your digital classroom.

564
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:08,210
You create really an interactive book with

565
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,674
programming inside of it. You can really create

566
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:16,680
an environment so the student can learn

567
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,838
what are these concepts? And after it he can program

568
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:25,010
and go building his portfolio

569
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,300
of programming with these tool.

570
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,166
And we could go on and on and on about all the tools

571
00:36:34,198 --> 00:36:38,406
that Python provides that are related to math,

572
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:41,680
but we have not a lot of time.

573
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,086
And also the most important thing that I would like to

574
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:50,654
point here and to show is that Python is

575
00:36:50,692 --> 00:36:54,034
not only about the language. We have many open

576
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:58,194
source languages that are great, but the

577
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:02,158
great difference in my point of view is the ecosystem

578
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:05,426
around of it that has so many solutions

579
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:09,030
that might help you, your class, your teachers,

580
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,690
your community, to create better lessons,

581
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,390
to create a better classroom. Most of the time you don't

582
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,954
really have to create something new. You have to only understand

583
00:37:23,152 --> 00:37:27,180
what is the right kind of package to this situation.

584
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,238
And also, I really have to say that,

585
00:37:32,324 --> 00:37:35,386
don't forget the number one recommendation.

586
00:37:35,578 --> 00:37:39,614
Read the documentation. Most of the problems that

587
00:37:39,812 --> 00:37:43,442
already have been dealt with when we talk about

588
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:47,282
Python modules and everything, but it's just a matter

589
00:37:47,416 --> 00:37:51,282
of understanding how the functions work and how

590
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,900
the tools that you are using may help

591
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,758
you. Okay, how can we

592
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:02,998
use everything that we have just talked about? I love

593
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:07,030
a simple example here to just wrap up this presentation

594
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:11,482
that is creating a snake game. It's really simple and

595
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:14,778
we think, oh, it's a game. What we are really talking

596
00:38:14,864 --> 00:38:18,822
here, we can say that it's

597
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:22,414
only about 100 lines of codes that

598
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:25,774
you are not going to really learn so

599
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:28,478
much about it.

600
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:32,026
But in the big but here, the snake

601
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:36,180
game isn't only about the snake game, it's about

602
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,990
math. And when we talk about vectors,

603
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,842
about speed, about the direction,

604
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:48,418
it's really what we are doing. When you are reading

605
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:52,198
the keys and the movement, everything around

606
00:38:52,284 --> 00:38:57,174
that. And that is really important because most

607
00:38:57,212 --> 00:39:01,194
of the time when I use this example and show people how to

608
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:04,442
like in an hour and a half,

609
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:08,220
you can create this Python code to work

610
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:13,534
as a snake game. People are really

611
00:39:13,572 --> 00:39:16,638
impressed, first of all,

612
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:20,110
that it's really so simple to create this code.

613
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,534
And after that they

614
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:29,150
really love the fact that it's math and

615
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:33,230
they don't realize it sometimes when they are building it.

616
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,094
And that's so great. And I think that

617
00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:41,000
we have to have more this kind of experience

618
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:45,202
in the classroom. We have to create digital assets

619
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:48,474
and make these content around of it.

620
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:51,980
When you are building, you are learning at these same time.

621
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,906
And okay, I have convinced you, you are interested,

622
00:39:57,008 --> 00:40:00,814
you want to know more. If that's the case, I will

623
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:04,350
refer you to some of my favorite

624
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,366
material. First of all, I'm really a

625
00:40:08,388 --> 00:40:12,110
big can of Al swagers. He has this book. You can find

626
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,154
most of it online and free,

627
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:18,610
but if you can also buy it, that would be great.

628
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,526
That's inventing your own computer games with Python.

629
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:27,122
And it's not a book that talks directly

630
00:40:27,186 --> 00:40:30,870
with math, but when you see these examples,

631
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:36,422
you are going to have the same kind of view

632
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:40,682
that I have talked about the Snake game, that every game has

633
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:43,386
a lot of math concepts behind it.

634
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:47,254
And math adventures with Python from Peter

635
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:50,766
Fahel. It's already one of my

636
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:53,934
favorite books because it teaches so much from

637
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:57,566
math that you think that you are learning Python and

638
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,920
you are learning math with it.

639
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,714
And that's the same experience that I

640
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,866
get from Amit Saha. And both of

641
00:41:06,888 --> 00:41:10,562
them also have YouTube and also

642
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:14,594
eager also was YouTube channel and YouTube videos of

643
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:18,902
them talking about it. And so it's really amazing.

644
00:41:19,036 --> 00:41:22,582
I'm really passionate about it. I think that this

645
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:26,200
is the kind of book that can really make the difference.

646
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:30,202
And also I really like. It's a little old now,

647
00:41:30,256 --> 00:41:33,882
but I think that this video from

648
00:41:34,016 --> 00:41:38,330
the Pycon Australia from Liam Calloway talking

649
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,774
about his experience of using math in

650
00:41:41,812 --> 00:41:45,130
the university to teach Python.

651
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,590
It's great and it's really

652
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,234
one of the shortest talks that I have recommended

653
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:56,082
and might be even better than these talk that you are seeing

654
00:41:56,216 --> 00:42:00,466
here today, now. And just

655
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:04,402
so we can end it all, the last

656
00:42:04,456 --> 00:42:08,534
quote from John Dewey, can educator that

657
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,974
I think that summarize everything that we have talked so

658
00:42:12,012 --> 00:42:15,270
far in a more theoretical way.

659
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,662
If we teach today as we learned yesterday,

660
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:21,610
we are robbing students of these tomorrow.

661
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,740
So, guys and girls, that's it.

662
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,642
Find me or these slides. There is my

663
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:33,770
contact email, Twitter, my slideshare. I will upload

664
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:37,454
the slides shortly. And I have

665
00:42:37,492 --> 00:42:40,960
to just thank everyone for watching

666
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,686
and hope all of you or some of you

667
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:48,510
might get this passion about

668
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,310
math and python and starting fingering and experimenting

669
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,226
and bye.
