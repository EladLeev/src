1
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,730
Setting up intelligent observability business architecture approach

2
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,442
today in the agenda we'll be talking on trends

3
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:35,186
and shifts in observability, the need of multilayered

4
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:38,674
observability and the proposed business architecture

5
00:00:38,722 --> 00:00:43,394
approach. What are recent trends and shifts we see in the intelligent observability

6
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:47,090
area? One the maturity in the SRE

7
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,774
space. What we see is that the SRE function,

8
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:55,918
the various processes and the engineering teams working together.

9
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:59,550
It's becoming more and more on the ground and mature.

10
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,640
Next when we see the systems health.

11
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,494
Now there are more correlation available with the business metrics.

12
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:10,622
Business metrics as in the sales, the manufacturing

13
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:14,306
metrics and the customer experience associated with

14
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:18,274
the sales. All that correlations the business applications

15
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:21,846
SRE happening with systems health and so that we

16
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:24,870
can correlate how the business is functioning.

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,820
Generative aiops now this is a trend where

18
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,542
the generative AI OpS means it is generating

19
00:01:33,606 --> 00:01:37,514
more and more insights using AI ML and plethora of

20
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:41,066
data sets available through operations, data alerts

21
00:01:41,098 --> 00:01:43,760
from systems, hardware and others.

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,014
This generative AI Ops has lot of promise because it will

23
00:01:48,052 --> 00:01:51,674
use large language models. It will bring up thorough

24
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:55,246
insights and can correlate through deep learning techniques.

25
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:58,798
Also enterprise architecture.

26
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:02,670
Now enterprise architecture is really responding

27
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:06,754
on taking on observability tooling. We see that

28
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:10,722
the tooling is getting tied with the business processes.

29
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:14,146
It is coming together with how the architecture

30
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:18,006
of either a cloud environment or business application

31
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:21,974
is planned. Observability is key in the design stage

32
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:25,594
and that's how enterprise architects are working, making in the

33
00:02:25,632 --> 00:02:29,466
design principles. And when we develop it, when we put it

34
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:33,610
into production, it brings the real insights based on the observability

35
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,560
setup. Done. Moving on.

36
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,070
Now you can see in this figure there is lot

37
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,226
of application space and there

38
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:47,986
SRE various channels, whether online cloud

39
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:52,286
SaaS applications, partner applications, the B two B applications

40
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,238
on payments and supplies and logistics.

41
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:59,826
And then there is an integration happening with the systems

42
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:04,050
of records. Now this systems of record is sitting in the data layer.

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,550
Now data has like data on customers, data on transactions,

44
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,810
data on systems, data on third party suppliers.

45
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,682
Now what is happening is these all are giving

46
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:20,170
multiple transactions and thanks to the

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,450
cloud environments, it's getting into hyperscaling.

48
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,326
What is required is afresh with this architecture approach is

49
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:31,146
needed where we can establish the multilayer

50
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,866
observability. Multilayer observability.

51
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:37,134
It can tie in through the front end

52
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:40,750
applications, it can talk through the various integrations on

53
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,362
cloud, on social and other things, and it can establish

54
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:48,726
really a good observability where it

55
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:52,262
will provide the end to end visibility on

56
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,666
the transactions on the type of business functions

57
00:03:55,698 --> 00:04:00,010
that need to be successful. Now what is this business architecture approach?

58
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,842
I would like to share with you business

59
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:08,730
architecture approach where you can see there are

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,862
three levels to it. One is the

61
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:16,302
dev and QA production environments where we have

62
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,414
various engineering teams working. Whether we have DevOps teams, we have

63
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:23,682
QA teams, SRE teams. Then the second

64
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:27,426
level is on the events, the events level which

65
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:30,590
is this all is generating lot of events.

66
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,846
Where events are on application logs, traces events,

67
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:38,802
SRE on networks, events on threats, external internal

68
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,834
events, on incidents, happen, problems. We have storage

69
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,720
data, we have other user experience data.

70
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,262
All this is becoming a lot of events to be captured

71
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:54,010
and correlated properly. Now there are

72
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,754
tools available which can do this and right from the

73
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,614
open telemetry and other things. But the key here is

74
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:05,262
also that how do we establish the end to end

75
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:08,714
business observability now end to end business observability,

76
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:12,138
what it means it has broadly

77
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:16,114
end user experience. It has application performance, it has

78
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:19,406
infrastructure monitoring, it has security monitoring,

79
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:23,646
it has ITSm process performance, it has cloud monitoring.

80
00:05:23,838 --> 00:05:27,430
Now what is happening here is there SRE

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,760
business processes running when we say procure to pay

82
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,634
or similar on business process. Then there are various applications tied

83
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:39,194
on it. But these applications do not have end to end

84
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:43,260
business observability. What is required here is approach where

85
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,510
we can correlate the end user experience with performance,

86
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,134
with monitoring together and securities and

87
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:55,530
even the process performance and find out the process optimization opportunities.

88
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,520
We can find out from various cloud logs. We can find out

89
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,382
based on the type of optimization needed in the cloud environments.

90
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:08,194
So when we bring it together, it becomes really end

91
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:12,274
to end observability. And that observability is

92
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:16,550
required for the various target

93
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,806
departments and organizations and teams. And some of that

94
00:06:20,908 --> 00:06:24,914
we have listed here, there is the head of DevOps, there are ITSM

95
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:28,282
teams, SRE teams, the network operations teams, the cloud

96
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:32,282
monitoring team and many more. Now what is

97
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:35,514
unique here. Now what is unique here is that

98
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:40,090
two factors are there. One, we do a Persona based observability,

99
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,966
that is a custom Persona based where it can takes the

100
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:47,582
end to end business observability and then it can also

101
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:50,942
have automated self feelings. Now once

102
00:06:50,996 --> 00:06:54,434
this architecture is set up, then it gives you lot

103
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:58,258
of patterns, lot of insights which can be used to

104
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:01,758
plan automation, whether you can do partial automation,

105
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:05,842
self healing, but really a planning can be done. Now this

106
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:09,926
planning can be used while on the systems, or there can

107
00:07:09,948 --> 00:07:14,166
be a process which the SRE engineers can run on it when there

108
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:16,680
is a normal anomaly or event happens.

109
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,062
Now this all is giving rise to a good architecture

110
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:25,062
which can be used while setup of the overall platforms

111
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:28,666
and the benefits of using this is there

112
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:32,382
will be easy usage of AIML on this because

113
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:36,926
the data will be collected across logs, traces metrics across

114
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:40,526
together and when an incident happens, whether it's a security

115
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:44,530
incident or a performance problem on application or something

116
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,740
happened on the cloud environments, there can be a deep correlation available

117
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,386
and we also want to encourage that there

118
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:56,342
SRE business process automations also where we can use the

119
00:07:56,396 --> 00:08:00,246
business processes to find out various points

120
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:04,134
where the value stream can be improved and then the

121
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:07,974
real KPIs and metrics can be tied in and

122
00:08:08,092 --> 00:08:11,430
the type of slas which are to be met for the given

123
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,822
applications can be met appropriately and

124
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:18,434
various collaborations of other teams

125
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:21,962
can happen and there can be a shared impact

126
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:25,646
and prioritization view that what is happening

127
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:29,246
less optimal or what is wrong in the systems and

128
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:32,670
which business process is getting impacted.

129
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:35,680
This is what I wanted to present to you today.

130
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,260
Thanks for joining in.
