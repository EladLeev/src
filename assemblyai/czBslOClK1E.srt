1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,790
You. Hi and welcome

2
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,594
to my presentation about the digital factory,

3
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:37,350
how we can industrialize our product development.

4
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,470
First to myself, my name is Romano Roth and

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,762
I am chief chief of DevOps and partner partner

6
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:49,838
at Zirke. I work now since 21 years

7
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:53,694
at Tilke. I joined Tilke directly after

8
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:57,402
university, became a junior

9
00:00:57,546 --> 00:01:01,706
net engineer, then an advanced software engineer, then an expert

10
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:05,998
software engineer, then a lead software architect, and then a consultant.

11
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:09,634
And one thing that was always at my heart

12
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:13,346
is how can we continuously deliver value? How can

13
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:16,502
we ensure the quality of what we are

14
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:20,710
building, and how can we automate things?

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,530
And when the whole DevOps movement started, I jumped

16
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,554
right on top of that, became one of the organizers of

17
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:32,294
the DevOps Meetup Zurich, which is a monthly meetup

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,754
we are doing in person in Zurich. And you can always

19
00:01:35,872 --> 00:01:39,446
join us, it's completely free. And I'm

20
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,990
also one of the organizers of the DevOps days

21
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,506
Zurich. The DevOps days is a global movement.

22
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:50,014
In all of the big cities all around the world,

23
00:01:50,132 --> 00:01:53,506
there are DevOps days. And I'm the president

24
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:57,330
of the DevOps Days Zurich. And you can see

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,314
DevOps is really a topic that lies at my heart.

26
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:05,234
And that's also why I have my own YouTube

27
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:09,222
channel with over 100 videos all around

28
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:14,070
DevOps platform, engineering, architecture and leadership.

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,574
And I'm also posting quite

30
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:21,402
a lot and tweeting quite a lot. You can always follow

31
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:25,334
me on all of the social media channels

32
00:02:25,382 --> 00:02:29,498
that you see there. When you want to learn more about

33
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:32,926
DevOps in the products that

34
00:02:32,948 --> 00:02:36,334
I'm doing, I work for different clients in

35
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:40,110
different industries and I do DevOps transformation.

36
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,422
Now when I'm at such DevOps transformation,

37
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,642
or when I go to the clients, then I

38
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:52,180
see the following picture, which you can see here.

39
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,342
The business together with the clients, they have great

40
00:02:56,396 --> 00:03:00,274
plans. They are putting these great plans

41
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:04,374
into ideas and they put that into

42
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:08,082
word documents and into gyra tickets.

43
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:11,950
And then they throw these word documents and chira

44
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,386
tickets over the wall of confusion to the development team.

45
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:18,790
The development team looks at these documents

46
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,334
and they say, yeah, if you want to have that, we can

47
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:25,838
implement that. And they implement it and then

48
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:29,118
they throw it over the wall of confusion to the testing team.

49
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:33,510
The testing team looks at that, what got delivered

50
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,666
and looks at the specification, and it

51
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:41,282
is not the same, but they test something, it's green,

52
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:45,090
and they throw it over the wall of confusion to the operation team.

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,854
The operation team said, how should we

54
00:03:48,892 --> 00:03:52,786
operate that? That will never ever work in production.

55
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:56,534
But of course, somehow they get it to

56
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:59,786
work and it goes back to the customer and to the business.

57
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:03,530
And they say, hey, what is that? That's not

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,210
what we wanted. This is not usable.

59
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,534
And what you can see here is actually this

60
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:14,634
infinity symbol. This is a value stream.

61
00:04:14,762 --> 00:04:18,506
And in that value stream you see all of these walls

62
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:21,674
of confusion. And these walls of confusion,

63
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:25,970
they are coming from the silo organization, which we find

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,762
in many companies. So the value stream, the value

65
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:33,346
flow is broken by these walls of

66
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:37,590
confusion. You also can see that there is no alignment.

67
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,762
These different organizations, they don't work at the same goals.

68
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:47,570
And overall there is a very bad developer experience

69
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,658
and a complete lack of excellence, also of

70
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:54,090
software engineering excellence.

71
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,926
Now there is this big movement of DevOps,

72
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:01,838
where you put the client into center, you stop

73
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:06,554
using projects, you go into product development.

74
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:09,706
So you have products instead of projects,

75
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:13,522
and you continuously deliver value across the

76
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:17,106
value stream. So DevOps is a mindset and a culture and

77
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:21,694
a set of technical practices which allows you to continuously

78
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,926
deliver value or the products to

79
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:29,042
your customer. So when we talk about DevOps,

80
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:33,094
then we also need to talk about that term, DevOps, because that

81
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,854
term DevOps is not so well chosen. It says

82
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:40,634
development and operation. And of

83
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:43,258
course there are some people,

84
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:47,958
smart people out there, they say, yeah, we need to fix that term, because nowadays

85
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:52,262
security is very important. So let's call it devsecops,

86
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:55,206
which is development, security and operation.

87
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:59,054
And others say, no, we need to call it

88
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,782
Bisdev ops because the business is a very, very important,

89
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:06,446
they are giving us the money. So BisdevOps business development

90
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,242
and operation is the right term. And you can see this

91
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:14,258
discussion does not go everywhere, because as I mentioned

92
00:06:14,344 --> 00:06:18,166
before, it is about organizing across the

93
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:22,470
value stream, bringing all the people together which work on

94
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,530
a product. So we should need a term

95
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,766
like Dev, Sec bits, Arc,

96
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,902
user experience, quality assurance,

97
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:36,902
Ops. Or we just call it DevOps,

98
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:40,570
because DevOps is about bringing

99
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,062
all the people, process and technology together to

100
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:47,802
continuously deliver value. This is what DevOps

101
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,920
is at its heart.

102
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,350
So what does that DevOps bring us?

103
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,586
So science has looked at that, there is this

104
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:02,594
state of DevOps report and the amazing book accelerate which

105
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:06,182
had a look from a scientific perspective to

106
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:09,814
DevOps. And they are comparing companies which are not

107
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:13,314
doing DevOps versus companies which are doing DevOps.

108
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:17,320
And you can see the benefits are huge. For example,

109
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,466
you have a 973 lives,

110
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:25,034
increased deployment frequency. So how many deployments you can

111
00:07:25,072 --> 00:07:28,454
do also faster lead times into production,

112
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,870
faster time to discovery, and you have

113
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,174
a much lower change failure rate. When you summarize all

114
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:39,406
of that, then you can clearly say when you are

115
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:42,754
doing DevOps the benefits are you get more

116
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:45,970
value for the money, a faster time to market,

117
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,774
a better quality, a higher customer satisfaction

118
00:07:49,822 --> 00:07:52,494
and top qualified employees.

119
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:56,466
This is the benefits of DevOps.

120
00:07:56,658 --> 00:08:00,454
So now we have understood what DevOps is,

121
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:04,678
but doing DevOps is already quite

122
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:08,662
difficult. Scaling DevOps

123
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:12,026
is even more difficult. Let's have a look how

124
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:15,482
we scale that. So usually what we

125
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:20,662
see in companies is this picture. You have different development

126
00:08:20,726 --> 00:08:24,318
teams and then you have the wall of computation and then

127
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:27,806
different Ops teams. And many companies

128
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:31,914
try to fix that by establishing a DevOps

129
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:35,522
team in the middle. While this is sort

130
00:08:35,576 --> 00:08:38,994
of an okay start point,

131
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:42,386
it is not a real solution to the

132
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:46,438
problem, because with that you are just introducing another

133
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:50,034
silo and you are not organizing

134
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:54,182
yourself across the value stream and bringing all the people together

135
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:58,142
to work on a product. So it's just another silo.

136
00:08:58,306 --> 00:09:02,460
But of course it can be a starting point.

137
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,206
Now, how does DevOps look like when you are doing DevOps?

138
00:09:07,318 --> 00:09:11,178
Then you will have such a picture where you bring all the people together,

139
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:14,574
not only dev and Ops as you see it here. So there will

140
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:18,702
be all of the people which are working together in

141
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:22,474
product teams. But this

142
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:26,482
is also not the silver bullet, because with that you are

143
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:30,162
introducing quite some inconsistencies and some

144
00:09:30,216 --> 00:09:33,730
redundancies. And you also can see

145
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,734
that many of these teams, they are lacking product or

146
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:41,222
operation experience. And of course there is also that

147
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:44,818
complexity, for example of the toolings

148
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:48,786
of the cloud and everything. So there is quite

149
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:52,746
a lot of cognitive load on these teams. Let's have a

150
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:56,138
quick look on the tooling. You may have heard

151
00:09:56,224 --> 00:10:00,006
of the term CI CD, which is continuous integration and

152
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:04,910
continuous deployment or delivery. And usually

153
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,926
what I also say is this is not enough because

154
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,050
what you have in front is you have the continuous exploration

155
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,306
where you are doing the requirements, engineering, the ideation and

156
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,826
all of that, the backlog management. And in the end you also have

157
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:23,534
the release on demand where you are continuously deploying

158
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,850
and switching on and off features.

159
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,210
So the whole thing is called continuous

160
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,606
delivery pipeline. And here you see just an

161
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:36,594
example of such a continuous delivery pipeline.

162
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:40,586
It's really an example of what kind of tools you have in

163
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:44,202
there. But what you can see is you need to

164
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:48,202
integrate all of these tools together and you also

165
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:51,950
need to maintain all of these tools. And when you have

166
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,082
DevOps teams, they need to maintain

167
00:10:55,146 --> 00:10:59,194
that there. They need to maintain their continuous delivery

168
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,946
pipeline. Of course, there are big vendors out

169
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:06,420
there which say, hey, we got you

170
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,126
GitLab, GitHub or Azure

171
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:13,586
DevOps and other vendors are out there

172
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:17,286
which say, yeah, we have that DevOps platform

173
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:20,534
for you where we can

174
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:24,550
cover everything. When you take a closer look you will see,

175
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,720
yeah, they have a platform,

176
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,594
but still you need to integrate quite a lot

177
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:35,066
of tools in there. And also they

178
00:11:35,088 --> 00:11:39,762
are promising that they have everything, but in the end they are also integrating

179
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:43,950
some other third party tools into that and you still

180
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,178
need to maintain, of course the integration

181
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:50,526
is quite good and everything is okay.

182
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:55,090
Nevertheless, you need to understand these platforms.

183
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,054
Now you have recognized that DevOps

184
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:03,646
is a mindset, a culture and a set of technical practices.

185
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:07,654
It's not only about tools, it's also about

186
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:11,174
these technical practices. And here I

187
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:14,534
show you in this DevOps cycle what that

188
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:18,074
means, these technical practices. So if you want to

189
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,622
build great products, if you want to do modern software

190
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:25,082
development, then you need to

191
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:29,114
implement these technical practices in

192
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:32,894
order to continuously deliver value and

193
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:36,606
build in quality. Of course you don't need to implement all of

194
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:40,334
that, but some of them need to be

195
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:43,906
implemented when you want to build great

196
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:47,570
products. And what you also can see

197
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,978
is, and especially when for example I

198
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:54,580
join different clients, what I see is

199
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,902
when a new team member or when I join a team,

200
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:03,046
the onboarding takes quite a lot of time until I have

201
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:06,230
really access to all of the environments,

202
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,186
to the source code, to the repository, to the

203
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,998
CI CD pipeline, to the Kubernetes cluster,

204
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:16,780
it takes weeks and even months.

205
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,314
And then when I want to have for example a new Kubernetes cluster,

206
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:24,942
new VM or a new database, it again

207
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:29,578
takes quite a lot of time until it gets provisioned

208
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:33,634
for me. And also when I got it,

209
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:38,034
usually I need to configure it according to

210
00:13:38,232 --> 00:13:42,226
words document or a gyro ticket. And when

211
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:46,086
it comes to devsecops, doing devsecops, identifying all

212
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:49,670
of these vulnerabilities, this is also quite a huge

213
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,954
topic. When you enable vulnerability scanner

214
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:58,058
license compliance, scanner software composition analysis or

215
00:13:58,144 --> 00:14:01,642
SAS, you get a lot of

216
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:05,034
vulnerabilities and you need to make sense out

217
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:08,618
of that. In the end, what you can see in

218
00:14:08,704 --> 00:14:12,298
most of the product development or the projects,

219
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,754
you have a bad time to productivity, a slow

220
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:19,930
time to market and low quality and no standards.

221
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,620
So this is quite bad.

222
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,900
Can you at all scale DevOps? Is that really something

223
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,994
that is possible? For that we

224
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:36,374
need to make a step back and think about

225
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:39,800
what do we want or what

226
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,502
does our company want. And I'm bringing now

227
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:48,714
you a picture which I will build up so that you

228
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:51,980
understand what we really want.

229
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:56,710
On the top level you have the board, the board of directors,

230
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,122
the management and what they

231
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:03,742
have, they have a clear vision where they want to go with

232
00:15:03,796 --> 00:15:07,422
the company. So, for example, in this example here,

233
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:11,566
you have a drone, you have a small market share and

234
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:15,182
you want to have more market share. In the end, you want to earn more

235
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:18,754
money and get bigger. So potentially you want

236
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,514
to have more drones. When you only have software products, it's the same.

237
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:26,002
You have a small application and you want to have more application or

238
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:30,054
a bigger market share. So what does these

239
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:33,846
people do? They are the portfolio level. There you

240
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:36,738
have the portfolio of all the big initiatives.

241
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:41,014
They have a portfolio backlog, and in the portfolio backlog,

242
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:44,966
there are all of these bright ideas,

243
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:49,078
and now they will choose the most promising

244
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:52,574
bright idea and give that down to the

245
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:56,190
product level where the product managers are.

246
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,640
So in this example here, you see the

247
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,674
board of directors, they have chosen that

248
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:08,494
they want to build a drone which can lift heavy

249
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:12,162
weights. So that's the idea. It's not yet a product

250
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:16,274
around that. And they give it down to the product managers

251
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:20,854
to sketch it out. What do we need to

252
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:24,194
make? Sort of a drone which lifts

253
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:27,878
heavy weights. So they give that down and the product

254
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:32,010
managers, they will have a look at that and they will

255
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,634
extract the features out of it,

256
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:38,742
which you need to build. For example, a drone

257
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:42,414
which can do the heavy lifting in software, it would

258
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:45,898
be the same. Perhaps you want to have an additional software,

259
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:48,814
additional feature and you would give that,

260
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:52,158
again, down. So on the product level,

261
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,518
you have the product backlog, where all of these features

262
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:58,770
are in, and these features are then broken down

263
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,530
into user stories, which you give down to

264
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,210
the team level. And of course, they are all discussing

265
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,878
these things. They are working very closely together.

266
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:13,782
You always have feedback cycles from

267
00:17:13,836 --> 00:17:17,014
the top to the bottom. But in the end,

268
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:21,146
you have teams, perhaps already working teams, and you

269
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:24,906
give these user stories down there. They are going on

270
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:28,454
the team backlog, and the teams are continuously

271
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:32,606
working on these user stories. And of

272
00:17:32,628 --> 00:17:36,686
course, because you are now creating perhaps something special,

273
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:40,606
like here, you perhaps also need a new team

274
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:44,274
in order to create that. And this is where

275
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:48,194
the platform engineering comes into play, which builds the

276
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:51,522
platform for these teams. The teams are

277
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:55,466
owning their own platform, but the platform engineers,

278
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:59,186
they are providing these platforms

279
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:02,914
to the teams so that they can work efficiently

280
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,934
on these platforms. Here in this example, we will

281
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,614
create a new team with their new CI

282
00:18:10,662 --> 00:18:14,506
CD pipeline. In the end, all of the parts are

283
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:18,074
coming together, are getting assembled and it

284
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:21,280
will be shipped to the customer

285
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,742
and the customer will be, of course, happy about that.

286
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:29,534
But the most important thing is now we

287
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:33,262
have implemented the first step, we deliver

288
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:36,260
value very fast to the customer.

289
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,994
Now what we need to do is we need to get

290
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:44,594
feedback from the customer and we

291
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:48,118
need to make sense out of that. And it's not only customer

292
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:53,080
feedback, it's also the whole telemetry about how

293
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,762
our application is working so that we can again give feedback

294
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:01,770
also to the teams. And you see that in there, feedback goes

295
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,398
everywhere. It not only goes to the teams,

296
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:08,826
to the product level, it also goes to

297
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,614
the portfolio level, to the board,

298
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:16,414
because they had an idea, an idea

299
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:20,894
has hypothesis, and now they

300
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:24,606
can evaluate if this hypothesis

301
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:28,626
is true or false, if they want to invest more money

302
00:19:28,728 --> 00:19:32,194
into this idea, or if they want to

303
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:36,262
stop investing money in this idea and build

304
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:40,166
something else. And what you see here is

305
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:43,798
exactly a digital factory. And this is

306
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:47,320
what most companies want to have.

307
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,966
Talking about this platform engineering,

308
00:19:51,078 --> 00:19:54,794
I think here we need to dive a little bit deeper so that

309
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:59,894
you get a better understanding, because the

310
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:03,454
platform engineering is the foundation of the

311
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:07,838
digital factory. So in the end, what you want to have

312
00:20:07,924 --> 00:20:11,630
is you want to have product teams which take

313
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,978
care about a product. They build it and they

314
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:19,506
run it. So the whole operation is within them.

315
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:23,506
In the middle you have the platform team. But bear with me,

316
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:27,122
this is not a silo organization

317
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:30,978
which you have, and you again have walls of confusion.

318
00:20:31,154 --> 00:20:35,382
No, they are building a product which

319
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:38,698
the product development team can

320
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:42,502
use. And the point lies

321
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:45,754
on can. They don't need to use it,

322
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:49,178
they can use it. They need to

323
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,910
love that product. Let me give you another

324
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,478
picture about that. You see, the platform team

325
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:59,998
builds the platform and the platform can be different

326
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:03,454
things. It can include API gateways,

327
00:21:03,582 --> 00:21:07,282
CI CD pipelines, repositories, synthetic test data,

328
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:10,882
kubernetes cluster, and so on and so on. So really the

329
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,782
platform where the products of the product

330
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:18,982
teams can be built upon that.

331
00:21:19,116 --> 00:21:22,534
So the platform teams, they develop,

332
00:21:22,652 --> 00:21:26,342
build and maintain the whole platform. So they

333
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:30,970
are generating value for the product teams.

334
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,938
The product teams, they generate value for

335
00:21:35,024 --> 00:21:38,506
the customer. So the platform team,

336
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:42,030
they are enabling the teams to do

337
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,486
DevOps, because the platform teams will build

338
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:49,630
and run and maintain their products using

339
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,650
that platform. And here again, it's very important,

340
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,154
they need to love the platform. So the platform

341
00:21:57,272 --> 00:22:00,990
itself is a product and you should never force

342
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,180
the teams to use this platform.

343
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,230
They need to want to use your

344
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,640
platform. That's the approach you want to follow.

345
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,638
But platform engineering is not the only thing

346
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:19,674
you need to do. You really need to look at

347
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:23,114
the digital factory from a holistic point

348
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:27,046
of view. Because when you want to deliver complex

349
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:30,554
products. This always requires a holistic

350
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:34,574
approach. And it's not only about that platform engineering which

351
00:22:34,612 --> 00:22:38,286
you have in the DevOps part, where you have the

352
00:22:38,308 --> 00:22:42,058
platform, the CI CD pipelines, the platform engineering,

353
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:45,714
also all of the practices. You also need to

354
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:49,182
have the right architecture to ensure

355
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:52,354
the scalability of what you are building. You need

356
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:57,014
to have the quality standards and also the

357
00:22:57,052 --> 00:23:00,614
APIs. But not only that, you also need to

358
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:04,854
have the data because you want to make

359
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:08,950
something out of the data. You want to have effective

360
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,306
data pipelines, you want to use the data.

361
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:17,370
So in order that you can make the right decisions.

362
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:21,134
And this leads us to customer experience only

363
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:24,718
with the right data you can have a great customer experience.

364
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:28,394
Because customer experience is all about gathering

365
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:32,534
feedback from the market, from your clients, and ensuring

366
00:23:32,682 --> 00:23:37,140
that you have a great end to end customer experience

367
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,074
and to continuously deliver. You need

368
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:45,266
to have an agile program delivery where you

369
00:23:45,288 --> 00:23:49,014
have the different teams and how they are working with each

370
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,406
other, backlog management and all of that. And on

371
00:23:52,428 --> 00:23:55,970
top of that, you need to have the product management

372
00:23:56,050 --> 00:24:00,026
where you connect the strategy with the

373
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:03,434
execution. So all of that is

374
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:07,050
needed to build a digital factory.

375
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,118
As you can see, the platform engineering which

376
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:15,278
this conference is all about, is about building

377
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:19,290
that foundation of a digital factory

378
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,242
which enables their teams

379
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:27,214
to do DevOps. And as you can see,

380
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:32,042
this is how we are entering the age of industrialization

381
00:24:32,186 --> 00:24:35,380
in software development. Thank you very much.
