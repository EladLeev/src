00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,654
Good morning, good afternoon and welcome to today's session on seamless customer service with

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,762
Amazon Connect and Alexa, where we will dive how AI ML

3
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:33,298
could help to improve the customer experience and how to perform data driven

4
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:37,154
and personalized customer services. My name Asif Mujawar. I'm a senior dev specialist,

5
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:41,126
SA best of London with AWS, working with customers across the

6
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:45,162
globe, helping build next gen data based platform and transforming application

7
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:48,794
in the cloud using AI and ML. So, a couple

8
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:52,814
of key takeaways from this session. Today we will discover chat

9
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,154
is Amazon Connect. We will look into what are the ML

10
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:59,466
services we have in AWS, how to utilize

11
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:02,986
these services with Amazon Connect, and how to integrate Amazon

12
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:06,466
Neptune for data driven decisions on Amazon Connect. Now,

13
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:10,018
Amazon Neptune is our graph database service which has

14
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:14,114
ML becked into it. So that will help us to do

15
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:18,066
the data driven decisions when it comes through databases or relationship mapping,

16
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:21,910
or prediction of some of the relations chat

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,334
we could build in the background for the customer data and how we can

18
00:01:25,372 --> 00:01:29,126
use this data in Amazon Connect. So let's just dive into

19
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:32,426
a bit more about what is Amazon Connect? So I'm going to share a

20
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:35,706
bit of the origin story with you around how AWS came to

21
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,494
market with a simple to use omnichannel cloud contact center offering

22
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:42,586
and why we believe that we have the best solution.

23
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:45,854
We'll talk about why customers are adopting connect so quickly,

24
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,694
the experiences they are creating and the benefits they are

25
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:53,070
seeing. But the journey doesn't start here. So I would actually

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,802
like to tell you about the story behind the story. For that,

27
00:01:56,856 --> 00:02:00,334
we'll have to go back twelve years. So at Amazon,

28
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:04,194
we strive to be Earth's most customer centric company. And to do this, everyone who

29
00:02:04,232 --> 00:02:07,554
works at Amazon understands that our customers are our top priority

30
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:11,794
and that our future as a company is built on customer satisfaction.

31
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:15,874
Twelve years ago, Amazon Retail was starting to see the enormous

32
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:19,494
hockey stick growth. More products than ever, more customers than

33
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:22,998
ever. And to be able to really focus on ensuring highest possible levels

34
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:27,078
of customer satisfaction, we needed the right people and right processes.

35
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:30,614
But we also needed the contact center technology that

36
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:34,154
was capable of ensuring customer satisfaction at scale.

37
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:37,870
So today, over 70,000 Amazon customer Service

38
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,886
Associates supports millions of customers who speak

39
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:46,110
dozens of languages from customer service centers in 32 countries

40
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,474
across the globe. We knew that in order to scale to

41
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:53,134
this size and to deliver exceptional customer service at this call,

42
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:56,498
we would need the right technology in place. We knew the

43
00:02:56,504 --> 00:03:00,614
trajectory of growth we are seeing, but we also needed to center for

44
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:04,278
rapid changes in demand. Are you aware of Amazon Prime Day.

45
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:08,290
So as you can imagine, on Prime Day, there is significant increase

46
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,866
in traffic to the online store as well as traffic to

47
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:15,370
the custom service centers. The contact center technology need to be able to take

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,986
thousands of additional agents to handle this peak moment and

49
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:22,262
scale back down literally a day later. So we explored

50
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:25,374
a lot of contact center solutions, what we have on the market, on chat

51
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:28,782
time, and we went through evolution about the product

52
00:03:28,836 --> 00:03:32,238
which can be customizable, can it scale and

53
00:03:32,324 --> 00:03:36,354
few other bits and bobs. But what we realized that the

54
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:39,390
products on the market either they were good at scaling,

55
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,866
bot not so good at customization. The products which were good

56
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:46,702
at customization, they weren't good at scaling. So we needed

57
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:51,250
to have something that can be customizable, that can be scaled

58
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,126
and to do what we had as a region, so what we

59
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:58,102
did, so we built our own service as a contact center.

60
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:02,298
As a service using our knowledge and experience, we built an easy to use,

61
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:05,834
intuitive system that enables Amazon customer service associates to

62
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:10,230
focus their attention on the customer rather than navigating

63
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,010
a complex or difficult to use system and their supervisors.

64
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,130
A simple tool for managing their staff and their businesses.

65
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,150
Over 50 groups and businesses within Amazon and its subsidiaries provide

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,670
customer service today, including Zappos, audible and of course,

67
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,834
Amazon Retail, the customer service which alone has

68
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,138
hundred global contact centers and over 70,000 agents,

69
00:04:31,224 --> 00:04:35,162
making Amazon Connect suitable for contact centers ranging from tens

70
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:39,798
of agents to tens of thousands of agents over time. Our AWS customer

71
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:43,378
would meet our ex CEO Andy Jassie

72
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:47,174
and ask him, what technology are you using for

73
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:50,626
your contact center at Amazon? And he would tell them it's

74
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:54,426
an internal tool and they would respond, if you bring that to the

75
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:57,642
market, we would be interested in that. And we saw this again

76
00:04:57,696 --> 00:05:01,674
and again. Andy funded a team to bring our internal tool to the market,

77
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:05,214
which we did in March 2017 as Amazon Connect.

78
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:09,486
So Amazon Connect is a simple to use, cloud based contact center service we

79
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:13,326
brought to the market to enable businesses to deliver exceptional omnichannel

80
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:17,070
customer experiences that are natural, dynamic and personalized.

81
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,754
It includes call the standard functionality contact center operations team have

82
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:24,014
come to expect skill based routing maximizes

83
00:05:24,062 --> 00:05:27,470
efficiency of agents and satisfaction of end customers. To ensure

84
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,438
that connect to the right customer of the right agent at the right time,

85
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:34,054
voice and chat interactions are recorded making it easy to monitor and improve the agent

86
00:05:34,092 --> 00:05:37,782
quality call the common reporting analytics is available. Our customer

87
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:41,254
often tell us how much they love the audio broadband Internet

88
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:45,286
connection or the audio quality for calls with Amazon

89
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:48,714
Connect using a standard broadband Internet connection, agents can be

90
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:51,982
located virtually anywhere. Empowering businesses to offer

91
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:56,238
increased flexibility to work at home agents. So in a current pandemic situation,

92
00:05:56,404 --> 00:06:00,174
imagine everybody's working from home. So the

93
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:03,886
traditional offerings, what we had wouldn't have allow us to do the scale

94
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:07,746
at the level we wanted to scale and connect using

95
00:06:07,848 --> 00:06:11,460
the cloud native system call you need is

96
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,758
a hardware and a USB headset to connect with and that's

97
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:19,174
about it. We built this from the ground to take advantage of the cloud built

98
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,870
as multi tenant architected service that is available around

99
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,386
the world through low latency links. We also have created a network

100
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:30,042
of managed carriers for easy telephony hosting. At the same time,

101
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:33,526
we utilize online powerful AI ML AWS

102
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:37,722
services to help improve your customer journey within

103
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:41,470
your contact center using Amazon Connect. So let's just dive into

104
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,434
the first demo of how Amazon Connect helps

105
00:06:45,482 --> 00:06:48,666
you improve your customer journey. So in this demo we'll

106
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:51,626
see a customer interacting with Alexa,

107
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:55,466
which is another device where customer interacts with.

108
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:59,266
And then in the back end, what we do. We have used an

109
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:02,574
AI powered Amazon Lex natural language processing

110
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:06,238
bot to serve the customer. So we're not pushing the calls directly

111
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:10,066
to the customer agents on your contact center. What we're doing, we're reducing

112
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:13,474
that impact on the agents and we're addressing most frequently

113
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:17,254
asked questions and most commonly asked questions and serving them via this

114
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:21,158
AI bot technology, Amazon Lex and what this Lex

115
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:24,998
technology uses in the background, another AI service called Amazon Kendra,

116
00:07:25,094 --> 00:07:28,394
which then goes in and scans your knowledge base and

117
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:31,838
pulls that information. What needs to be served to the customer on a

118
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:34,926
frequently asked question or most commonly asked questions? And we filter the

119
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:38,960
traffic from customers to your contact center.

120
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,386
Only the customers will actually need some assistance on technical whereas

121
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:46,946
how do I do something which is a common, like how do I top up

122
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:50,066
my phone or how do I change my address? All of these

123
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:53,710
things can then be services via natural language processing bot.

124
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:57,218
So that gives you that ability to reduce the

125
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:00,438
impact on the network, on your contact center. Plus at

126
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:03,686
the same time it improves your customer experience that I don't have to

127
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:07,638
wait in the queues and chat, I know I have to understand, answer the

128
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:11,878
questions to another agent, what I've already addressed on the IBR,

129
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,398
and that way the whole architecture, which we'll

130
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:19,002
look in insider two, has baked in to improve that customer experience. So without

131
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:20,720
further ado, let's have a look.

132
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,840
Alexa open Cox Customer service

133
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,486

the problem with your wiFi? You can ask me any questions regarding

by text, by phone or in a shop. You can also

145
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:23,150
top up someone else's phone online. Please visit HTTPs

146
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,340
mycox.com. I would like to speak to an agent.

147
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:37,320
Thanks for using our service. You will receive a call on 412-965-9834

148
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,566
so you can see here the customer interacting with Alexa at

149
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:46,166
their home, on their phone device or eco dot. And in

150
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:49,750
the background we use the Amazon Alexa NLP bot to

151
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,046
process the customer through custom security checks where we ask

152
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:56,586
for phone number and the digits and we verify the customer. You can see

153
00:09:56,608 --> 00:10:00,074
how we personalize the customer asking do you still have

154
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:03,498
the problem which they reported last time? Again, this AI

155
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:07,326
is built in. Our service in the background is

156
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:10,782
picking up the last interaction and last interaction category and asking

157
00:10:10,836 --> 00:10:14,190
that customer a question whether they had the problem. At the same time,

158
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,786
we dive into the for frequently asked questions. As customer asks,

159
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,466
how do I talk with my phone? So we scan the knowledge base and we

160
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:23,954
present the information back to the customer. And if the customer wants

161
00:10:23,992 --> 00:10:27,314
to speak to an agent, we seamlessly transfer this customer to

162
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:31,240
an agent. Now let's look at how does that conversation goes on.

163
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,166
So here we have the call coming in from the customer, and this is the

164
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:39,206
customer agent side looking at it. And as you can see, we have

165
00:10:39,228 --> 00:10:43,046
the attributes populated where we are saying the channels underscore

166
00:10:43,078 --> 00:10:47,098
regular handler, queue and churn prediction, which is another ML we

167
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,580
have applied. But we'll talk about in a second or two.

168
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,628
Hello there. Yes, how are you? How are you?

169
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:02,596
Everything going well? Excellent, yes, can't complain. So how can

170
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:06,276
I help you today, ma'am? I was wondering,

171
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:10,356
what will my monthly phone bill include? What will your monthly

172
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,730
phone bill will include? Let's have a look.

173
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,104
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:14,142 --> 00:11:21,960
Pleased.

175
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,630
Yeah, while it's coming through, how's your day been so far?

176
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,856
Oh, it's been okay. It's been okay. I'm trying to catch up

177
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:38,256
on some stuff. I have a kid in college and

178
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:40,770
I'm just trying to figure things out.

179
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,296
By the way, your Alexa app is super helpful.

180
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:49,616
I'm glad it helped you. Right. So your monthly

181
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:52,948
phone bill will cover the cost of your plan and additional services

182
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:56,664
such as additional add ons or any part charges such

183
00:11:56,702 --> 00:12:00,184
as devices or accessory channels and third

184
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:03,928
party charges. If you need more information please visit our website call

185
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,356
which is httpsmycox.com. I hope that

186
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:10,908
helps you. That definitely does. Thank you

187
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:14,668
so very much. I appreciate it and

188
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:17,996
you have a great day. You too can. Thanks for calling.

189
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:21,532
Brilliant. So we just looked at it in the first part. We had the customer

190
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:25,104
interacting with Alexa. He started them Alexa. Then he came over

191
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:28,816
to an agent to speak to where a customer doesn't have to make

192
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:32,224
a call. Customer just simply provided the validation and

193
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:35,476
the Amazon connect. Then you utilize chat information and made an

194
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:38,816
outbound call. So at no point customer had to repeat

195
00:12:38,848 --> 00:12:42,580
itself and everything just was handed over to the agent.

196
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,908
Agent looked at it. Again we provided if you look at

197
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:49,764
the way we scan the knowledge base again, using an AI service in the background,

198
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:53,000
Amazon Kendra is able to provide that information to agents

199
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,124
where customer asks question what will my monthly phone bill will include

200
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:00,644
having an agent scamper through a lot of portals to get

201
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:04,556
information. We have one stop shop, he just punch in or she just punch in

202
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:07,996
the question in the search bar and click search and

203
00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:12,028
that's it. It gives you that answer. What it needs. Again, Amazon Kendra is a

204
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:15,328
natural language processing query engine. What we have in the

205
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:18,640
background, which is picking up this information presenting back to the customer.

206
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,432
So let's just dive into the architecture in this demo. So without

207
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:25,936
any coding or integration works, agents are presented with previous

208
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:29,204
chat messages from this interacting in line with the chat agent space.

209
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:32,596
This is both if a chat is transferred to another agent

210
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:36,196
or if the chat starts within the chat bot like it does in the demo,

211
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:39,976
meaning the customer does not have to repeat themselves and the agent is empowered to

212
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:43,624
start helping the customer immediately. So this is what it looks like under

213
00:13:43,662 --> 00:13:47,288
the hood, what we have used as an AI services

214
00:13:47,374 --> 00:13:50,488
or ML services in the background. So we have on the left hand side you

215
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:53,772
can see Alexa app user or customer can come in via phone call or customer

216
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:57,816
chat. If it's using Alexa app, then Alexa skill which is again powered

217
00:13:57,848 --> 00:14:01,260
by the NLP bot. So Alexa skill makes

218
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,464
that call to Amazon NLP Bot and we

219
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:07,744
use the outbound API call using a lambda, then we issue

220
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:11,696
the call to Amazon Connect. Within the connect we have contact flows which are taking

221
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:15,012
care of inbound and outbound connectivity, communication or also

222
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:18,944
the channels what we have the Alexa customer phone call or voice

223
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:22,436
or a chat channel. And within the center flow, then we do

224
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:26,784
interact with the multiple AI services using lambda. Then we predict

225
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:29,944
the customer churn and then we route the call based

226
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:32,952
on whether the customer is about to churn or not churn. If the churning customer

227
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:36,564
is coming in then we'll write the call to the agent who is handling

228
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:39,940
the churning call. Or if the customer sentiment is negative

229
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,548
then we wouldn't necessarily put through the IBR. We simply straight away put through

230
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:47,384
directly to an agent who can handle the negative sentiment customer who are specializing

231
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:51,260
that again that's an efficient routing and in terms of enabling the customer

232
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,676
to agent to help customers'questions. We have the NLP

233
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:59,184
query engine in the background which is Amazon Kendra which is another AI service

234
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:03,216
that can help you to better serve the customer from can

235
00:15:03,238 --> 00:15:06,836
agent point of view and that reduce the service time. So that's the

236
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:10,612
demo one let's look at. Let's just take this to a next level

237
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,276
where we establish another AI service to help us

238
00:15:14,378 --> 00:15:18,116
to drive the better customer experience. So what are

239
00:15:18,138 --> 00:15:21,832
the base business drivers for a top customer service and why? Customer service

240
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:25,176
is a key to a success of any business. Customer needs to

241
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,588
receive the right support at the right time from the customer services,

242
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:32,092
which means it in turn provide or

243
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:35,372
improve your customer satisfaction. And that means a happy

244
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:39,340
customer is more likely to recommend your business to the others and spend

245
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,152
more with your services. So how do we serve the customer right

246
00:15:43,206 --> 00:15:46,864
first time? So first of all, you need to know your customer, that is your

247
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:51,024
customer satisfaction from the previous interactions customer purchase history based

248
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:54,240
on how he's been sending or she has been spending with you.

249
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,180
The customer size itself chat are the customer needs based on the

250
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,984
products they have procured so far and what is the purchasing

251
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:05,604
power based on the history what we have. Secondly, you need

252
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:09,384
a system that enables the customer journey through the system more smoother and

253
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:13,464
effective. That is basically your interactive IVR can IVR with

254
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:16,932
natural language processing or aipowered bot in the background

255
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:20,664
which addresses the customer questions far more quickly than having to

256
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:24,076
solute everything to the customer agent. Secondly, you have

257
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:27,992
the ability to process the information on the fly, not necessarily

258
00:16:28,136 --> 00:16:32,144
putting the customer in the queue, process that information and then come back. Whereas you

259
00:16:32,182 --> 00:16:36,028
have that AI powered information processor in the background

260
00:16:36,124 --> 00:16:39,008
and ability to read the call to the right agent.

261
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:42,944
The third most thing, you need the right agent

262
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:45,780
for the right call. So how do you go about that? You need a system

263
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,764
to know which agent it should route the call based on some

264
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:53,716
criteria that enabled either the sales inquiry call to

265
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:57,476
convert in a purchase or returning customer call in a retention.

266
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:00,984
So how do we go about that? A routing system that

267
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:04,264
has AIML based in natively in that

268
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:07,784
service to be able to route this call based on some criteria.

269
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:11,180
So let's just define some criteria here. Say for example agent

270
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,488
CSAT score, so higher the agent CSAT score,

271
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:18,684
more likely that agent is convert that particular customer

272
00:17:18,802 --> 00:17:22,716
into sales or retain that customer if it's churning

273
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:26,192
customer. Secondly, the knowledge in that particular

274
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:30,256
product area for that agent, if the customer agent or

275
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:33,904
the agent itself is more like a technical support,

276
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:37,140
then he wouldn't necessarily will be able to do the sales support

277
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,468
call. So you need someone else in terms of

278
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:44,416
the agent specialties. Again, we can have this baked

279
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:48,152
in in the service that can look at the different

280
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:52,116
attributes of the agent and intelligently route

281
00:17:52,148 --> 00:17:55,528
the call to the right area, right customer call to the

282
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:59,216
right agent. And then thirdly look at the sales revenue attainment.

283
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,732
So for example, if your agent have

284
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:06,668
achieved the sales quota for that month, so it's less likely that particular

285
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:10,396
agent is going to go chat extra mile to

286
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:13,936
achieve that attainment what has been assigned to him or

287
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:17,568
her. So what system can do then simply can

288
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:21,424
look at on the fly who has hit the quota. So it's less

289
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:25,076
likely the call will be to that particular agent for the sales.

290
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:28,292
For the inquiries it will be go to the agent who

291
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:32,384
have got very high cs scroll, has product specialties and haven't achieved

292
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:35,524
the sales attainment. So that's a three dimensional

293
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:39,396
checks before the call is routed. So with this you're

294
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:43,064
increasing the probability that that inquiry is

295
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:46,312
going to be highly convertible in a sales.

296
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:50,216
So let's just look at how Amazon Eptune then helps

297
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:54,108
you build that relationship mapping between the right customer

298
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:57,596
to right agent. So for example, the demo which

299
00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:00,812
is coming up now, we will dive into what we just covered in the business

300
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:04,752
drivers to see this in action. How we pair the customer to the right agent

301
00:19:04,806 --> 00:19:08,816
and improve the customer experience. So potential new customer inquiries. So what

302
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:12,864
we do, we map the new customer based on the data we capture upfront in

303
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,732
possible two ways. First, have the best possible sales agent.

304
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:19,604
So first of all we capture the data in the flight in the IBR itself.

305
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:23,108
And then we will map the agent to the

306
00:19:23,114 --> 00:19:27,032
new customer based on best possible agent. And then we enable these agents

307
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:30,836
with some previous customer knowledge by mapping the new customer attributes

308
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:34,552
to an existing customer base which will help the agents to sell the right

309
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:38,136
product to their customer. This creates the unique experience for

310
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:41,916
both sides, for agent as well. AWS customer because agent knows what

311
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:45,628
the new customer looks like. Because we already have some historical knowledge based on the

312
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:49,456
existing customer, what we have collected and what these existing customers have

313
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:53,596
bought. So that means the agent is more likely to suggest

314
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:57,516
a product that suits the customer rather than having to guesswork.

315
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,250
And for the customer,

316
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,292
him or her got the right product or right services

317
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:07,684
from the company because they didn't know at the start bot.

318
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:10,816
Now with ability of creating that mapping

319
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:14,792
with existing customer base and having been able to establish that recommendation engine,

320
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:18,792
we have been able to services the customer right first

321
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:21,050
time. So let's just dive into the demo.

322
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,580
So here we have, as you can see, we have pulled the customer attributes.

323
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,676
Thank you for calling. How can I help you today? It looks like

324
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:37,260
you're looking for a 75 g package. Is that accurate?

325
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,140
Yeah, that's absolutely right. So I was just wondering,

326
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,784
trying to see if 75 g package is something I should

327
00:20:44,822 --> 00:20:48,336
be using and what's the rate and see if

328
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:51,552
that's something going to work for me. Absolutely.

329
00:20:51,686 --> 00:20:55,668
So let's talk about what is your average usage and what

330
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:59,184
do you see? I know most people don't calculate their usages,

331
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:02,548
but what do you see yourself using this for? Is this a personal

332
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:06,020
use or is this for a business use case?

333
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,796
It's a personal use. I normally work from home and I've

334
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:13,352
got two kids who are normally on their tabs watching

335
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:17,290
YouTube or whatever they want to watch it. So I'm just going to quickly

336
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,324
go onto the other side. What we did here,

337
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:25,160
we looked at how the customer agent was presented

338
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,036
with information that has came through and we saw when

339
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:32,188
the customer started interacting. Agent already have

340
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:36,144
most of the information about he wanted to buy the 75 gig package. He wanted

341
00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:39,836
to start tomorrow and likewise it dived into and converted

342
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:42,610
that sales inquiry into a sales.

343
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,460
So let's look at the next one where we're looking at retention scheme.

344
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,956
So here we're looking at this is an unhappy customer who is looking to

345
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:55,936
leave the service. Again, you can see, you will see in the agent panel.

346
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:59,352
We have provided enough information for the customer that will enable the agent

347
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:02,728
to better serve the customer, serve the churn customer.

348
00:22:02,814 --> 00:22:06,872
You can also see there are some offers being available

349
00:22:07,006 --> 00:22:11,212
or been prompted on the customer agent screen so

350
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:15,116
that customer agent could retain that particular customer.

351
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,952
At the same time, these offers which have come in on the fly

352
00:22:19,016 --> 00:22:22,288
are being calculated using the ML service in the background. Based on the

353
00:22:22,294 --> 00:22:26,256
data which we have for this customer in terms of what the

354
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,564
customer has spent so far, what's potential purchasing

355
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:33,028
power or customer sentiment to retain this customer? So let's have

356
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:42,950
a look at the demo there.

357
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,216
Hello, I want to cancel my service,

358
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:50,184
please. I'm so sorry to hear that, ma'am, can you

359
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:53,370
give me the reason why you're looking to leave our service,

360
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,268
please. Yes, it's horrible. I have been down,

361
00:22:57,454 --> 00:23:00,632
I am in a work from home situation. I can't

362
00:23:00,696 --> 00:23:04,044
get anything to log on. I have

363
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,550
had everyone in my home shut down their data

364
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,588
and there's just bot enough support coverage out here apparently,

365
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,792
or I was misled when I was told that you guys cover

366
00:23:15,846 --> 00:23:19,392
this area or a tower is down something.

367
00:23:19,446 --> 00:23:23,264
I've call multiple times and I

368
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,740
can't continue to go on like this, so I'm going to go with another service

369
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,628
provider. In fact, they're cheaper and

370
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:34,756
I've been a loyal customer to you guys and I am

371
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:38,472
beyond frustrated right now. I'm so sorry to

372
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:42,356
hear the number of problems you have been through and I'm

373
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:46,596
really sorry for you have to put up with this while you're

374
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:49,976
working from home, but I'm certainly going to look into it if there is a

375
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:53,384
problem within your alexa. But while I do that AWS, you've been our loyal

376
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,764
customer. We could actually provide you a 30% discount for

377
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:00,236
a year. You could provide me with what? I'm sorry,

378
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:03,310
30% of discount for the entire year?

379
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,512
You're going to give me can entire discount for an entire year?

380
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:11,856
Absolutely. 30% off my current bill? Absolutely,

381
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:15,300
ma'am. As you've been our loyal customer and the problems

382
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,852
you have to put up with, so hence the reason we have an offer available

383
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:22,390
for you for 30% discount for can entire year.

384
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,150
That is awesome. Okay,

385
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,644
excellent bot. That still doesn't help me with my problem about

386
00:24:30,682 --> 00:24:34,184
not having data. Now chat,

387
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,636
can you do for me now to help fix that issue? Because I'm

388
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:40,632
literally having to drive to a coffee shop to work.

389
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:43,596
No, absolutely, ma'am. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to escalate this to

390
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:47,324
our technical team and we will have somebody from the technical team reach

391
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:51,068
out to you straight right after this call and they should be able to

392
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:54,496
walk you through the troubleshooting steps. And I'm sure you must have already gone

393
00:24:54,518 --> 00:24:57,824
through these steps, but yes, again, until we have

394
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:01,424
those data with us that what is the problem then?

395
00:25:01,462 --> 00:25:05,948
Possibly they are the best people to walk you through how

396
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:09,476
to get that fixed. But rest, be assured there are

397
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:12,928
people who are going to look after you and I'll make sure that's been followed

398
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,276
up properly and then I'll give you a call tomorrow morning again just to check

399
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:20,584
whether everything has been looked after. You. Thank you so much. That is

400
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:23,704
awesome. Thank you so much. I look forward to speaking to you.

401
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,252
Excellent. Cool, ma'am. So I will put your discount

402
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:30,840
on the account and I'll base a case for technical support.

403
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,188
And then there will be somebody in touch with you from the technical team and

404
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:37,048
then I'll give you a call tomorrow morning again just to follow up how you're

405
00:25:37,064 --> 00:25:41,336
getting on with it. Thank you so much. You are fantastic.

406
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:44,684
Thank you. I will talk to you soon. All right, excellent. Can you have,

407
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:48,144
sir? Thank you. Bye. So here we go. In that demo,

408
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:51,856
as you can see, we enabled the agent to provide the

409
00:25:51,878 --> 00:25:55,776
right information to the right time. It's an unhappy customer. We offered

410
00:25:55,808 --> 00:25:58,820
her the 30% discount on the entire bill of that year.

411
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,532
At the same time, the agent wasn't then able to go and speak

412
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:05,764
to the technical team and assure her that

413
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:09,224
she's going to be services with the current information right

414
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:12,888
after the call. So that's again powered by the AI services.

415
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:16,232
So we'll just look into it. How do we went about building

416
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:20,556
this up? So what we have is we

417
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:24,284
have the customer data which is hosted in the dynamodb to

418
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:28,584
start with. And then what we build, we build the Neptune relationship mapping

419
00:26:28,632 --> 00:26:31,628
on the data that we have available from this customer data,

420
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:34,928
be it the CRM or be it the other data sources. What we have.

421
00:26:35,014 --> 00:26:39,216
And then we use Amazon, Kendra in the background to search some

422
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:42,304
of the information. What we needed. But at the same time, what we did,

423
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:46,308
we used the customized personalization where we build the

424
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:50,164
using sagemaker, the personal office, based on the

425
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:53,604
criteria we just looked at in terms of the customer spend,

426
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:57,176
customer sentiment and customer purchasing power. And then we

427
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:01,336
made that available to the agent on the control panel itself.

428
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:04,196
At the same time, what we did within the contact flows,

429
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:07,080
the way we routed the call.

430
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,830
What we did, we build that agent mapping the optimal agent

431
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,624
using the Neptune relationship. We'll just dive in on slider

432
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:19,348
two, how we went about that. But again, we did some three dimensional

433
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:23,328
checks to build that optimal agent versus the

434
00:27:23,414 --> 00:27:26,960
customer inquiry. And then we then pair up

435
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,256
the agent to the customer call to be able

436
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:34,544
to better serve that customer. So let's just dive in into the relationship

437
00:27:34,662 --> 00:27:38,004
mapping. Let's dive deeper into the Amazon Neptune graph data model.

438
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:41,444
What we build. So we build a three dimensional relationship with the customer

439
00:27:41,642 --> 00:27:45,572
to see customer to sentiment, customer to product and customer

440
00:27:45,626 --> 00:27:49,096
to spend. And we tag that as customer sentiment, customer package and customer spend.

441
00:27:49,198 --> 00:27:53,320
And this is what then driving that ML to be able to publish

442
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,444
my offers for the day of my offer, if I'm churning customer

443
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:03,260
and at the same time, my future sales

444
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,550
cycles, I could run with this customer and then I can then match

445
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,008
the customers base sell based on the products.

446
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:14,892
So 75 gig as a package and I'll have Asif and EJ,

447
00:28:15,036 --> 00:28:18,560
David and Sam. All these customers

448
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,224
are using the same product and they're all happy customers. And at the same

449
00:28:22,262 --> 00:28:25,824
time, out of those, Asif and David are

450
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:29,492
the only people who have that spend category to go to the next level,

451
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:33,076
whereas the others can stay where they are as they are happy on what they

452
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:36,544
are and then they haven't been spending with us a lot, whereas Asif and David

453
00:28:36,592 --> 00:28:40,056
have been using other services. So that means they're more likely they

454
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:43,016
can go on to the other services. That way we can build a relationship.

455
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:46,312
Now, at the same time, in terms of the agent,

456
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:49,608
we can look at the agent sentiment. It's a two way door. So we'll look

457
00:28:49,614 --> 00:28:52,652
at the agent sentiment itself, that how the agent been serving and how the agent

458
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:56,444
been filling while services to that customer, how much revenue that particular agent

459
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:59,724
has generated so far. And at the same time the product knowledge itself

460
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:03,320
does. The agent has that particular product knowledge. So when the

461
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,496
call comes in from the customer, say for example, Asif is calling, who is

462
00:29:06,518 --> 00:29:10,156
a happy customer who has very good spending power and he's

463
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:14,224
using 75 gig package. So when it comes to agents, I will look at the

464
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:18,064
agent who has higher cs score and a good sentiment.

465
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:21,536
At the same time he hasn't attend the revenue,

466
00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:25,396
but it's a good attendment. AWS far AWS converting the

467
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:29,156
inquiries to sales goes at the same time does the agent has got product knowledge

468
00:29:29,188 --> 00:29:32,868
in 75 week package itself plus the next level package.

469
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:37,204
So that way it's more likely that agent could highlight some of the deficiencies

470
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:41,048
in the 75 week package and how the customer can overcome

471
00:29:41,144 --> 00:29:44,952
those deficiencies in the next level package. So that way I can convert this inquiry

472
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,504
into sales. So that's Amazon

473
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:52,648
Neptune for you. So let's dive into the connect flow itself. So how

474
00:29:52,674 --> 00:29:56,192
did we do this in Amazon connect? This is the workflow where we've been using

475
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:59,564
lambdas which invokes the AML service endpoint to grab

476
00:29:59,612 --> 00:30:02,828
the data points that are required to either route

477
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:06,580
the call or provide the prompts to an agent or provide

478
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,656
some data points to an agent to better serve the customer or to the AI

479
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,676
bot itself. How we pulling the information from the

480
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:17,770
background to be able to put that into the bot itself.

481
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,128
Some data sample for you in the background. This is

482
00:30:23,134 --> 00:30:27,012
how the CRM data looks like. So we have customer phone number, product soldiers,

483
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:30,280
how many call the customer has made so far, the data plan,

484
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,790
blah blah blah and the pin number and the sentiment at the top.

485
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,576
And this is the ML model, what we have in the background, which is predicting

486
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:41,132
the churn, plus it's predicting the customer evolution AWS such

487
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:44,380
for the building of the offers.

488
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,664
And that's the end of what I had to share today. Thank you for tuning

489
00:30:48,712 --> 00:30:52,356
in and thanks to conf fourty two team for opportunity.

490
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:56,484
In this session we looked at the Amazon Connect, the first truly omnichannel cloud

491
00:30:56,522 --> 00:30:59,584
contact sensor and how our customers are using it to deliver

492
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:03,460
dynamic, natural and personalized experiences at call using

493
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,964
ML technologies in the background. So thank you very much

494
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:09,012
for your time so far today. Have a good one.
