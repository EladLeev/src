00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,346
Morning everyone. My name is Rupesh Kumar. I'm the

2
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:40,818
principal DevOps working with Andrew Foster who is the

3
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:44,098
director of DevOps Engineering at Humana. And we

4
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:47,374
are very excited here to bring forth our journey

5
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:51,346
of DevOps and how

6
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:54,706
we have done it. And we would like to share some insights which

7
00:00:54,728 --> 00:00:58,234
you can take it back to your organization and hopefully you will

8
00:00:58,272 --> 00:01:02,026
find some good value in it. So I have

9
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:05,562
been working in this field for over 20 years and I've been

10
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:09,354
working with both the federal sector and the commercial sector.

11
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:12,734
And as of recently we have been doing some

12
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:16,446
good, amazing work in DevOps outside the

13
00:01:16,468 --> 00:01:19,706
industry. Now Humana has leading that effort and Andrew

14
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:23,214
Foster certainly has been leading this from past few years.

15
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:27,220
And I have joined his team and we are kind of making

16
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,866
DevOps at a scale. So that's where I come

17
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:34,340
in and I would hand it over to Andrew to kind of introduce and

18
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,310
take it away from there. Thank you, Rapesh. Great intro

19
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,974
sir. Welcome everyone to our session again.

20
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:45,206
My name is Andrew Foster, I'm the director of DevOps Engineering here at

21
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:48,986
Humana and my team is responsible for all

22
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,966
of the DevOps platforms, whether it's open systems, mainframe or salesforce.

23
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:56,758
For Humana, we care for the engineer experience as well as the engineers

24
00:01:56,774 --> 00:02:00,678
tooling. So everything around engineering software. We are

25
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:04,334
the it team for the it teams in which we take great

26
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:08,186
passion in. I've been at Humana since 2011 holding

27
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:11,966
various technical roles and been doing the DevOps for the

28
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:15,150
past four years. And I love it every day.

29
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,860
Rapesh, could you hit the next slide, sir? Sure.

30
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,526
Thank you. Before we get into much about our journey,

31
00:02:22,638 --> 00:02:25,878
as Rupesh mentioned earlier, we wanted to tell you a little

32
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:29,526
bit about Humana. So Humana is a Fortune 41

33
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:33,494
health and wellness company. We view ourselves as more than just

34
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:37,138
traditional insurance and we are what

35
00:02:37,164 --> 00:02:41,674
we call a human care company. We take a unique approach to

36
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:44,986
healthcare that's completely centered on people and all the

37
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:48,934
things that they need to feel whole for just a little bit of context.

38
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:52,474
We're the fifth largest health insurer in the United, started among publicly

39
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:56,186
traveled insurers, and our primary business is serving

40
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,466
our 5.1 million individual and group medicare advantage

41
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:02,734
members. We also serve our active duty and veteran military

42
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,420
families, offer group insurance and other standalone wellness products.

43
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,026
All right Rapesh, hit the next slide, sir. And so as

44
00:03:11,048 --> 00:03:14,626
you can tell at Humana, we really value

45
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:18,866
our members and everything that we do. All of the software that we deliver

46
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:22,326
is in support of our members to make their experience better while they're using

47
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:26,234
our products and using their healthcare benefits. So how does DevOps fit into

48
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,498
that? Well, our mission is to,

49
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,870
as you see on the slide, give the engineers the most compelling

50
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,886
development experience possible, and we take that seriously.

51
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:41,182
We aspire to get out of the engineers ways,

52
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:44,398
allow them to focus on software delivery only,

53
00:03:44,564 --> 00:03:47,774
and give them the best experience possible while they're doing that.

54
00:03:47,972 --> 00:03:52,314
Repesh, I'll hand it to you to get into how our Humana

55
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,630
values have inspired the DevOps transformation here at Humana.

56
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,506
Thank you, Andrew. So, as Andrew said, our DevOps journey started

57
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:03,518
at Humana in 2018 with the leadership team wanting

58
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,822
to actually drive change. Now, as you can see,

59
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:09,814
our core values define our culture. Now,

60
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:13,478
culture is what makes people understand each other better.

61
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:16,674
You may be wondering why culture has to do with DevOps.

62
00:04:16,722 --> 00:04:20,570
Well, we say that culture is pretty much everything to do with DevOps,

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,650
because everything is driven by the people, for the people,

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,554
and of the people. So that's where DevOps actually fits in very

65
00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:32,906
perfectly. Now, our strength is in developing

66
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:36,510
a uniqueness and to kind of always question

67
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,934
the status quo. And that's pretty much what we always do as

68
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:43,602
part of this team. We have a diverse workforce, and we

69
00:04:43,656 --> 00:04:47,810
are always able to bring in their unique strengths and

70
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,538
even the weaknesses and kind of see how we can complement each other.

71
00:04:51,704 --> 00:04:55,802
Now, with the different thinking styles of people we have in our workforce,

72
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:59,250
it always good to look at the problems from different perspective.

73
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,374
And that has always helped us to actually look

74
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:05,734
at the status quo and keep innovating, if you will.

75
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:09,638
Now, as Leonardo da Vinci once said, I remember that very

76
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:12,250
clearly in one of the book which I read. It said,

77
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,186
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. So one of the things which we

78
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,580
do at Humana with respect to DevOps is to make things simple,

79
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,078
as Andy was saying earlier, because we do it for our developer community

80
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:27,454
and at the end of the day, for the customers. So we need to make

81
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:32,074
the process simple, which can be understood and kind of like easily

82
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:35,426
scalable as well, at the same time. Now, one of the other

83
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:39,186
things which we also do at Humana is focus on

84
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,894
health. And certainly, needless to say, because we are the healthcare

85
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,894
company, so health is one of the utmost things.

86
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:49,830
So we inspire that the person is always

87
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,794
emotionally, physically, and spiritually available, and they are inspired

88
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:56,040
to work in a community.

89
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,482
And in order to do that, we actually have lot of

90
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:05,482
different online communities, channels, talk shows,

91
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:09,034
where we talk about the overall health of the

92
00:06:09,072 --> 00:06:12,942
individual, because a happy employee makes the happy customer.

93
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:17,120
And that's what at least I believe in. So that's where I would say our

94
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,194
company culture has trickled down into our DevOps,

95
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:24,754
and that's what we see every day, and we live and breathe that. So with

96
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:28,114
that said, I will actually take you on to the next screen where

97
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:32,302
we talk about how we have developed this Humana DevOps

98
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:36,342
model and which has been working for us pretty

99
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,894
efficiently. Now, in order

100
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,574
to make things happen incrementally and

101
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:47,206
iteratively, it's very important for us to kind

102
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:50,554
of like listen to the customers. So one of the things which we have

103
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:54,298
started doing is we are paying more attention to what the customer

104
00:06:54,384 --> 00:06:58,122
needs and wants are by doing active listening. Most of the time

105
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:01,226
you may feel, hey, that something is a second nature. We always do

106
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:04,766
that. But you will be surprised how much we can learn when we are

107
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:08,910
actively listening to our customer. And even for things where they are not even

108
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,414
saying it, but they may actually be

109
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,858
talking around it. But then the good thing is to listen to the

110
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:19,314
customer, pay attention to what they are saying, and kind of

111
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:22,722
identify where their pain points are. And that

112
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,646
actually has helped us tremendously to build on some of the

113
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:30,406
value which we introduced, which created a big

114
00:07:30,428 --> 00:07:34,166
win for us, or some may call

115
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:37,786
it as a low hanging fruit. So certainly active listening is

116
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:41,034
certainly the big one. And then the other one is

117
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:45,734
kind of making sure that you are repeating

118
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:49,414
yourself to the customer to understand that you have understood

119
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:52,830
it right, because that's something which I have seen many a times where we

120
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,254
miss on the expectations of what customer really is

121
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:59,550
saying versus what we are kind of understanding.

122
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,634
Next thing is empower. Now, how do we make

123
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:07,486
sure that the customer is providing

124
00:08:07,518 --> 00:08:11,474
us the requirements and what he wants to get done and who is

125
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:15,142
making it happen? So we certainly believe in

126
00:08:15,196 --> 00:08:17,880
that. The team is,

127
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,606
I mean, it takes a village to drive a

128
00:08:21,628 --> 00:08:25,206
change. So the same thing goes in our DevOps. So we have a

129
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:29,110
culmination of diverse team members who come from different backgrounds,

130
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,580
and we empower them to actually innovate and even to

131
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,086
fail smart fail rather quickly than later.

132
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:42,046
So that's where we provide all the capabilities to the developers to

133
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:45,662
come in on the platforms to actually

134
00:08:45,716 --> 00:08:49,694
talk and experiences and see how things can happen.

135
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:52,580
So empower is one of the key things which we do,

136
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,594
and then certainly the guide. So making sure that when

137
00:08:58,632 --> 00:09:02,158
you are bringing on DevOps to a large organization like Humana,

138
00:09:02,254 --> 00:09:05,854
you have to have a set of defined

139
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:07,982
principles, standards,

140
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:11,686
patterns, policies, because it

141
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,366
could very well go in many different directions. And certainly we want

142
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,478
to make sure that there is a standardized

143
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:23,418
process for doing DevOps and in order to do that,

144
00:09:23,584 --> 00:09:26,870
one of the things which we have started working on is bringing

145
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,366
principles, standards, policies around, how to do the

146
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:34,602
branching strategy, how to do progressive delivery, how to do Gitops,

147
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,154
how to do environment strategies and microservices.

148
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:42,382
So quite a few things which are out there. We have standardized

149
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:45,666
it so that the developers can feel that they are part of the community and

150
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:49,410
they can work together in

151
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,122
not only digesting it, but also helping out

152
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:56,786
other development communities, which we already have in Humana.

153
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:01,014
So we have a team of over, we have over

154
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:04,566
400 plus teams within Humana. And I think it takes a

155
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:08,554
village, again, to kind of make things happen. And that's where this

156
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:13,210
guide certainly helps in doing that. The other important

157
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,874
thing as part of this model is the

158
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:20,174
data. How do you collect the data? Like making sure

159
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:24,174
that in order for you to know that is

160
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:27,806
my DevOps improving the user experience, is it

161
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:32,046
helping the developer do the

162
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:35,758
right way of doing DevOps? We call it as realistic DevOps.

163
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:39,266
Now, in order to gather that metrics, we certainly have to

164
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:42,354
make sure that everything is flowing into data.

165
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,942
Lakes and tools like big data

166
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:49,698
superset comes to rescue, where we can mine

167
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:54,120
the data, we can analyze the data, we can run

168
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,510
simulations on it and see how it goes. And we build our okrs,

169
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,066
the objective ski and results around it as to how we

170
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:07,130
can iteratively and incrementally improve

171
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,326
the overall experience of DevOps for the developer community

172
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:14,554
and eventually for the customers as well. So gather

173
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:19,102
the data and then certainly measure the data depending upon different

174
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:23,070
tools which you have and kind of make that happen. So I guess

175
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,290
with that, I would say that currently this is our model.

176
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,682
I would not say that this model is the only model,

177
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:33,202
but this is the model which currently works for us and we are using

178
00:11:33,256 --> 00:11:36,406
this every day to make it better for the life of the

179
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:40,054
developer. And Andrew will now talk

180
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:43,686
about what we have done so far and the

181
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,218
other aspects of how we are scaling DevOps for a

182
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:50,860
large organization like Humana. And then he will also share some of

183
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,806
the key personas which exist in Humana.

184
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:58,826
And we'll wrap it up by talking about some of the benefits

185
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:02,414
and some of the return on investment which

186
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:06,030
we have seen with DevOps. With that, I will hand it over to Andrew.

187
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,990
Thank you. Rapesh. Great job summarizing our approach. I think

188
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,654
the emphasis on the engineer and how we can get feedback

189
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:17,780
and support that experience, that's really the key.

190
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,034
So let me get into a little bit of specifics right

191
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:25,806
about how do we do the DevOps in a large enterprise

192
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:29,398
like Humana. And I'll take you guys all the way

193
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:32,726
back to 2018 and kind of the approach that we took as

194
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:36,630
we move forward, there are really three key steps

195
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,790
and three key kind of methodologies, if you will, that unlocked

196
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,850
our ability to really scale DevOps.

197
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,930
The first one I will talk about is alignment and feedback.

198
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,086
It's hard to really do anything in a large enterprise, as many

199
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:57,070
of you know, I'm sure many of the folks watching here work in large corporations

200
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,710
without alignment and a go forward strategy.

201
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,266
And I would say in 2018, Humana was in

202
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:08,942
a unique position, organizationally, where we achieved

203
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:12,958
a significant amount of alignment across a broad spectrum

204
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:16,998
of the engineers community, which allowed us to really build

205
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:20,226
momentum and take significant ground towards DevOps

206
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,218
adoption. So that alignment across the organization,

207
00:13:23,314 --> 00:13:26,390
across every segment, delivering software,

208
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,966
that is probably one of the key, most foundational things that

209
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:34,474
has unlocked everything that we've done as we've moved forward.

210
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:38,566
The other piece of it is once you get that alignment, it's really tight feedback

211
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:42,666
loops. So regular updates to leaders, regular feedback

212
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,182
sessions with engineers to make sure that we are, in fact,

213
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:48,142
building and delivering the capabilities that they, in fact,

214
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:51,986
need. So those regular, really tight feedback loops helped us

215
00:13:52,008 --> 00:13:55,586
stay on track and continue to stay in that, I would

216
00:13:55,608 --> 00:13:59,522
say, state of alignment across the organization. The second

217
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:02,926
key was to focus on platforms and tools

218
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,430
that are engineer focused. And the key to that was

219
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,226
we kind of set a rule at the beginning, is that in order to release

220
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:13,846
software to production, we don't want an engineer to have

221
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:18,234
to leave their native platforms. So our

222
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:22,806
goal was to have our Humana engineers stay within the DevOps platforms

223
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:27,242
and manage their change through our change process using

224
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:30,694
their pipelines. And for them to never have to leave that interface,

225
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:34,014
they should never have to go to a CMDB tool, to some kind of change

226
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:37,678
management tool. They stay within their native tooling and get all

227
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:41,490
the feedback they need, and the processes are integrated there at that point.

228
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,154
So that was really key. And then the other thing

229
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:47,886
is just platforms that are engineer focused,

230
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:51,666
right? Platforms that help engineers understand

231
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:55,314
what their posture of their software is that they're creating, whether it's secure or whether

232
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:59,590
it's quality software. These things need to be integrated into their workflow.

233
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,254
And just not only that, but just the core platforms should be easy

234
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:06,726
to use. Right. And engineer first. And we

235
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:10,054
not only did that for our open systems, but we also took an approach

236
00:15:10,102 --> 00:15:13,334
where we have a unique experience for our mainframe engineers.

237
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:16,714
Humana still has quite a bit of mainframe activity or

238
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:20,746
development, as well as Salesforce. So we have a unique set of

239
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:22,910
tooling for each of these personas.

240
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,238
And then the third step, I would say that was most important. And I'll talk

241
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:31,774
about this a little more detail on the next slide. But Humana is

242
00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:35,326
a highly regulated, we're in a highly regulated industry within healthcare

243
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:38,498
and primarily our Medicare business, working with

244
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,858
the federal government. And so it's really important to us from a

245
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:45,986
business perspective that we adhere to

246
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:50,146
change best practices and that we have traceability and that we're passing our audit

247
00:15:50,178 --> 00:15:53,670
and compliances and not only to our business, but it's important to our members,

248
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,826
right, that we're operating our software in a secure way and that we're running

249
00:15:56,848 --> 00:16:00,166
our business in a secure way from a software perspective.

250
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:03,622
So we were able to come up with a very unique,

251
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:06,938
actually now patented solution to

252
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,398
automate Humana's SDLC. Not yet, Rapesh. Go back to

253
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,774
the other side, if you don't mind, sir. You're fine. Jumping ahead.

254
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:17,742
You get excited. I love it.

255
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,906
But we took a very unique

256
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,042
approach to automating those checks into the pipelines. Again, keeping that

257
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,662
approach that we want the engineers to stay within their native tooling.

258
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:31,070
And then I would say the final bit is smaller releases,

259
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,698
right. In order to do DevOps, we have to release smaller

260
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:38,466
in order to iterate and move faster. And that's actually safer and healthier

261
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:42,566
for a software development team. And so driving our

262
00:16:42,588 --> 00:16:46,518
releases and creating a strong mapping between application components

263
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:50,746
and repositories not only allowed us to categorize our

264
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:54,954
source code in a unique way, but also to

265
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:58,694
help have an enterprise push to drive towards those smaller componentized

266
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:02,030
releases. So I would say those three key things

267
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,614
really, and there's a lot in that, right? But those three high

268
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:09,726
level things really helped Humana unlock DevOps. And we've been on a

269
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:13,030
really fast ride ever since we've done that. So Rapesh

270
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,620
with that, if you don't mind. Jump to the next slide, sir. Thank you.

271
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,546
So let's talk a little bit about Greenlight API. So this is

272
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:24,306
our patented solution to incorporating Humana's

273
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:28,600
SDLC into the DevOps pipelines. And so

274
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,074
what you see around kind of the traditional DevOps

275
00:17:33,122 --> 00:17:35,400
Infinity sign that we've all seen,

276
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,466
you have the Humana SDLC, right? The phases of

277
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:41,370
that. So plan, deploy,

278
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,294
sorry, plan, build, deploy, accept,

279
00:17:46,342 --> 00:17:49,710
feedback. You have the phases of that worked

280
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,760
in to the pipelines in such a way that

281
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,394
Greenland API, which is again, kind of our homegrown Humana

282
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:02,014
naming, but Greenland API is a task that lives

283
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:05,218
in the DevOps pipelines, it's required and in fact enforced to

284
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:08,786
be there. And it gives the developers feedback as

285
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:12,178
they go upon their software development journey. So as soon as they make a

286
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:16,098
commit into their repo and they run their build pipeline, Greenlight API

287
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:19,458
is telling them which parts of the SDLC they've adhered

288
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:23,378
to or which parts they haven't. Not only that, but it's enforcing

289
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:27,578
not just SDLC, but also things like security scanning, code quality

290
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:31,514
scanning, a tight relationship between the source code

291
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:35,654
repository and the change management or CMDB

292
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:39,102
database. These things are really

293
00:18:39,156 --> 00:18:42,622
important in the way that we

294
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:46,414
stitch the releases together for the engineers and stitch that

295
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:50,254
feedback together, right? So that by the time the engineer gets

296
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:53,250
to the point where they're ready to release to production,

297
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,886
they've adhered to the Humana SDLC and all the requirements that Humana

298
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:01,714
has to deploy software just by using

299
00:19:01,752 --> 00:19:05,054
their pipeline, right? And then an integration with our change

300
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:08,338
system, which is in service now, as you see in the diagram,

301
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:12,374
automatically opens change orders for those developers and so

302
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:15,042
sends them through the approval process. So literally,

303
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:18,970
DevOps do not have to leave their pipeline interface to

304
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,726
release software in a certified and trusted

305
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:27,162
way at Humana. And it's really helped us to get to a repeatable process where

306
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:31,402
again, engineers are first, right? Because while yes, we're a large enterprise and

307
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:35,134
we have rules and regulations and things that we have to follow

308
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:38,714
to our jobs, that doesn't mean that we can't do it in an engineer

309
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,138
first way. And so that's what we've done here with greenlight API.

310
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,590
So we're very excited about this, very proud of it. And it's

311
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,098
one of the things that has, as you saw in the last slide, that has

312
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,406
really helped us unlock our DevOps journey. So let's

313
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:54,040
talk a little bit about our developer experience.

314
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,310
Again, I mentioned earlier, we have a unique diagram

315
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,646
and kind of experience for each of our

316
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:06,822
personas. So we consider open systems, which would be our traditional net,

317
00:20:06,876 --> 00:20:09,942
Java, Python, et cetera, programming languages,

318
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:13,850
to be open systems. And then of course, mainframe has its own experience.

319
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,474
And Salesforce, we won't get into those as much today.

320
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:20,774
We've actually done other talks on our mainframe dev experience at BMC exchange

321
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:24,240
last year. You guys can go find that presentation if you're interested in it.

322
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,014
But for today, we'll focus on open systems. So again,

323
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:31,398
you can see that we have the tooling aligned

324
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:35,394
to the phases of our SDLC and which

325
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:39,326
tool is used, at which point I won't just drain this slide

326
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:43,518
right I think the audience can get a general overview

327
00:20:43,614 --> 00:20:47,666
and kind of understanding, especially since you're all DevOps practices.

328
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:51,206
I think the most important thing I would call out here though is that all

329
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:55,670
of this tooling is integrated, right? It's integrated in such a way that

330
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,346
developers can self service, right? So if

331
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,546
the platform didn't offer it, we've built automations in

332
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:07,126
the thing that we call our developer control plane where engineers can provision their sonar

333
00:21:07,158 --> 00:21:10,602
queue projects or set up their artifactory JFrog repos.

334
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,606
Right, to manage open source software. So we've taken great pain to

335
00:21:14,628 --> 00:21:18,014
integrate these solutions in a way that are easy

336
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:21,086
for developers to use. But we're also, I would

337
00:21:21,108 --> 00:21:24,626
say, really passionate about a sense of ownership. So while

338
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:28,338
as an enterprise team we offer these capabilities, we integrate them,

339
00:21:28,424 --> 00:21:32,414
we make them available and we provide tremendous guidance

340
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:36,046
on when and how they should be used. We really are pushing towards

341
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:39,666
a sense of ownership for development teams to build and own their pipelines

342
00:21:39,778 --> 00:21:42,280
because they are part of the application itself.

343
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,010
And again, that's where our guardrails come in, right? That's where we have

344
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,962
the governance of Greenlight API to ensure that while

345
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:53,834
teams have ownership, they also have some

346
00:21:53,872 --> 00:21:57,882
oversight. Right, and that Greenlight API is going to ensure that before

347
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,386
a release makes it to production, before that release is allowed

348
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:03,630
to run and deploy to the production environment.

349
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:08,314
All the checks have been followed, right? All the scanning happened in the build phase

350
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:11,674
the right way. By the time in the accept phase

351
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:14,618
we ensure that all the testing was completed in the right way, whether it was

352
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:17,906
performance testing or manual testing. And then once they get

353
00:22:17,928 --> 00:22:21,966
to deploy, we make sure that the change management process was followed using Servicenow.

354
00:22:21,998 --> 00:22:25,126
And again, all that's automated. But there's some governance there to

355
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:27,670
make sure that while teams have that ownership,

356
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,560
they're still empowered to do it themselves.

357
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,414
So very excited about this. It's been

358
00:22:35,452 --> 00:22:38,726
kind of the culmination of several years. So Rupesh, I'll kick

359
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:42,380
it to you man, and let you talk a little bit about some of the

360
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,740
value that we've realized from the work that we've done.

361
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,562
Sorry Andrew. Thank you. I think I might have hit the slide.

362
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:54,720
You were ready to quit too early, rapesh. We're not done yet.

363
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,014
I guess this is where everything comes to

364
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:03,650
the fruition of all the hard work, Andrew, you and your team, and done from

365
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,266
past four years, I would say so, I guess. How did we

366
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:11,394
do? So to put things in perspective, Humana has over 1600

367
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:15,030
applications and components with over 300 teams,

368
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,806
which are members from around the world. Who are

369
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:22,374
actually working day in and day out, except for the weekends and

370
00:23:22,412 --> 00:23:26,166
evenings, certainly, but certainly across different time zones.

371
00:23:26,278 --> 00:23:29,450
And we have over 10 million lines of code

372
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,478
with over 17,000 CI CD pipelines.

373
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:37,162
And these are pretty much managed and powered by over

374
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,886
24 tools which are owned by the DevOps

375
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:44,794
platform team now. So I guess one of the high level statistics

376
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:47,982
which I want you to take away from here is that we have seen over

377
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:51,098
56% of automation

378
00:23:51,274 --> 00:23:54,506
releases over manual releases. And when Andy

379
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:58,558
was talking about the glappy, the green light API, which is one of the

380
00:23:58,724 --> 00:24:02,610
SGLC policy check kind of a tool which has been patented

381
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,238
by this team. So this actually has allowed us to automate the

382
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:10,582
releases to production, where it builds the trust with the change

383
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:14,242
management and enablement team to actually make the releases

384
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:17,994
go much quicker, much faster and with

385
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:21,194
much quality. So 56% automation we have done.

386
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:25,702
And there is an 80% of a lead time which has been experienced

387
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:29,374
with respect to the dura metrics, certainly with the lead

388
00:24:29,412 --> 00:24:32,480
time, the wait time, the cycle time, the process time.

389
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,222
And certainly this is the figures which we have

390
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:40,302
run a couple of weeks ago. I'm sure this

391
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:43,658
might be going up as we speak, because most of the

392
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:46,766
teams are actually on the DevOps journey.

393
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,674
And the teams which have taken on the DevOps adoption now,

394
00:24:50,712 --> 00:24:53,934
they are actually trying to mature DevOps and they want to do the right thing.

395
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,598
So certainly you will see a bit more numbers

396
00:24:58,684 --> 00:25:02,454
going up as we speak. And then the overall we

397
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:06,760
have, 97% of our releases are eligible for

398
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,446
releases in production. What it basically means is that the entire CI

399
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:15,066
CD stages of the pipeline, all the infinity loop which

400
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:19,022
Andrew was showing earlier, all the different stages of the pipeline, they all

401
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:22,154
meet the SDLC Humana standards.

402
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:26,142
And that is a pretty big number for us. And I

403
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:29,562
hope that in the future we keep exceeding and keep adding

404
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:33,674
more metrics to capture more streamlined processes and

405
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,700
kind of make it happen for the team. Now with that, I would say that

406
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,226
certainly, Andrew, let me just take it back. Do you have

407
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:45,362
anything else you would like to add here, Andrew, before we wrap it up?

408
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:48,726
No, you did a great job. Rapesh. Thank you, sir. Thank you,

409
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:52,166
Andrew. So I guess, as we all know, DevOps is certainly a

410
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:55,350
journey and not a destination. So hopefully next year

411
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,034
Andrew and I will come back again to share new

412
00:25:59,072 --> 00:26:03,020
challenges and opportunities which we came across and we

413
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,066
overcame them in Humana. And we would like to

414
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:10,634
kind of share our stories and certainly learn

415
00:26:10,672 --> 00:26:14,106
from your experience and stories as well. So with

416
00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:17,642
that, I would say thank you for tuning in and

417
00:26:17,696 --> 00:26:20,866
joining our session and hope you have benefited with our

418
00:26:20,888 --> 00:26:23,630
key insights and experiences which we laid.

419
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,682
And hope you have a wonderful evening and other

420
00:26:27,736 --> 00:26:30,338
sessions with that. Thank you so much,

421
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:33,890
Andrew. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

422
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,186
Bye, everyone. Take care,
