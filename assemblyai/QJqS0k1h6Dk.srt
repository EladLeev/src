00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,240
Hi, this is Tom Henricksen and humans are hard, code is easy.

2
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,186
Here's a string of thoughts that ran across my mind early in my programming

3
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:07,686
career. Why can't people just leave me alone and I

4
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:11,750
can do my work? I can figure this stuff out myself.

5
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,094
I don't need others help or any input to turn this thing

6
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:18,986
around. Why don't people understand me?

7
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:22,970
I think it must be they're just dumb. They don't recognize

8
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,898
genius when they see it.

9
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:29,606
Perhaps you've been there too, a frustrated developer

10
00:02:29,638 --> 00:02:33,390
who feels like they know enough. However, the success

11
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,078
you thought you'd have is out of reach.

12
00:02:36,244 --> 00:02:40,286
You see others who make better strides, but why is it

13
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:43,842
a skills gap? I want to share with you how I learned about

14
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,810
my skills gap.

15
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,060
Java check. Linux check.

16
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,798
Sql check. Humans what

17
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:58,918
humans are hard code is easy.

18
00:02:59,084 --> 00:03:02,120
So I focused on the technology.

19
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,106
One of my first mentors was a database administrator named Doyle.

20
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:10,682
He really knew his stuff but didn't say much.

21
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,442
That can make learning challenging. One thing Doyle would do

22
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:16,940
is fix the problem for me.

23
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,720
Doyle would fix it so quickly and then leave.

24
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,680
What did you do? He was already gone.

25
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,006
Working with Doyle gave me some insight. Technical people

26
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:33,966
hate explaining basic stuff.

27
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:37,794
Ask them a simple question and they will flip the bozo bit

28
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:40,882
on you. What is the bozo bit?

29
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:44,706
You say? A few years after working with Doyle, I got

30
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:47,890
to work with a software architect named Corey.

31
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,606
He had many interesting observations. One thing he

32
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:55,414
would do if you asked him a stupid know the basic question you

33
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:58,700
could have figured out by doing some research on your own.

34
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,826
He wouldn't answer your questions or work with you.

35
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:06,566
That, my friends, is the bozo. But bozo,

36
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,666
of course, refers to bozo the clown. The bit in reference

37
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:14,842
to computer bit or binary storage code was pretty extreme,

38
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:17,600
but many developers can be that way.

39
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,574
To gain respect from those developers, we need to know the technology.

40
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:26,286
Humans are hard, code is easy. So I focused

41
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:29,794
on the coding. I learned new technologies. I kept my head down

42
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:33,474
and tried to avoid getting the bozo, but flipped on me. A few

43
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:36,850
years later, I transitioned into a new role,

44
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,642
technical lead. One year, during my annual

45
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:44,086
evaluation, my leader said to me, tom, we think

46
00:04:44,108 --> 00:04:47,526
you have solid credentials. Coding skills got you the

47
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,634
job, but we need you to develop other

48
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:54,106
skills. My leader shared with me where I was

49
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,654
failing delegation. He shared how I wasn't delegating

50
00:04:57,702 --> 00:05:01,322
work to my teammates. Case in point, there was an upgrade that needed

51
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:05,070
to be done. I did the work in 10 minutes or so. To explain

52
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,014
that would take a couple of minutes,

53
00:05:08,212 --> 00:05:11,646
10 minutes or more. Another trap I

54
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:14,698
fell into with delegation is the belief in our values.

55
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:18,626
We can convince ourselves that we are worth more when others can't do

56
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:21,906
the same work as us. I remember working with

57
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:25,602
Jamie the first time. I wasn't quite sure he understood what we were doing.

58
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:29,622
He was always done quickly. Then I finally asked him here.

59
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:33,430
He had created a script to deploy changes and update dependencies.

60
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,550
I was doing all this work manually.

61
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,060
I had to figure out a way to do this better.

62
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,218
I could have figured this out better myself, but sometimes

63
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:51,786
you make these mistakes. A few

64
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:54,974
years later, I got to work with a leader named John. We knew

65
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:58,906
each other through a mutual friend. I had begun to coach individuals

66
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:03,582
and teams. John wanted an outside resource to help him change his team's mindset.

67
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:08,142
He shared how most it people work with others in a transactional fashion.

68
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:10,900
We get the requirements and we solve the issue.

69
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,946
John said, tom, my team is

70
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:18,374
like bank tellers. They get asked to fix something and they do.

71
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:22,246
Just like a teller gets a check and deposits the check. I want

72
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:25,634
my team to be more like financial planners. A financial planner

73
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:29,420
builds a relationship, then they can anticipate needs.

74
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,940
So you're saying, john, you want your team to have better relationships with their customers?

75
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,906
John said, tom, if they have better relationships, they will be.

76
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:43,310
But to build relationships and empathy and understanding

77
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,874
relationships. Understanding and. Huh. That won't

78
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:52,494
work. That's what I thought at the time, but I

79
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:55,874
was wrong. John's team. John knew his

80
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:59,010
team needed to understand and develop empathy.

81
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,914
Each change John made helped his team understand. The community directors had

82
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:08,358
many things on their plate. These conversations also worked the

83
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:12,006
other way too. The community directors began to give John's team

84
00:07:12,108 --> 00:07:16,342
space. If something went wrong, they trusted them to resolve it.

85
00:07:16,476 --> 00:07:20,886
John proved me wrong. He overcame his deficit by being curious and empathetic.

86
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:24,518
He was able to change the way his team interacted with the organization,

87
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,890
so much so that he has since been given additional responsibilities.

88
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,226
From bank tellers to financial planners, he remained the image

89
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:36,666
of his it team. This brings

90
00:07:36,698 --> 00:07:39,982
me to my main idea. Coding skills got you the job,

91
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:44,414
influence will get you the career. Coding skills

92
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:47,998
got you the job, influence will get you the career.

93
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:51,982
What do I mean? Developers are focusing on technology skills

94
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,134
only if we truly want to set ourselves apart.

95
00:07:55,182 --> 00:07:58,470
We need to know how to influence and collaboration with teams.

96
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,290
Gone are the days when we could just send in the requirements with pizza

97
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,134
and out pops. Code organizations are looking for more

98
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:10,010
from their developers. The problem? My problem

99
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,878
was I was terrible at relationships. I had confirmation.

100
00:08:14,054 --> 00:08:18,006
I had proof. Although I didn't

101
00:08:18,038 --> 00:08:21,546
start out as a developer, though, my first stop, my professional

102
00:08:21,578 --> 00:08:23,120
career was quite different.

103
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,694
My first job out of college. It seems like

104
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:33,634
yesterday I started at Wallace. What is

105
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:37,122
Wallace, you say? Well, we sold business forms and office

106
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:41,570
supplies in Des Moines, Iowa, kind of like Dunder Mifflin.

107
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:45,942
Armed with a business management degree and no real idea,

108
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:49,318
I had three job options when I graduated from college.

109
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:52,934
I could sell insurance, or I

110
00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,400
could sell life insurance,

111
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,686
or I could sell business forms. So I

112
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,622
did what any sane person would do. I sold business forms.

113
00:09:03,766 --> 00:09:06,234
Who wants to call on our friend's parents for insurance?

114
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:09,706
Anyways, did I mention that Des Moines is the

115
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:13,802
insurance capital of the world? Back to my first day at Wallace.

116
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:17,230
Can you believe I had to make a few cold calls before lunch?

117
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,374
Let me remind you, in college, the only time

118
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:25,386
I called my friends was when we were having a kegger. Getting people

119
00:09:25,428 --> 00:09:28,770
to buy business forms is a bit more difficult than getting college students

120
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,178
to drink beer. Now, I really didn't want to

121
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:35,460
make those calls, but lunch was getting close.

122
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,374
I was given three prospects from another sales representative to

123
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:41,240
call on.

124
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,160
Hello, is Mike Huff available?

125
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,738
Sure. Can you tell him that Tom Henricksen called?

126
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:55,260
Yeah, I'm from Wallace. Click.

127
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,790
Hello, this is Tom Hendrickson, your new Wallace representative.

128
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,046
Oh, sorry, Mr. Hegna. I apologize. If our labels fall off

129
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:11,230
your product. Click. Whoa.

130
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,900
I guess we got disconnected there. Okay,

131
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,890
just one more and we can go to lunch.

132
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,118
What do we call on gentlemen's clubs?

133
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:27,362
My coworkers all die laughing. Turns out this is their way of initiating

134
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:29,510
new sales representatives.

135
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,846
My sales career went down in flames pretty

136
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,306
quickly. Similar to Tommy boy, my sales techniques were

137
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:42,842
not appreciated. Soon after my first day in sales,

138
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:46,170
I started to realize something. This wasn't going

139
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,038
anywhere. A friend of mine from high school shared

140
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:53,786
with me the opportunity in technology. So I began to pursue a different path

141
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,630
and get a new degree.

142
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:00,234
I left my job in sales and began work as a developer.

143
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:03,550
Now, working as a developer is quite a bit different than working in sales.

144
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,106
The sales office I worked in was always full of people talking. They would

145
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:10,580
be talking on the phones to customers or talking to each other.

146
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,526
The developers I worked with, well, they were a quiet bunch

147
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:17,790
on the whole. Friday afternoon in the sales office,

148
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,200
the newest rep had to go get beer for everyone.

149
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,086
Friday afternoon for the developers was quiet, just like the rest

150
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:27,718
of the week. Now perhaps it's starting to sound like I

151
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:31,098
didn't want to make this change, but that was not the case.

152
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:34,518
I slowly began to realize I was more spock than Jimmy

153
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:40,042
Fallon. The quiet, contemplative work of a developer suited me more as

154
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:44,110
my technology career began, I started to work with lots of different tools and

155
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,126
technologies, but I wanted to move into something more current. I started to

156
00:11:48,148 --> 00:11:51,166
hear a lot of buzz around the Java language in

157
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:54,906
my free time and nights and weekends, I would read and work through tutorials.

158
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:58,226
All this work paid off a few months later when a company leader came

159
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:02,082
to me and said, tom, would you be able to help

160
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:06,086
Dave with a new application? It turned out they needed someone who

161
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:09,026
could write an application using Java.

162
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:12,726
I, of course, agreed. Like Luke beginning to

163
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:15,670
use the force. I was starting with some basics.

164
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,246
As my java skills began to improve from experience, I learned

165
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:23,546
a few other things, too. I began to work with someone who was quite

166
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,770
sharp from a technical perspective.

167
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,034
But Eric wasn't easy to get along with. He would yell at

168
00:12:31,072 --> 00:12:34,474
people he worked with. You might say he was a complete jerk.

169
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:38,014
Sometimes the managers and team allowed this to happen, in large

170
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:41,374
part because he was productive. Now, I can

171
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:44,846
still see it. Now when I closed my eyes, Eric was

172
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:49,330
a smoker and he was trying to quit. This made Eric even testier.

173
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,346
Eric and Sri were working together on some files when I came walking down

174
00:12:53,368 --> 00:12:57,890
a row of cubes, and Eric was in Sri's cube yelling,

175
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,286
you know how people get mad and their veins look like they're going to pop

176
00:13:01,308 --> 00:13:05,110
out of their head? Eric's veins were about ready to explode.

177
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,142
Then he ran out the door. I guess

178
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:10,790
he needed the smoke.

179
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,706
I asked Sree if he was okay. He looked at me and said

180
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,258
he was okay, but that no one should have

181
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:23,258
to put up with him. Sri couldn't have

182
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:26,618
been more correct. Eric was a tyrant who ran around like Darth

183
00:13:26,634 --> 00:13:30,286
Vader, intimidating people. But we all put up with his terrible treatment just

184
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:34,094
because he was able to code a lot. Even though many developers act

185
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:37,666
like Spock, we have feelings, too. I would like

186
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:40,194
to tell you that Eric was let go and the team was able to move

187
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:43,794
on. The company did nothing to him. His behavior was left

188
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:47,490
unhandled. Learning how to be a good team player

189
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,142
doesn't come naturally to some. We need to learn the basics to understand

190
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:54,726
how to make the team thrive. Eric wasn't a

191
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:57,590
team player. He was but for himself.

192
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,326
If you work with a coding hero like Eric, they might take all the tough

193
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,818
work and make it easier for others. But this can stunt the overall growth of

194
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:09,370
the group. If you work with a coding hero and they take vacation,

195
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,430
things can fall apart.

196
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:18,750
Let me tell you a story about a leader who dealt with a similar issue.

197
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,150
Now, Ben was a leader that I worked with, and he had a coding hero.

198
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,198
We'll call him Dave now. Dave would code solutions

199
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,460
that were more complex than others could understand.

200
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,174
Dave was coming up on a milestone birthday. To celebrate,

201
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:37,666
he was going to bike across multiple states with all his gear. So he

202
00:14:37,688 --> 00:14:41,014
took off, three weeks. Now, Ben knew this was going to be an issue,

203
00:14:41,052 --> 00:14:44,754
so he met with the team and they discussed the challenges. The team decided

204
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:47,910
to begin to have knowledge transfer sessions with Dave.

205
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,180
Ben helped foster this collaboration with the team.

206
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,982
This enabled the team to slowly chip away at the knowledge gap,

207
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:57,850
and the team became more resilient.

208
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,114
At my next stop, I began to master my skills in Java.

209
00:15:03,162 --> 00:15:06,254
I was responsible for an application that required me to learn

210
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,514
some new technologies. Software development

211
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:13,774
can be a bit like trending song sales on iTunes. One day something's

212
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:16,980
hot, the next day it's out of date.

213
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,330
During this time in my career, many open source tools became popular.

214
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,334
Mastery for Luke Skywalker came after a battle with

215
00:15:25,372 --> 00:15:29,458
Darth Vader. Programming is a lot like writing.

216
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:32,694
As the author Stephen Pressfield says,

217
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:36,546
the amateur tweets the pro works. Professional programmers

218
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,270
show up every day and slay small demons.

219
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,718
The first skills I had to master as a developer was debugging.

220
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:47,482
Of course, today the tools are much more mature. One of the first

221
00:15:47,536 --> 00:15:50,758
applications I had to debug didn't have any such tools.

222
00:15:50,934 --> 00:15:53,802
I was armed with print statements and a log file,

223
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:56,510
quite primitive by today's standards.

224
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,102
All right, let's see here. Where does that value get set?

225
00:16:01,156 --> 00:16:04,322
Here, let's add a print statement recompile. Oh,

226
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:08,142
compile. Error. Forgot the semicolon.

227
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:11,618
Okay, let's add that semicolon recompile. Run the report.

228
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:15,534
No, the database isn't separate. Okay, let me update

229
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:18,534
that table. Run the report. Table up.

230
00:16:18,732 --> 00:16:22,086
Now that looks better. Of course, debugging is so much

231
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:25,010
easier today, but we still need to use the old beam.

232
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,714
As Steve McConnell points out in his book, Code Complete, we need to

233
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:32,166
learn the types of mistakes we make. Early in my Java

234
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:36,314
career, I made the same mistake time and again. I would

235
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:38,490
forget to initialize my variables.

236
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,958
I can still hear my coworker Ken laughing at me when he would look at

237
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:45,710
my code and point out my obvious error.

238
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,574
We need to think about our errors and think

239
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,734
about how we can make them better and learn from them. We need to periodically

240
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:00,180
take a step back and reflect. How can I or we do this better.

241
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,490
Think, apply, reflect.

242
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,680
Software developers like to impress each other.

243
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,320
I had to use the singleton pattern to fix that.

244
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't worry, most developers don't know what that means either.

245
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,114
There are many esoteric topics we can talk about for hours

246
00:17:21,312 --> 00:17:24,138
in essentialism, the disciplined pursuit of less.

247
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:27,622
Greg McEwen shares how important editing is to journalism.

248
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:30,490
Now the journalists bring the stories and the editor.

249
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,402
The journalists bring the stories and write up the ideas. However, the editor

250
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:39,214
has the important job. They review the piece and rework it.

251
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:43,306
Over my years, I've mentored many developers. One in particular sticks

252
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:46,706
out. He began reading about code basics. This made

253
00:17:46,728 --> 00:17:50,786
him add unnecessary code from time to time. I remember debugging an

254
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:53,780
error he was getting together. When I asked him,

255
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,840
why is this loop here?

256
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,706
He looked at me, unsure, and said, I don't

257
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,080
know. I thought it would help.

258
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,986
He thought it would help. Once we removed his

259
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:10,650
unnecessary loop, we resolved his error.

260
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,890
Adding code is easy. Knowing what to keep

261
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,614
is hard. Now, it's not that I'm saying computer science basics

262
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:21,870
are not important. We need to master these too. However,

263
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,390
if we put our sole focus on them, though, our careers will falter.

264
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,626
I spoke before, but Eric. He had mastered

265
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:32,842
computer science. His teammates, though,

266
00:18:32,916 --> 00:18:36,226
couldn't stand him. We need to be good at our work and get

267
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:40,098
along with our team. If we do just one of these, we aren't doing

268
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:41,060
our job.

269
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,578
As I learned more about soft skills, my career progressed.

270
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:52,226
Starting out as a developer. Then I moved into a senior developer

271
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:56,246
role. Next I was a technical lead, and then finally I

272
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,618
moved into manager of software development. This point I was feeling really

273
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:03,578
good about my career progression. I remember it like it

274
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:07,194
was yesterday. It was a Friday morning in

275
00:19:07,232 --> 00:19:10,874
May. I took my kids to school and came into the office at my normal

276
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:14,240
time, a little before 08:00 a.m.

277
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:18,334
Oddly enough though, my boss was in. He usually

278
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:22,094
came in at nine or after. I sat down and

279
00:19:22,132 --> 00:19:25,502
unpacked my things. And then Scott, my boss,

280
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:29,954
came to my desk and said, tom, can I talk with you?

281
00:19:30,152 --> 00:19:33,746
I said, sure, and I followed him to his office. Although when we

282
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:36,520
came to his office, he took a right.

283
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,030
Hmm, that's strange. As I thought, as I followed Scott down the hallway.

284
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,560
Then he took a left into Sandy's office.

285
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,542
Who is Sandy, you ask? Well, she was the director

286
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:53,542
of human resources. We sat down and then Scott

287
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:57,354
looked at me and said, tom, this is your last

288
00:19:57,392 --> 00:19:58,300
day here.

289
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,970
If you've ever had that said to you at work or in a relationship,

290
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,076
you know what it feels like. The rest was strange

291
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:12,264
as I felt a calm come over me. I knew something was going to

292
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:15,128
happen, although as I looked across the table,

293
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:18,380
I could tell Scott and Sandy felt terrible.

294
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,332
They discussed the next steps. I packed my things

295
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,390
and left.

296
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,472
Getting fired gives us good chance to reflect. What did we do wrong?

297
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:32,892
How could this have been avoided? As I looked back, I realized

298
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:36,604
one lesson. First. What led to this was a lack

299
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:40,740
of clarity. I needed to ask better questions.

300
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,500
Therefore, the team I led did not execute accordingly.

301
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,816
Processing this, though, took times. At first, we can get frustrated

302
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:52,276
and want to blame others. However, we need to own our

303
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:55,530
mistakes. That helped me move forward.

304
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,508
The second lesson I learned was the importance of relationship management.

305
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:03,492
As John taught us earlier, we need to continually foster our connections.

306
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:07,448
I began to reach out to my network, and the opportunities were plentiful.

307
00:21:07,624 --> 00:21:11,148
So even in something as trying as getting fired can be,

308
00:21:11,154 --> 00:21:14,924
a moment for learning. If we take time to unpack the

309
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:15,660
wisdom,

310
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,278
mastering basic skills requires guidance.

311
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:25,674
Early in my career, I worked with Wei. He instilled in me

312
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:28,540
a systemic approach that I still use today.

313
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,666
Software development is essentially problem solving, and Wei

314
00:21:32,698 --> 00:21:36,750
began to notice. Oftentimes I was trying to solve five different

315
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,480
things at once.

316
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,258
Wei's guidance was brought clear to me a few years later when I attended

317
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:46,382
a seminar at Michael Hyatt's best year ever conference.

318
00:21:46,446 --> 00:21:50,306
He discussed goal setting. Michael said, detailed plans are great

319
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:53,890
if you're building a nuclear submarine. He continued, for everything

320
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,680
else, just focus on the next step.

321
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,166
Wei and Michael agreed on this point.

322
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:04,034
Don't overthink it. In Proverbs,

323
00:22:04,082 --> 00:22:06,950
it is said in the multitude of counselors, there is safety.

324
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,286
Luke's journey first brought him to Obi Wan Kenobi, where he learned some basics

325
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:14,682
similar to what I learned from Wei. He kept learning,

326
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,140
and so have I.

327
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,338
Reflection doesn't come easy for me. I want to move on to

328
00:22:21,344 --> 00:22:25,502
the next thing. In David Marquis'book leadership is

329
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:28,734
language. He details the red work, the doing, and the blue work,

330
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:32,622
the thinking. In the book, David discusses how important they both are to

331
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:36,234
making progress. He walks us through the industrial revolution,

332
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:39,620
where the workers did the red work and the managers did the blue work.

333
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,602
Today, us knowledge workers must do both. A simple

334
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:47,142
pause can give us a chance to step back and reflect. How can I,

335
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:50,102
or we do this better. Think, apply,

336
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,030
reflect.

337
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,458
By now you're starting to think, Tom, I'm a developer.

338
00:22:57,634 --> 00:23:01,546
I don't need no stinking soft skills. Of course,

339
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:05,114
if you don't want your career to get better, keep on keeping on.

340
00:23:05,312 --> 00:23:08,566
My career path has changed dramatically as I've learned the importance

341
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:11,750
of communication, relationships, and influence.

342
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,466
Let's explore the three core soft skills. These will set the stage

343
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:18,078
for a career transformation. So remember,

344
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:21,758
coding skills got you the job. Influence will get you the

345
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:25,602
career at the code of communication is

346
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:29,220
listening. We need to listen to what is being said,

347
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,330
make eye contact and observe their body language,

348
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,390
ask good questions and seek clarity. Developers who do

349
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,600
this write better code. They don't assume they know the answer.

350
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,606
In the book, the pragmatic programmer Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas talk

351
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:49,594
about the importance of digging for requirements. We need to look between

352
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:50,570
the lines.

353
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,044
Number two at the core of

354
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:01,100
relationships is understanding their interests.

355
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,520
A few years ago, as we were potty training our daughter,

356
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,064
we were trying to get her to stay focused. Although she was

357
00:24:10,102 --> 00:24:13,196
easily distracted, she would peek

358
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:16,620
her head out the door as she wanted to watch Elmo,

359
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,400
or as she called him, Melmo.

360
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,268
Then I realized something. If I tilted the television a

361
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:26,592
little bit, we didn't have the problem. She could see the tv

362
00:24:26,656 --> 00:24:30,200
and see Elmo. A subtle change

363
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,024
helped us both get what we wanted. Sesame street was her

364
00:24:34,062 --> 00:24:37,592
focus. So both of us

365
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:39,850
were able to get what we wanted.

366
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,556
At the code of influence is connecting with someone at

367
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:49,784
a personal level. Ted is a tight

368
00:24:49,832 --> 00:24:52,956
lipped project manager. Nobody on the team can get a good

369
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:56,144
read on him. We both joined the Zoom meeting early on a Friday morning.

370
00:24:56,182 --> 00:25:00,028
When I ask him, good morning, Ted. Any plans for the weekend?

371
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:03,730
He hesitates and then says, yes. In fact, I do.

372
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,640
I'm going to show my welsh springer spaniel at the dog show this weekend.

373
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,390
I ask a few follow up questions and Ted starts to share more.

374
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,150
This short interchange helps us begin to connect.

375
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,044
Bonus time. We have the three core soft skills.

376
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:24,440
K is for knowledge. We need to apply

377
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,480
this knowledge.

378
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,448
L-U-C and K listen,

379
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:35,820
understand their interest, connect and apply the knowledge.

380
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,710
Lu C K.

381
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,700
Remember, with luck you can find influence.

382
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,720
These are the three code soft skills. They can change your career.

383
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,528
In my first role as a manager, I tried to get to know the team.

384
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:58,484
This can help build trust and influence with them. Perhaps you're starting

385
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:01,510
to think, Tom, this won't work for me.

386
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,444
AJ was a strong developer, but he rarely talked.

387
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:09,492
He worked in a slow, methodical fashion, kept his emotions in check.

388
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,964
Over time, his teammates became irritated with his style.

389
00:26:13,092 --> 00:26:16,456
I tried to get to know him. For instance. We connected on a few

390
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:19,736
things. AJ traveled to Germany to pick up his

391
00:26:19,758 --> 00:26:23,644
new bmw. He was quite excited about that.

392
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:27,500
Still, his unwillingness to communicate with others and with the product

393
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,036
owner was wearing thin. That's when my manager came to me and

394
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:34,316
said, tom, it is time for AJ to decide if he wants

395
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:38,176
to be part of the team. My manager asked

396
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:42,192
me to put AJ on a pip or performance improvement plan. I had 60 days

397
00:26:42,246 --> 00:26:45,996
to help him improve or else. Despite his strong coding

398
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:48,740
skills, his career was on a downward trajectory.

399
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,944
When I met with AJ and explained the situation, he began

400
00:26:52,992 --> 00:26:57,056
yelling at me and said, I'm the best developer you got and stormed

401
00:26:57,088 --> 00:27:00,856
right out of the meeting. The first two

402
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:04,712
weeks after this incident were really shaky. AJ wouldn't talk to me

403
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:08,036
or anyone. I kept checking in with him daily.

404
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:11,770
I knew he was an introvert. He needed his space and time.

405
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,628
Eventually, AJ and I sat down and discussed the pip and

406
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:19,532
how it made him feel. That's when I got AJ to agree to try

407
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:23,912
some experiments. We met as a team and created some working agreements.

408
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:27,468
These clarified everyone's role. Also, it stated

409
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:31,376
how we would work together. I got the product owner to give him one final

410
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:34,988
shot. In the end, we were able to give AJ

411
00:27:35,084 --> 00:27:38,896
the space he needed. Along with coaching him and his teammates, we were able

412
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:42,676
to work through it. I was able to communicate and influence the

413
00:27:42,698 --> 00:27:46,228
team using the three code soft skills and AJ was able to

414
00:27:46,234 --> 00:27:49,220
develop the soft skills he needed to change his career direction.

415
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,124
I learned how to help AJ, myself and others. You can do this too.

416
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:58,180
Coding is important, but it's not enough.

417
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:01,356
We can keep our head down and Bozo at our career, but that won't get

418
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:05,004
us where we want to go. Relationships matter.

419
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:09,000
Empathy and understanding matter. Communication matters.

420
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,408
Practicing these soft skills can give you more influence, which leads

421
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:12,890
to more success.
