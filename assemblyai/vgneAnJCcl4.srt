1
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,322
Incidents welcome to incidents,

2
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:46,640
the customer empathy workshop you never wanted

3
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,214
I'm Ryan McDonald, responder advocate for firehydrant. I am

4
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:54,766
in the delightful position of getting to chat with fire hydrant's customers and

5
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:58,174
the broader community about all aspects of incident management and

6
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:01,662
response. It's total hoot. So thanks to both fire

7
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:05,120
hydrant and to conf 42 opportunity to be here.

8
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,746
That's nice, I imagine you think, but how does someone get such a silly

9
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:13,334
job? Incidents have been a persistent part of my

10
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:16,822
professional life. Regardless of the domain, they seem to

11
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:20,026
follow me. Consequently, I ended up falling in

12
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:23,974
love with them. I started my professional life as an outward bound

13
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:27,846
instructor, leading mountaineering, rafting and climbing

14
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:30,954
expeditions in the western United States for anywhere from

15
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:34,510
22 to 30 days. And as you can imagine,

16
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,042
we had incidents. Thankfully, they were infrequent,

17
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:41,726
but when we did have them, they tended to be pretty large affairs, life and

18
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:46,158
limb emergencies, people being lost, search and rescue skills

19
00:02:46,334 --> 00:02:49,540
being required. So kind of a big deal.

20
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,490
It was great. I loved that job and I loved that role.

21
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,306
A quick joke. What's the difference between an outward bound instructor

22
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:00,390
and a large domino's pizza?

23
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,246
A large domino's pizza can feed a family.

24
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:08,074
Consequently, I caved to capitalistic urges and

25
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:12,010
ended up getting into tech. From my first

26
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,660
experience in a software outage as an intern,

27
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,206
I remember being both intrigued and,

28
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:23,870
I must confess, a little bit confused and entertained.

29
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,110
A deploy was botched and people are running around

30
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,520
trying to roll it back.

31
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,658
Meanwhile, I'm off on the side saying, so the website

32
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:38,526
is down, but nobody's dying, no one's

33
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:42,914
bleeding out, right? Transitioning from the

34
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:46,486
notion of lost teenagers in the wood compound fractures or

35
00:03:46,508 --> 00:03:50,738
helicopter evacs to this world was something that seemed

36
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:55,106
fascinating, both lowering the stakes and increasing

37
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:59,066
the complexity and sort of the interest there. This love of

38
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:02,214
interest continued as my time as an engineer in various

39
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:05,462
process roles, and formally or informally,

40
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:09,254
I ended up involved or responsible for the incidents management

41
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:13,040
training programs or other aspects of incident process.

42
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,734
I finally doubled down on incidents and ended up

43
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:20,270
as a founding member of the incident command group

44
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,786
at Twilio. My time at Twilio was amazing and

45
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:28,898
stressful and high impact and great, and over the

46
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:32,830
course of that, I had the need for an incident management

47
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,322
tool, and I was lucky enough to meet the folks here at

48
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,830
Firehydrant and as a lot of you know,

49
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,910
the time and place that you need an incident management tool oftentimes is

50
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,126
pretty stressful. So I was at Twilio for a while and

51
00:04:47,148 --> 00:04:50,806
then eventually left. Took a little bit of time off and

52
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:54,618
fire hydrant reached out and asked if I would be interested in a customer

53
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:58,266
facing role, which is not something that I had really considered that

54
00:04:58,288 --> 00:05:01,600
was not on my career roadmap or bingo card.

55
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,282
But working in customer success as a customer success engineer

56
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:09,966
directly with customers has been an enlightening process.

57
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:13,794
I've had the privilege and the opportunity to dive in with

58
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:18,100
a ton of different organizations and learn so, so much

59
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,306
with that. I'm excited to share some of that learning with you

60
00:05:22,328 --> 00:05:26,102
all. So we'll go ahead and dive in.

61
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:29,794
We'll start with a story that might seem familiar

62
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:31,000
to some of you.

63
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,846
So your day begins and

64
00:05:37,948 --> 00:05:41,466
you wake up. It's feeling like one of those above average kind of

65
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:44,954
days, right? Coffee is just like hitting you just right.

66
00:05:45,152 --> 00:05:47,660
Everything seems to be lining up.

67
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,462
There's a strong possibility of this being like

68
00:05:52,596 --> 00:05:56,746
a serious flow state kind of thing. Like real destroyed

69
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,098
the to do list kind of scenario.

70
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:03,042
So sit down, crack open your ide,

71
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:05,410
and get into your first task.

72
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,410
Not too much longer. Later, your phone buzzes.

73
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,170
Pagerduty informs you that your product has

74
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,570
other plans for your day. Remind yourself

75
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,014
it's can above average day. Things are going well. How bad

76
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:24,226
can this be? Crack your knuckles,

77
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,222
jump in and start to jump through the hoops that are required

78
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,434
to verify what exactly is happening with

79
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:35,370
your systems. You also promise yourself that you'll actually

80
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,746
check into those transient alerts from two weeks ago. But lo

81
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:42,382
and behold, after a little bit of digging, you realize this is a live

82
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:46,394
one. This is not only blowing up your pager, it's also impacting

83
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:49,678
your customers. Remembering things are

84
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:52,962
good. It's a good day, things are lined up. You go ahead and kick off

85
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:56,466
the incident management process and start investigating the

86
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:58,850
issue. You're getting real serious.

87
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,318
Out of nowhere, some rando from customer support comes literally

88
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:07,862
screaming into your chat. And you've probably

89
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:11,206
heard these questions before, right? What's the

90
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:14,546
impact like? Just getting unnecessarily

91
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:18,200
deep into something that you've only just started on

92
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,278
and at this point your chill is destroyed.

93
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:26,410
Your day feels like it's trending towards dumpster fire. What started

94
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,882
with such promise is proving to be just another on

95
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,880
call shift that you're not going to be enthused about.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,688
Thin and seen. If this sounds familiar,

97
00:07:41,784 --> 00:07:45,100
take a moment. Please enjoy this relaxing gIf.

98
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,904
Many of us with time and seat will hear this story and think

99
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:53,692
about process changes first, right? An industrial

100
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:58,348
strength racy right to clarify responsibilities.

101
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:02,096
Maybe the introduction of a new role, some kind of incident commander

102
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:05,700
type to wrangle stakeholders or serve as a firewall.

103
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,604
While one would be justified to consider these

104
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:13,572
kinds of changes, I would like to propose

105
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:16,964
an alternate take. I would argue that the above

106
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,692
story is at least partly due to a deficit

107
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:22,680
in customer empathy.

108
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,752
And if you're not familiar with the term, this is the action of understanding,

109
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:31,592
being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing

110
00:08:31,656 --> 00:08:35,608
the feelings of your customers. So that's

111
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:39,536
kind of a mouthful. And it does include words like feelings which

112
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:43,260
obviously feel like they fall into that kind of nebulous,

113
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,484
squishy side of things in our land. And why

114
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,704
am I talking about this? In the course of incident management,

115
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:54,224
shouldn't we be digging into technical solutions to high stigs

116
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:58,052
ARR compromising incidents? What can

117
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:02,104
customer empathy possibly bring to the table when we start

118
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,972
to put that into focus? In the course of our incident management

119
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:09,304
process? I would

120
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:12,716
argue quite a few things. I think there's a handful of

121
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:17,384
outcomes that we can land. So when we begin to focus on customer empathy,

122
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:21,304
I've observed the following outcomes, including improving

123
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:25,232
your customers experience during an incident, better working

124
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:28,316
relationships with other responder organizations,

125
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:32,316
and then gaining a deeper learning right from those incidents,

126
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:36,220
and better processes and product improvements from your incidents.

127
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,996
So I'd like to share with you all some concrete actions that have helped me

128
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:43,348
drive these outcomes in the organizations that I've been part of.

129
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:46,340
While none of these are mind bending,

130
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,176
I do find that when framed through the lens of customer empathy, we'll end

131
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:54,612
up landing in a few places that might not be typical or intuitive.

132
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:57,960
When you're thinking about learning from an incident,

133
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,170
let's dig in. So first,

134
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,228
missed expectations are the basis for basically

135
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:10,392
every relationship issue that's ever been. So naturally,

136
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:14,060
it shouldn't be any different with our customers or with incidents.

137
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,484
The first thing that we can do is we can get more exposure

138
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:23,824
to the product. So take some time and actually

139
00:10:23,942 --> 00:10:27,104
use your product and encourage that others use the

140
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:31,136
product as the customers might. This doesn't have

141
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:34,436
to be a deep dive. You don't need to become a power user of your

142
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,304
product, but just digging in and trying to get a sense for the basic

143
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:41,850
workflows of your product can add a ton of value.

144
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,632
And we'll get into this more later as to what that value actually

145
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:50,490
is. But if you don't have the option to use the product

146
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,084
and or there are some other alternative

147
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:57,356
routes to get that kind of experience of the day to

148
00:10:57,378 --> 00:11:01,084
day usage of the tool, you can ride along with

149
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:04,620
folks in the customer facing orgs, right? So whether that's customer

150
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,176
support, customer success user research, there are a ton

151
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:11,520
of options. All of those folks are going to have a sense

152
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,104
for how your product is being used. Common use

153
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,570
cases, and then also common friction points.

154
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,230
Whatever avenue it is that you choose to take this,

155
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,516
it really is all about just gaining that fluency in

156
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:29,796
your tool. This can be invaluable when it

157
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:33,028
comes time to serve as that translation layer

158
00:11:33,124 --> 00:11:36,570
from whomever it is is reporting that issues are taking place

159
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,170
to trying to figure out what's actually happening.

160
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,116
It can also really help during an incident when

161
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:49,404
you're trying to more acutely describe what

162
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:53,736
that impact is to a broader audience. So collecting

163
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:57,624
and displaying customer impact prominently during can incidents

164
00:11:57,752 --> 00:12:01,776
is the next thing that I found adds a ton of value. And this

165
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:04,784
is one of those things that it's nice to say, but it can be very

166
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:08,576
difficult to prioritize in the course of an incident. And I

167
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:12,112
found that trying to bifurcate efforts

168
00:12:12,176 --> 00:12:15,716
initially. Right. So the first person is digging into what maybe the

169
00:12:15,738 --> 00:12:19,524
issue looks like from the back end, and the other is trying to clarify what

170
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:23,080
that experience would be like if that were down for

171
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,916
customers. Building space into your incident response

172
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:31,080
processes to collect that customer impact and then display it can also

173
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,508
take a huge load off of responders throughout the

174
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:38,504
course of an incident. Stakeholders and other responders,

175
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,408
oftentimes this is the first question that they ask. Right. So that's

176
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:47,312
sort of the no brainer side of things. But there is also this

177
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:51,136
idea that if we keep this prominently placed in

178
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:54,080
front of everyone, that it can help frame the experience.

179
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,716
So as we add more people to the incident, the fact

180
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:01,332
that customers are experiencing pain is front and center.

181
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:04,756
This isn't a technical exercise. This isn't some kind

182
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:08,484
of logical problem. The people who pay

183
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:11,956
us are experiencing issues, and here's what those are

184
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:15,416
like. And I think centering and grounding responders in that

185
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:18,120
idea can help make the experience more relatable.

186
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,832
It also can help increase the urgency. Right. It can be easy

187
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:26,136
for these sometimes to just turn into long sojourns,

188
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:30,236
right. Trying to understand a technical problem instead of

189
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:33,544
thinking about mitigation. Right. Which is our end goal.

190
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:37,360
Oftentimes in incidents response is not to resolve the issue

191
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,864
or even understand it, but just to stop the bleeding, stop the

192
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:42,370
pain for our customers.

193
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,752
One other thing that we can do to help us understand customer expectations is

194
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:52,336
to consider something like the field of chaos engineering,

195
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:56,084
right. And what kind of value we can bring from looking at our

196
00:13:56,122 --> 00:13:59,844
application when we inject faults, when things are going

197
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,640
poorly. I'll even go so far, sometimes as to encourage people,

198
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,368
if you have downtime during an incident, to use your application in a

199
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:11,592
degraded state. Other folks can

200
00:14:11,646 --> 00:14:14,492
speak more deeply to implementing programs like this.

201
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:18,348
But really using your tool when it's not at its best

202
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:22,860
is a great way to help build and develop customer empathy.

203
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,024
So by understanding our customers expectations and

204
00:14:29,062 --> 00:14:32,864
what their experience is like, it can help us drive urgency and

205
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:36,556
ensure that we stay focused, making incidents potentially suck

206
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:40,276
less for customers. And obviously

207
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:44,420
mitigation, like trying to drive that notion of mitigation

208
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,164
is a part of that. But really, when you get down

209
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:52,008
to the dollars and cents of it, this can directly impact business

210
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:55,672
metrics. Net retention and ARR of

211
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:59,000
customers is something that can suffer if

212
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,764
customers don't feel like you understand what they're going through on

213
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,790
those bad days and are responding accordingly. Right?

214
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,772
Upsells can depend upon that sentiment. And really,

215
00:15:11,826 --> 00:15:15,196
at the end of the day, as a customer, it's hard to stick

216
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:18,716
with an organization that you don't like. Right? And feeling

217
00:15:18,748 --> 00:15:22,540
like your responders

218
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,764
understand what's happening is a great way to ensure

219
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:30,036
that customers are feeling heard and understood and that all of

220
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,710
those comms really can land for them.

221
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,928
Awesome. So our next point is to not just collaborate,

222
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:42,200
but partner with your support organization.

223
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,610
And to start with, customer support is hard.

224
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,164
In the story earlier, I wanted customer support as a boogeyman

225
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:56,424
of sorts. They emerged out of the ether to pull us from that delightful

226
00:15:56,472 --> 00:16:01,020
flow state, and that's not an entirely fair characterization.

227
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,356
Customer support is exceptionally difficult. Before we dive

228
00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:09,312
in, I've got a hard hitting analysis, the kind

229
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:12,880
that you come to these conferences for. Right.

230
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,084
I have captured an actual request from a customer facing

231
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:20,384
team during the early stages of an incident.

232
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,430
Get ready.

233
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,916
All right. Okay, so obviously,

234
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:30,650
the initial take here, this is a little heavy handed, right?

235
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,816
It's a little aggressive, right? Thankfully, with the

236
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:39,780
power of technology, we can break this down into its component parts.

237
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,208
There's nuance here if we really get into the details.

238
00:16:43,304 --> 00:16:47,112
If we look at this frame by frame, what initially comes across as anger

239
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:51,736
or maybe even aggression, we realize quickly devolves

240
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:55,408
into desperation. The fact of

241
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,928
the matter is that customer support, customer success,

242
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:03,120
or other account executives are under immense pressure during

243
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,624
incidents. They are the middleman and

244
00:17:06,662 --> 00:17:10,640
a bum deal where they have very little to no control and

245
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,840
have to serve as a sponge for customer angst.

246
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,364
So let's dig in a little bit here and see what we can do

247
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:21,000
to make some of these interactions a little bit more productive.

248
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,548
First, by proactively

249
00:17:28,644 --> 00:17:32,344
building rapport with support, you can

250
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:36,236
help smooth over a lot of these things. If you remember earlier, I encouraged the

251
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:39,928
idea of ride alongs with customer support. Surprise.

252
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:43,132
Little do you know those are rapport building activities, right?

253
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:46,944
Digging in and getting interested about their domain can

254
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:51,090
go a long way towards helping to build that initial relationship.

255
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,516
So not only that, but there's a lot of informal

256
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:59,712
opportunities, engaging with the support organization during larger events,

257
00:17:59,776 --> 00:18:03,696
inviting them to happy hours, off sites if possible, all of those kinds

258
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:07,412
of things. Another way that you can think about

259
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:11,672
how to build sort of that reciprocal vibe with

260
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:14,952
support is that you can figure, but ways

261
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:19,624
to leverage them inside of your company, outside of their

262
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:23,644
support job. So for example, are there

263
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:27,436
ways that support could be leveraged for internal or even customer

264
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,148
facing trainings? An example would be support

265
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:34,700
at Sungrid ran our product orientation.

266
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,824
All new employees were required to go through this set

267
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:43,532
of organizations where these people would do a deep dive

268
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:46,928
into how the app and why the app is doing

269
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:50,388
what it's doing. And by doing that early

270
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:54,020
and setting up support as kind of a tent pole inside

271
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,940
of the organization that really deeply understood not only

272
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,990
the tech, but the customer experience,

273
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,192
it just gave them this opportunity to be more

274
00:19:05,246 --> 00:19:08,900
available to everyone else. So we were able to build a ton of rapport

275
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:12,416
by putting those folks in a situation where they could flex their skills

276
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:15,900
just in a different context. And then lastly,

277
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,284
I can't speak for everyone in support, but support is

278
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:24,024
a great way to get into tech with fairly

279
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:26,190
limited background in technology.

280
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,476
Consequently, a lot of these folks are excited and hungry

281
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:34,304
for mentors. Those of us that have been in the field for a while can

282
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:38,452
provide an amazing resource. Just sitting down and grabbing lunch with people,

283
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:41,876
right? Chatting about what their goals are, where they want to go

284
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,556
with their career. So anywhere in that

285
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:49,604
spectrum really are all great options for

286
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:51,450
building rapport with support.

287
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,084
So once you've taken the time to get to know support coworkers,

288
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:01,604
the next thing that you can do, especially in the context of an incidents,

289
00:20:01,732 --> 00:20:05,848
is to create really clean interfaces and clear expectations

290
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:07,870
for communications with support,

291
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,260
including support and stakeholders.

292
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,388
So by setting expectations in your process for when you

293
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:18,848
will try to have descriptions of the impact to customers,

294
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:22,172
you can help avoid those frustrated confrontations

295
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:25,776
like we've been talking about. Support's primary goal is

296
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,160
to manage the expectation of customers, and input from engineers

297
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,368
is a huge currency in that, right? And helping them really describe

298
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:37,830
and empathize with customers and the experience that they're having.

299
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,032
So the other thing too to consider is once you

300
00:20:43,086 --> 00:20:46,968
set those expectations, sometimes they're hard to meet,

301
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:50,648
right? So don't beat yourself up over it, but instead

302
00:20:50,734 --> 00:20:54,308
communicate, right? There's nothing worse than having a vacuum in

303
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:57,816
the middle of an incidents. And so don't

304
00:20:57,848 --> 00:21:01,516
put support folks or customer facing groups in the position of having to

305
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:05,176
come bother you or dig into a space where you're

306
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:08,760
doing some kind of technical investigation. Right. Communicate as

307
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,432
much. Let them know like, hey, we don't have something yet, but we will,

308
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:15,904
or we'll hope to in 30 minutes, and we'll check in

309
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:19,808
sooner if we've got something. Another added benefit

310
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,992
of these types of regular communication

311
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:26,740
cadences is that the broader stakeholder group

312
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,392
can feel supported as well. So execs

313
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,016
love feeling like they're in the loop, and obviously the

314
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,504
careful dance is to keep them in the loop, but just further enough

315
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:42,840
away. And these regular communication cadences can help them build confidence

316
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,956
and avoid dropping into the middle of some

317
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:48,750
kind of deep technical issue.

318
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,956
All right, and then last here, when it comes

319
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:58,716
to partnering with your support organization, and I alluded

320
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:02,240
to this earlier a little bit, but try and let support

321
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,936
behind the curtain more during incidents, I think it's easy to

322
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,492
think about support as a stakeholder, right, or someone who

323
00:22:09,546 --> 00:22:11,030
simply needs information.

324
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,180
Consequently, they can end up feeling like they're playing second fiddle to

325
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,352
actual, like the responding engineers or other responders.

326
00:22:20,496 --> 00:22:23,892
So by bringing support closer into the fold

327
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:27,480
and engaging them in the process, there can be a bunch of win wins.

328
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,400
The only caveat here that I think is worth calling out is oftentimes

329
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,216
the models of measurement of productivity

330
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:39,496
and support can be pretty substantially different than in engineering.

331
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,180
And oftentimes that looks like something like how many

332
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,828
tickets are being passed through your queue in a

333
00:22:46,834 --> 00:22:50,480
given period of time. So I think advocating both with

334
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,176
and for support, once you understand what that model looks like,

335
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:58,388
to ensure that they have the freedom and the flexibility to

336
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:02,736
engage strictly in can incident and not be distracted

337
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,724
by other work. So really it's advocating for

338
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,788
them inside of your organization to have them brought in and

339
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:14,330
describing how valuable and how useful they can be.

340
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,276
So once you've done that and you've helped them achieve

341
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:22,104
that level of focus so that they can show up as their

342
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:24,860
best selves during that incident,

343
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,804
what can you do? How does support actually fit into the

344
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:33,932
response? Right. And I think there's a number

345
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:37,184
of different ways, not only handling tickets that are coming

346
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:40,352
in and ensuring that the correct organizations are going

347
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:43,600
out to those folks, those impacted customers,

348
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,264
but support can also provide additional evidence through

349
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,684
direct testing. These are folks that are an expert at using

350
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:54,116
the app from a customer's perspective. So by bringing them in,

351
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:57,684
you can have them test different cases, right? Which adds data

352
00:23:57,802 --> 00:24:01,416
and adds information to sort of your quiver of information that you

353
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,640
can draw on throughout the course of an incident.

354
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,472
Additionally, they can pull in additional information from

355
00:24:08,526 --> 00:24:12,660
the impacts from customers. So direct customer reports sometimes

356
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,072
can help you avoid red herrings and focus your investigation

357
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:19,612
efforts. Lastly, support can also

358
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,624
help in testing. So as you begin to roll changes out to mitigate

359
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:27,784
issues, getting them in there in lower environments

360
00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:31,504
and having them play or behind feature flags. However, it is that you all have

361
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:35,020
things set up, they can be a person to go out and verify,

362
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,128
right? Which can take some energy and some of

363
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:41,840
the attention off of your responding engineers plates.

364
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,864
There is actually a bonus outcome from this increased interaction

365
00:24:48,912 --> 00:24:51,370
and increased rapport that's being built with support.

366
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,104
They can actually before a secret hiring bench if you work

367
00:24:56,142 --> 00:24:59,556
in a high growth company, there's no end to that company's

368
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:02,952
appetite for a whole variety of roles,

369
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:07,160
including program project, product managers,

370
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,104
incident commanders, customer success managers,

371
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:14,460
even potentially engineering, right? Like more junior engineers,

372
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,320
a sufficiently senior support person can bring

373
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,624
so much domain and organizational knowledge to roles to

374
00:25:22,662 --> 00:25:26,416
like these that no outside hire could ever dream of

375
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:30,470
supplying. I have so many friends that have started in support

376
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,196
and are now adding a truly amount of mind blowing value in

377
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:39,220
an organization that they came up in and grew up in.

378
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,676
So intentionally nurturing your support folks creates

379
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,360
a pool of candidates that can lead to your next great hire.

380
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,180
So by partnering with your support organization,

381
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,952
it'll feel so much better when you meet those folks

382
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:59,848
on bad days, right? In those incidents.

383
00:26:00,024 --> 00:26:03,340
So everyone knows, right?

384
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,590
The worst time to meet someone is in a crisis situation.

385
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,408
So figuring out the nuances of how your teams work together and what

386
00:26:11,494 --> 00:26:15,040
does and doesn't work, push that. Try and start that stuff

387
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,304
before you're in the middle of an issue. The other

388
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:21,920
added benefit here is when folks feel like they're collaborating

389
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,872
and working as a team, you can have far more aha moments.

390
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:29,920
The number of times, for example, at Sendgrid, where our deeply engaged support

391
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:34,388
team would come to us with findings that helped

392
00:26:34,564 --> 00:26:37,400
our investigation accelerate their efforts.

393
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,116
It happened frequently, so give yourself the

394
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:47,224
opportunity to take advantage of these collaborative aha

395
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,844
moments of having a well oiled team instead of an

396
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,270
adversarial group.

397
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,610
And the last point here,

398
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,884
broaden your incidents retrospectives so retrospectives

399
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:05,900
can sometimes be thought of, for incidents can be thought of as strictly technical

400
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,460
exercises. If you are digging in and

401
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,992
really a root cause analysis or some technical finding

402
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:17,300
is your goal, you may be leaving quite a bit on the table

403
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,200
so here are some ways that we can help broaden

404
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,104
that idea of what is a retrospective for and how do you

405
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:30,232
use it. The first thing is making space for

406
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:33,704
all of the responders, right? So after you've engaged

407
00:27:33,832 --> 00:27:37,000
customer support as more of a responder role,

408
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,032
bringing them in to these post incident reviews or incident

409
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:45,196
retrospectives can be a great way to ensure that

410
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:48,576
you understand what their concerns are, what their experience

411
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:52,592
was like, and in turn, what kind of feedback they were getting from

412
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:56,540
customers. Right? And all of these things can feed

413
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,468
into both your processes and your product in

414
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,630
ways that you might not expect.

415
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,720
If getting those folks into a post into an incident retrospective

416
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,452
is challenging, which it is. Scheduling retrospectives

417
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:16,212
is difficult. It's hard to even get the core group of responders.

418
00:28:16,356 --> 00:28:19,320
Oftentimes in an organization that's fairly busy,

419
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,624
you can always consider doing a quick check in with them

420
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:27,084
or an async check in even, just to get a sense for what their

421
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,350
experience was like, and then bring that experience

422
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,312
as a proxy to the group of broader responders

423
00:28:34,376 --> 00:28:36,880
during the actual retrospective activities.

424
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:46,252
Next item, incident retrospectives,

425
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:49,668
plural. Right? And this can be a

426
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:53,408
bit of a hot take for some folks, but for sufficiently

427
00:28:53,504 --> 00:28:57,072
large incidents, plan in advance

428
00:28:57,136 --> 00:29:00,688
on having multiple meetings or multiple sessions, whether those

429
00:29:00,714 --> 00:29:04,484
are meetings or async exercises to cover different themes

430
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:07,530
in the course of the response. So, for example,

431
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,784
having a technical or architectural deep dive, right, like trying

432
00:29:11,822 --> 00:29:15,308
to understand the root cause, if that's a thing that

433
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:18,780
you're into, but then also

434
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,932
have a session to think, but the broader process. Right?

435
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:25,336
How did you interface in the broader organization, right.

436
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:29,648
Or potentially another session focused expressly around customer

437
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:33,424
communication? What did that cadence and that pattern look like

438
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:34,320
for folks?

439
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:42,172
Incidents, they're not optional right? Here in these complex

440
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:45,524
domains that we live and work. So taking the time to

441
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:49,364
really dig deep and learn about different ways that things are

442
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:53,124
or are not working can be key during these

443
00:29:53,162 --> 00:29:55,000
nonoptional investments.

444
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,784
So the last item here is to capture all

445
00:29:59,822 --> 00:30:02,888
of your improvements, not just the technical ones.

446
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:07,212
I think it can be easy to focus on action items to

447
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,936
make the application better or to avoid these types of incidents

448
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:14,108
from happening again. But at the end of the

449
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:18,290
day, there's a whole bunch of opportunities that

450
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,704
there are a whole bunch of things that you can take away from

451
00:30:22,742 --> 00:30:25,504
an incident that are far beyond that, right?

452
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:28,896
So, for example, how do we think about our

453
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:31,732
cadence of communication with customers? Right?

454
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,996
Are there opportunities to improve our products so that

455
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:38,464
if something like this were to happen again, that we could degrade

456
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:42,404
gracefully instead of failing outright? How are our error

457
00:30:42,452 --> 00:30:46,472
messages? Did things make sense from a customer perspective during

458
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:48,120
the course of the incident?

459
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,716
Making sure that that messaging is really good and clean and clear

460
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:57,372
and crisp can be helpful, not only for customers, right, for them

461
00:30:57,426 --> 00:31:01,372
feeling confident that something is happening on

462
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,380
the other side of the screen there when something fails.

463
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,856
But also, how can we ensure that that is a

464
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:11,856
good signal to the folks who might be raising that to people internally who

465
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:13,600
are responding to this incident?

466
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,044
So all of these things, right, whether they're small changes to the

467
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:22,880
application, changes to our process, changes to our architecture

468
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,012
or broader organizational structures, all of these things

469
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:31,780
can get loaded into various backlogs, right? And can be invaluable

470
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,252
during prioritization exercises. So engaging

471
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:39,016
folks like your PMS and tpMs, those folks that serve as kind of

472
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,324
the glue of a lot of your organization, and ensuring that

473
00:31:43,362 --> 00:31:46,748
they have a clear understanding for what happened and what

474
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:50,792
findings you had that came out of those retrospective

475
00:31:50,856 --> 00:31:53,820
exercises, can be exceptionally useful.

476
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,076
So by broadening our incident retrospectives,

477
00:32:00,188 --> 00:32:03,216
we can have deeper learning, better process,

478
00:32:03,318 --> 00:32:07,376
and better product improvements. From that,

479
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,940
I like to think about incidents retrospectives as a flywheel for improvement.

480
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,924
By considering more perspectives, especially those that are closer to

481
00:32:15,962 --> 00:32:19,664
customers, you're opening up that aperture, capturing improvements

482
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:24,120
to processes and your products that otherwise might never really have been considered.

483
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,576
All right, so we have a

484
00:32:29,598 --> 00:32:32,490
handful of actions and some outcomes we'd expect.

485
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,084
By understanding the customer's expectation, we can

486
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:40,280
create more satisfying incidents experiences.

487
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,996
By partnering with your support organization, we can

488
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:47,888
have more aligned and better responses, right, that feel

489
00:32:47,974 --> 00:32:51,420
better, that function better. And then lastly,

490
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,280
by cracking open your retrospectives, you can enable better

491
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,184
process and product prioritization, capitalizing on valuable

492
00:32:59,232 --> 00:33:02,740
and potentially expensive learning opportunities.

493
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,984
I like to think about customer empathy as an organizational lubricant,

494
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:12,224
right? Using incidents to drive this mentality

495
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:15,972
and then better leveraging your support organization can

496
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:19,684
add all manner of value. So give

497
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:23,260
a few of these actions a try and and

498
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,164
feel free to hit me up. Let me know how it goes. Here are my

499
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:30,396
socials, and I'd love to chat with you all on discord on any of

500
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:33,768
this stuff. So thank you again for the opportunity to chat

501
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:36,730
with you all and looking forward next time.
