7
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:20,870
everyone, and thank you for joining me here today at Conf 42,

8
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,450
site reliability engineering. My name is Robert Barron,

9
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,998
and I'm can AI ops and site reliability engineer

10
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:31,594
solution architect in IBM. What that means?

11
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:35,238
Iss basically that I help IBM's clients adopt SRE

12
00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:38,762
for themselves. Now, it's not very often

13
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,006
when one's hobbies align with one's professional

14
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:45,822
interests. And in this case, I'm very lucky because the history of space

15
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:49,118
exploration iss something that I've always been fascinated with.

16
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:51,902
And what I'm going to do is take you on a little story, a little

17
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:55,954
historical storytelling expedition to show you how

18
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:59,586
the International Space Station is actually very similar to the

19
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:03,106
microservices that we are developing today, except that some of

20
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:06,238
them are in the cloud and some of them are high above the

21
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:09,702
cloud. So let's start off with thinking about

22
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:13,334
why we need a space station in the first place. In the early days

23
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:16,102
of space exploration, 60s,

24
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,594
early 70s, basically, we were going out into space,

25
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:23,562
seeing what it's like, seeing what we can do there, seeing how we could function

26
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:27,162
in space. Only later, we started actually

27
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:31,274
working in space, doing things with not merely exploration,

28
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:36,030
but also productive activities that would bring resources

29
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,982
back to Earth. So this is very similar

30
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:43,554
to the early days of development versus actually getting

31
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:47,710
into a production environment and generating additional

32
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,060
value beyond what we've put in.

33
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,910
So another way of looking at it is a space mission. For example,

34
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,586
going to the moon is basically launching the spacecraft,

35
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:03,842
going through a process of deployment,

36
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:07,366
reaching our target, doing whatever we want

37
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,274
to do there momentarily, and returning very much

38
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:14,826
a CI CD pipeline of deploying a

39
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:18,474
new feature where what we're concentrating on is the process of

40
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:22,638
deployment itself and not so much on what we're doing with

41
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:26,670
what we've deployed, because in the context of a space flight,

42
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:31,646
it's done. So that's a

43
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:35,594
big difference between a spacecraft and a space station. ISS that a spacecraft

44
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:39,130
is a temporary activity, whereas a space station

45
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,622
is a permanent presence. We've got multiple crews doing

46
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:47,240
multiple things in the space station over time, replacing themselves,

47
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,166
modifying the space station itself as opposed to the

48
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:56,066
spacecraft, which is one thing that we've developed.

49
00:03:56,098 --> 00:03:59,574
We deploy and we get back. So we can look at it

50
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:02,620
as a spacecraft, as a stateless process.

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,106
You can either look at it as a CI CD process, or you can look

52
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:09,706
at as a function that is doing something. But a

53
00:04:09,728 --> 00:04:13,214
space station is a full application. It's got a lot of

54
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,506
data in it. It's very stateful.

55
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:19,934
It's something that, if there's a problem with it, we can't just say,

56
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:23,486
okay, we're going to try the next time, because we've invested so

57
00:04:23,508 --> 00:04:27,502
much in this. We need it to work. Were going to retry after our failures,

58
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:31,342
not retry from start as we did with a failed

59
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:34,986
spacecraft mission. For example, the famous Apollo

60
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:38,438
13 disaster in space, an explosion on the way to the

61
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,470
moon. They didn't recover Apollo 13 itself.

62
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,870
They replicated its mission in a future Apollo

63
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,970
mission, Apollo 14.

64
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,546
Now, if we look at the space stations, we can see that we

65
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:57,994
have at least three generations of space stations which

66
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:01,486
were developed. The first ones in the 1970s,

67
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:05,274
were monolithic space stations. The entire station

68
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:09,386
was launched at once into space. In many cases, it couldn't

69
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,894
be reprovisioned. And once a few missions

70
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:17,166
were performed, that was the end of the space station Sallyat.

71
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:22,482
Six and seven were transitional space

72
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:26,642
stations, where a central station was launched and various sidecar

73
00:05:26,706 --> 00:05:30,658
components were added, which gave additional capabilities,

74
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:34,178
especially in engineering experimentation

75
00:05:34,274 --> 00:05:36,870
and scientific collection.

76
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,986
Whereas more modern space stations, beginning with MER from

77
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:45,030
the 1980s and the ISS and Tiangyang

78
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,174
today are very modular space stations, where you construct

79
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:53,838
them in stages. There were over nearly 50 flights, both of the space

80
00:05:54,004 --> 00:05:57,674
shuttle and of regular rockets,

81
00:05:57,722 --> 00:06:01,022
which launched various components into the. To build

82
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:04,562
up the International Space Station. The modules have been moved around

83
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:07,646
to recalibrate them, put them in better positions

84
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:11,518
for whatever work they need to be done, and sometimes modules become obsolete

85
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:15,234
and are replaced. Now, if we look

86
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:18,082
at America's first space station,

87
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:21,814
Skylab. Skylab was launched using the same technology

88
00:06:21,932 --> 00:06:24,838
that got the Melkins to the moon, the Saturn V.

89
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:29,122
And it was actually the top third of the Saturn V was transformed

90
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:33,350
into the Skylab

91
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,550
space station. It was so large that they actually had space inside

92
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,390
to test a jetpack.

93
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,026
Entire Skylab

94
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:49,582
was launched once with all the scientific equipment, with all

95
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:52,882
the supplies that they needed, everything in a large

96
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:56,626
monolith, just to illustrate the size,

97
00:06:56,808 --> 00:07:00,734
the internal size of Skylab, you can see the astronauts

98
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:04,594
exercising, running a treadmill, which was the inside of

99
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,166
the space station. The problem is,

100
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:11,574
of course, that there's a lot of empty space in a space station like

101
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:15,074
this. Whereas if you look at the International

102
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:19,370
Space Station, while it iss much larger overall

103
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,294
than Skylab, famously compared

104
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:27,466
to the size of a football field, you can see that each

105
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,606
of its components is actually much smaller than

106
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:34,400
the large mask, the large monolith that Skylab was.

107
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,186
And these pieces fit together, each of them with their own role,

108
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:42,538
with their own goal, with their own targeted

109
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:45,810
mission. But each of them is, in itself,

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,742
much smaller than Skylab was. While the station is larger,

111
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:52,882
there's a lot less open space. It's a lot less

112
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:55,300
roomy than Skylab was,

113
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,322
and that's because it was developed in a modular

114
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:04,594
fashion to be brought up piece by piece, starting off with the engineers

115
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:10,022
components, then adding more and more scientific

116
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,766
and engineering exploration capabilities.

117
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:17,162
Has. Time goes by. So this is the blueprint, number one,

118
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:21,614
from 1998, where the space station started out.

119
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:24,734
The first component was launched in 1998,

120
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:28,682
and it was only completed in 2011.

121
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:32,314
This short film shows us the various

122
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:35,922
components. Each additional component that you see were is

123
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:39,698
another launch of the space shuttle or another launch of

124
00:08:39,784 --> 00:08:43,234
a rocket. And you can see that pieces are being added. Step by

125
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:47,198
step. Pieces are being moved from location to location

126
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:50,646
because, for example, the solar panels start off in the

127
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:54,438
center of the space station when there's not a lot of requirements for power.

128
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:58,006
But as we need more power, more solar panels are added, and they

129
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:01,686
are reconfigured into different places so that the station remains

130
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:05,226
balanced. And if you have time

131
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:08,666
to read the names of these components, you can see that we have more

132
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:12,286
and more scientific components being added. We have more and

133
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:14,986
more components which have commercial applications,

134
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:18,814
allowing ground based companies to add their

135
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:22,186
own explorational payloads

136
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:26,078
to the space station over time. Whereas the first components,

137
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:29,714
the original core of the space station, was all

138
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:33,970
the life support and engineering components that were required.

139
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,054
Unlike the monolith of Skylab, each of the components you

140
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:41,890
see here has a dedicated goal. It can be the Svetster

141
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,414
service module, which holds much of the engineering, life support,

142
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:48,826
and functional capabilities of the space station. Or it

143
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:52,406
can be the destiny or Columbus scientific laboratories,

144
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:56,406
which perform scientific experiments. Some components are laser

145
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:59,574
focused on specific things, such as the solar panels,

146
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:03,406
the robotic arms, or the airlocks, which cannot be repurposed for

147
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:06,938
anything else. But other components do have flexibility,

148
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:10,746
especially since the station is filled with standard payload

149
00:10:10,858 --> 00:10:14,990
racks, which means that new scientific experiments or technical tests

150
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,994
can be brought up on spacecraft to the station and replace the

151
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:22,942
older ones. It's quite remarkable

152
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:26,902
how similar a space station is today to the design of over 20

153
00:10:26,956 --> 00:10:31,238
years ago. Most of the components which were decided on in 1998

154
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:34,642
do exist in some form or another. Other components,

155
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:37,240
such has a dedicated living area.

156
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,906
Along the way, they decided that there was no necessity for

157
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:44,506
an entire component just for astronauts to sleep in, and the

158
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:48,154
astronauts sleep in various areas that they found

159
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:51,866
within the space station. I'd like

160
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:55,246
to go into a number of resiliency use cases so we can see how the

161
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:59,006
station operates day to day, and what can be

162
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,442
more natural than the oxygen that the astronauts breathe.

163
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:06,626
Just to be on the safe side, there are a number of multiple redundant and

164
00:11:06,648 --> 00:11:09,922
complementary oxygen solutions. The first one,

165
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:13,586
which is what the station started with in 1998, was based on

166
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:17,686
the 1980s Mirror space station, which predecessed the

167
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:21,186
International Space Station. It converts water into oxygen.

168
00:11:21,298 --> 00:11:24,946
However, it does have a technical byproduct,

169
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:28,874
which can cause clogging and other issues in the system.

170
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:32,730
This is technical debt that has been plaguing the

171
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,770
station since the very beginning.

172
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,926
In 2006, another system was

173
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:43,866
added called the oxygen generation system, which also uses

174
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:47,834
the same general idea to convert water to oxygen. But the byproduct

175
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,670
that's created requires a lot less maintenance.

176
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,870
And a new system from 2018

177
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,110
uses a completely different solution, converting carbon dioxide

178
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,682
to oxygen. And not only that, it can also create

179
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:07,122
more water for electron and the oxygen generation

180
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:11,254
system. So we actually see here a

181
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:14,646
progression of starting off with a system that we know

182
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:18,854
works, but has technical debt, another system, which improves

183
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:23,174
on it, and a third system, which is now eliminating

184
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:26,870
the technical debt completely, not solving the problem by creating

185
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,030
a better or simpler byproduct, but completely changing

186
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,166
the mechanism that they use to create oxygen, which means that the

187
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,906
problem not only will the problem be solved

188
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:42,320
more easily, but it won't come up in the first place.

189
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,260
When there are problems and these systems don't work,

190
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,146
then there are emergency oxygen sources. You can

191
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:55,446
see on the right here chemical bottles that are used

192
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:59,030
to create oxygen, or even simple

193
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,934
bottled oxygen, which is found in the station or

194
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:06,870
docked spacecraft. Despite a number of issues

195
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,086
with the oxygen generation systems,

196
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:12,250
primarily with the electron,

197
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,660
because it's based on the oldest technology.

198
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,086
Despite these problems, there's never been a severe problem with

199
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:24,906
the oxygen, with the health and the breathing of the astronauts

200
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:28,878
in the system. Throughout the over 20 years that it's been

201
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:32,534
working, however, there are technical debts

202
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,634
to the system. Electron is supposed to generate over

203
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:38,946
half the oxygen for the

204
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:42,866
space station, and it is very old technology. It's very difficult

205
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:46,806
to find experts on Earth who are still familiar with the

206
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:50,454
system, and also due to the design of the

207
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:54,422
russian part of the space station, where the pieces are less

208
00:13:54,476 --> 00:13:57,286
modular than in the american side,

209
00:13:57,388 --> 00:14:00,794
it's much more difficult to replace the components, which is why

210
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:04,326
the new solutions, especially the ESA solution,

211
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:06,860
are coming in and will take up more,

212
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:11,760
generate more and more of the oxygen of the station as time goes by.

213
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,518
So here's an interesting edge case.

214
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:19,786
Spacesuits used to walk in space. Every spacewalk

215
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,486
is pre planned to the very last detail, including who are

216
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:26,866
the astronauts who are going to be on the spacewalk. One of the

217
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:30,542
reasons for this is that you need to customize the two piece suit

218
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:34,254
to suit the size of the astronaut. An astronaut

219
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:38,118
might want a medium upper and a large lower, or a

220
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:41,846
small lower and a large upper or any other

221
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:45,014
combination that will suit their size.

222
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:48,262
Now, the ISS only has a limited set of

223
00:14:48,316 --> 00:14:52,918
pieces of these different spacesuits. And in 2019,

224
00:14:53,014 --> 00:14:57,126
there was a failure of a launch failure, which meant that the right astronaut

225
00:14:57,158 --> 00:15:00,714
who was planned to go on the spacewalk, didn't reach the space

226
00:15:00,752 --> 00:15:04,426
station in time. Now, they still wanted to do the spacewalk,

227
00:15:04,538 --> 00:15:07,754
but then they discovered that the scheduled astronauts,

228
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:11,422
two women, would not be able to build two

229
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,240
spacesuits in the sizes that they needed.

230
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,134
So the spacewalk was postponed again till

231
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:23,474
the right size spacesuit could be sent up into

232
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:27,074
the space station for them to build two spacesuits which

233
00:15:27,112 --> 00:15:30,850
suited them. The fact of the matter is that because most of the astronauts

234
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,658
were men, most of the spare pieces of a spacesuit

235
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:38,946
were sized larger than the two astronauts who were then scheduled

236
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:42,666
to do the spacewalk. While the image we have of an

237
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:46,074
astronaut is that of a superhuman who can do anything, we would

238
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:50,042
like to give them a hand. One of the most interesting components on the ISS

239
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:53,566
is Simon, an independently flying assistant who

240
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:57,102
can keep up with an astronaut and assist him or her with whatever

241
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:01,146
they're doing. This can range from anything from showing documentation

242
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:05,054
or a troubleshooting manual to broadcasting music for the astronaut.

243
00:16:05,182 --> 00:16:08,466
Simon can keep track of the astronaut and position itself,

244
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:12,034
so it's easy for the astronaut to read the document Simon is

245
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:15,506
displaying. Over the years, the computers we've been

246
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:18,802
able to launch into space have become more powerful, and the network

247
00:16:18,866 --> 00:16:23,046
speeds are faster. In fact, while Simon has

248
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:26,390
a powerful processor of his own, most of the work,

249
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,454
especially the AI analysis, is offloaded and executed

250
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:33,926
by Watson on the IBM cloud hundreds of kilometers

251
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:37,402
below the station. While we've discussed a number

252
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:40,974
of the technical things which happen in the space station, there are also a couple

253
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:44,240
of procedures that we should be were of.

254
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,958
Space station didn't actually start in 1988.

255
00:16:49,044 --> 00:16:53,098
It was first proposed in 1969, built it,

256
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:56,898
got bogged down in budgetary issues and political issues,

257
00:16:57,064 --> 00:17:01,220
and it was announced in 1984 and canceled in 1993.

258
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,490
And nothing actually happened with the space station

259
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,726
for decades, except a lot of talking and a lot of

260
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:12,214
money wasted on just designing in

261
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,470
place instead of construction,

262
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,894
what did work? The International Space Station.

263
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:24,134
Adding the twist of international cooperation between countries,

264
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:28,106
especially the United States and Russia. ISS the

265
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:32,634
thing that made the space station happen. It wasn't the exploration,

266
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:35,834
it wasn't the scientific advancements, it wasn't

267
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:39,422
the engineering capabilities, it wasn't the

268
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:43,058
commercial aspects and possibilities. No,

269
00:17:43,144 --> 00:17:46,740
it was the politics of countries working together,

270
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,010
cooperating and creating something jointly.

271
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,570
So to a great extent, the business of the space station

272
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,266
is being an international space station.

273
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,126
And in the same way, when we go into creating any application that

274
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:06,614
we're developing, we need to understand what it is we're trying

275
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,926
to do. We're not always trying to sell the newest

276
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:14,026
widget at the lowest price. We might be wanting to

277
00:18:14,048 --> 00:18:18,310
do something that is politically more complex,

278
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,866
which means that we need to be able to align the reliability goals

279
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:26,234
that we have to this target. For a long time, the space station

280
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:29,360
was basically supporting itself,

281
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,280
but wasn't doing much experimentation because

282
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,962
those components had not yet been launched. But still,

283
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:40,798
humans started being in the space station, working in the space station

284
00:18:40,894 --> 00:18:44,642
as early as possible, because there was value simply in being

285
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:48,646
there. The smallest things can cause the

286
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:52,582
largest headaches. Has site reliability engineers were always

287
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:56,134
conscious of the fact that we want to learn from mistakes, not just find

288
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:59,418
someone to blame, built to understand the underlying reason that the

289
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:02,474
problem occurred. Well, here's one

290
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:05,914
example of why this is sometimes difficult. In 2018,

291
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:09,430
an air leak was dedicated in the space station.

292
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,238
After lengthy examinations, the source of the leak was found a

293
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:16,858
hole in the side of one of the spacecraft which had recently docked

294
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:20,446
with the station. Now, the immediate suspect in

295
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:23,978
the case of a small hole in a spacecraft is a meteorite

296
00:19:24,074 --> 00:19:27,918
or another piece of space junk hitting it. Just a case of bad luck

297
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,842
and statistics. That's why the station can survive multiple such

298
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:35,074
strikes, and the astronauts can patch up any hole quite

299
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:37,906
quickly. However, in this case,

300
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:41,346
it quite obviously was not a random piece of metal which punched

301
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:44,806
the hole it was drilled. But how could

302
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:47,960
a spacecraft fly into space with a hole drilled into it?

303
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,746
Were are basically two possibilities. The first is that after the

304
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:56,406
spacecraft docked with the space station, can astronaut took a drone

305
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:58,970
and drilled a hole in the spacecraft,

306
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,138
or an engineer did the same thing on the ground,

307
00:20:03,254 --> 00:20:06,666
applied a patch which passed the pressure tests on the ground,

308
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:09,360
and failed a few weeks later up in space.

309
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,774
But why would either of them do something like this? It's hard to say.

310
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:17,562
Perhaps it was sabotage. Perhaps it was user error,

311
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:20,820
a slip drill and a cover up instead of a proper fix.

312
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,074
In any case, no public summary of the cause of the issue has ever been

313
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:28,814
published. While there has been a certain amount of blame

314
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:32,550
game going around in the press, I'm not going to go into any details.

315
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,562
I just wanted to remind you that while we should always try to remain technical

316
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:40,266
and detached and blameless, sometimes we

317
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,594
won't be able to remain as detached as we like from

318
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:46,780
the political processes which are hovering above us.

319
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,186
Here are some of the lessons which I hope you've seen during this session.

320
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:55,614
The first one, which we learned from Skylab, is that monoliths are

321
00:20:55,652 --> 00:20:59,358
simpler, even if they might be wasteful and more expensive in

322
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:03,594
the long term. When you choose your mvp,

323
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:07,038
it might be a spacecraft, a small, stateless solution.

324
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:10,882
It might be a monolithic space station, or it might be a modular space

325
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:14,626
station. Don't decide your technology before you decide what

326
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,154
you want to do with it. Technical debt

327
00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:21,986
is the biggest problem that we have in the industry. It's crippling.

328
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:25,666
You have to be sure that you know how to transfer your knowledge.

329
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:29,674
Don't get into the situations that the russian space agency is

330
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:33,434
today when they have virtually no one with the skills to support the

331
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,740
old electron oxygen system.

332
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,358
Remove old technology when you can, replace it with

333
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:43,854
new technology. If you can avoid problems instead of

334
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:47,262
solving them again and again, bring in something

335
00:21:47,316 --> 00:21:50,826
else that will make the problem completely disappear,

336
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:55,054
like the Europeans are doing with the new oxygen

337
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:58,180
system, which does not require water at all.

338
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,914
Lower the cost of learning. Technology is going forward at

339
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:07,602
an increasingly increasing rate and

340
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:11,380
we can't all hire only astronauts to solve our problems.

341
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,714
This is where AI can help by pointing out what the right documentation

342
00:22:15,762 --> 00:22:19,146
is, what the right troubleshooting procedures are, helping us

343
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:21,850
find how to solve problems faster.

344
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,530
The topology of our systems is ever changing.

345
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,526
No matter which diagram I show you of the International Space Station,

346
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:33,566
chances are it's going to be a wrong diagram because something has

347
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:37,342
happened in the last few weeks and in the cloud

348
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:40,622
native development. These last few weeks could be

349
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:44,058
last few seconds. Make sure that you have

350
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:47,874
redundant solutions and backups for cases when you can't get rid of

351
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:51,634
your technical debts. Be ready for something to fail and

352
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:54,740
have a solution in place to solve it.

353
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,654
Make sure you've got good resource management. You never know when you might

354
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:03,334
need a new size of spacesuit. You never know when you might need a new

355
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:07,400
node for your Kubernetes cluster or a new

356
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,180
runtime for your system.

357
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,950
It's impossible to have a completely blameless post incident

358
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,720
analysis simply because were humans and simply because

359
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,766
politics is part of technology. But try not to

360
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,902
blame astronauts, not to blame people directly built.

361
00:23:27,956 --> 00:23:31,950
Keep it as process driven as possible and remember

362
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,442
that the technology is cool, the deployed is where the fun

363
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:38,706
is, but operations and production is what

364
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:41,826
keeps the business going, gets the money coming in, makes our

365
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:45,394
clients happy and gives us support

366
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:49,160
to go on for another day and a new version of the product.

367
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:53,366
Technology ISS cool, but the business and the politics of the

368
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:56,690
business is vital. Keep up with the technologies,

369
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,074
adopt the new things that you can, but don't make it your

370
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:03,862
goal. The space station before the International

371
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:07,082
Space Station was constantly reinventing itself using

372
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:10,426
the latest and greatest technologies, but it never got off the

373
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,614
ground. So make sure that your solutions can

374
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,354
get to the cloud and beyond. Now if you deployed this session,

375
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:20,782
and I really hope you did, I've collected some

376
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:24,318
links to further reading which might interest you.

377
00:24:24,404 --> 00:24:28,242
I didn't really want to get into all the gory details of each and

378
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:31,970
every component in the space station or all the flights

379
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,394
which were made in order to build it up piece by piece.

380
00:24:35,592 --> 00:24:38,774
If you're interested in that, then you can go read more

381
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:42,546
about it. The reference guide to the International Space Station is published

382
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:46,310
by NASA. It's available online. Just google it.

383
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,042
The link is very long. I write a blog about

384
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:54,326
these things and similar lessons. Lessons from the Lunar Landing

385
00:24:54,438 --> 00:24:58,380
chateau to site reliability engineers I think there's a lot of

386
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,762
things that NASA learned in the

387
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:06,046
thousands which is relevant to the work that we do

388
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:10,046
as site reliability engineers today. There's a lot we can learn from them, a lot

389
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:14,126
of things we can inspired from them, and this is my collection

390
00:25:14,318 --> 00:25:17,854
of such lessons. NASA has actually created

391
00:25:17,902 --> 00:25:21,810
its own database, public database of significant incidents in human

392
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,034
spaceflights. Again, a link down here from

393
00:25:26,072 --> 00:25:29,810
the perspective of what IBM is doing in this domain.

394
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,666
Here are two links which will lead you down the rabbit hole

395
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,994
into a lot of further information about modern

396
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,418
service management and operations, site reliability engineering,

397
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:43,830
AI operations, chat ups, which is my favorite,

398
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,978
and so on. And one last link about kubernetes

399
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:53,134
on the space station. IBM working together with

400
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:56,622
NASA, with HP, with other partners in order

401
00:25:56,676 --> 00:26:00,202
to deploy a unique version

402
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:03,870
of cloud computing far, far above the cloud.

403
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,846
Thank you and enjoy the rest of

404
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:09,290
the conference.
