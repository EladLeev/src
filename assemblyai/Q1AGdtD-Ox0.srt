00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,630
Are you an SRE,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,358
a developer? A quality

3
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:11,406
engineer who wants to tackle the challenge of improving reliability in

native. Litmus Cloud hi,

7
00:01:17,084 --> 00:01:20,370
welcome everybody to games we play to improve on incident

8
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,194
response. My name is Austin King and I'm really excited

9
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:27,762
that you're here. This is a pre recorded stream, but I'm also

10
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:31,430
here at the conference with you and I'll be watching the chat.

11
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,450
So ask questions, share your own experiences

12
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,380
and yeah, let's try and have some fun.

13
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,242
Who am I? So I am most recently

14
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:46,400
from Amazon. I've worked there a couple times.

15
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,478
This last time for five years I worked on prime now

16
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:55,618
and other things. So recovering amazonian and

17
00:01:55,704 --> 00:01:59,806
I've throughout my career caused

18
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:03,086
a lot of outages, jumped in and helped

19
00:02:03,278 --> 00:02:07,286
bring systems back online whether I caused it

20
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:10,326
or not. And just have learned a lot,

21
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:13,606
especially from working at Amazon where

22
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:16,440
there was a lot more structure to it.

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,398
And I started coaching some teams while I was at AWS

24
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:25,082
and I've since left and I'm working

25
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:29,498
helping teams through Ops, drill and just

26
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,906
really interested in incident response, incident management and I've

27
00:02:32,938 --> 00:02:36,590
been studying the role that games play and

28
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,046
drills and practice and so I'd love to share

29
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:42,000
some things I've been thinking about.

30
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,638
So before we can get better at incident management incident response,

31
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:52,066
there are some prerequisites. So we do need

32
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:56,210
an incident management framework. There has to be some agreement

33
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,862
within your team, your ideally your company

34
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,990
about how to manage incidents and outages.

35
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,750
If you aren't here yet, that's totally fine.

36
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,426
There's some great resources at Response pagerduty.com.

37
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:15,706
They've open sourced that training and those resources and

38
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,354
then I'm also working on a bunch of free resources on how to

39
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:22,880
adopt an incident management frameworks@opsdial.com.

40
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,374
So you have to adopt a framework and then you have to train everybody on

41
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:30,570
that framework so that people understand the roles.

42
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,154
If you adopt an incident commander role, people understand

43
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:38,066
what that means from the CEO down. They understand the

44
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:41,346
incident commander is kind of at the top of the

45
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:45,010
hierarchy and in control during an outage if you choose

46
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,000
to follow that kind of model.

47
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,986
So once you have can incident frameworks and once you've adopted

48
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:55,174
it and trained folks, now we can

49
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:58,140
play games and get better at doing it.

50
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,874
So there are some foundational kind

51
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,858
of skills and attributes of a person and a team

52
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,566
that we need to build on before we can build on higher level skills.

53
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:15,722
And a lot of this comes down to kind of SRE culture

54
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:19,182
DevOps culture. In these conferences, we talk a lot about

55
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:22,762
culture. It's become much more of a focus in the last

56
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,330
decade than it was previously.

57
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,650
So the first thing is psychological safety. These ics an important

58
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,618
building block for us as individuals. To be able to function

59
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:36,120
in a team, in in a company,

60
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,606
we need to be able to take risks and kind

61
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:45,446
of raise our hand and ask questions and not be afraid that

62
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:49,690
we'll be made fun of or that there'll be backlash.

63
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,770
We need to be more comfortable with being vulnerable,

64
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,054
and we need to create the space for each other to have psychological

65
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:01,802
safety. During an incident, and especially after an incident,

66
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:05,566
if you have a post mortem or can after action review. We want

67
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:08,122
to practice blameless culture,

68
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:11,374
blameless postmortems. It's not so

69
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:15,282
much about figuring out who was wrong and who messed up

70
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:18,462
as protecting ourselves by figuring

71
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,806
out root causes and building guardrails

72
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:25,650
and automated systems so that these things can never occur again

73
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,838
because humans will always make errors. But how

74
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:32,546
do we help each other out and build in that resiliency?

75
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:36,674
And lastly, we want to have a growth culture

76
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:40,474
in our business because we work

77
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:44,394
in technology. It's all about innovation. And so we

78
00:05:44,432 --> 00:05:47,450
want to always be trying new things, adopting new things,

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,674
failing in small ways, thinking about those failures, learning lessons,

80
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:55,982
and moving forward. It's just the nature of how things are.

81
00:05:56,116 --> 00:06:00,014
This psychological safety allows us to have a much

82
00:06:00,052 --> 00:06:03,934
more enjoyable work environment and to be much more dynamic

83
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:07,682
and innovative and moving forward. And that's just

84
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:11,026
the table stakes of working in technology now.

85
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:15,266
Maybe 50 years ago, things didn't

86
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:18,306
change as rapidly as they do now, but we're

87
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,522
always adopting new technologies, new processes,

88
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:24,774
and always analyzing the

89
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:27,400
decisions we've made and kind of rethinking things.

90
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,226
So psychological safety is super important,

91
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:35,210
and it kind of leads to the next topic of team cohesion.

92
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,498
So we want to be able to give each other feedback in a

93
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:42,846
timely managers learning feedback cycles, and the

94
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:46,478
tighter they are really improve how well we can learn

95
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:50,506
and grow as a team. We want to have shared

96
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:53,982
responsibility, so we don't want a single hero

97
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,906
that's always jumping into incident response and taking care

98
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:01,486
of everything, and they can never go on a vacation.

99
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:05,638
We want to have everybody have a sense

100
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:09,400
that they own production and are responsible for it.

101
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,630
And it really helps when we have shared goals as a team,

102
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,942
as an.org, as a company, if we all know

103
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:21,130
where we're headed and we all feel responsible,

104
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,618
we're going to have much better team cohesion and things are going

105
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:28,300
to go much better. So we talk a lot

106
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,058
as sres about resiliency and systems,

107
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:35,806
but it's also important in teams. And so

108
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:39,870
psychological safety, team cohesion and

109
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,270
aspects of incident response are the human factors of resiliency.

110
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,386
How can we have the

111
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:51,778
most people helping out or being

112
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:55,350
trained up and available and have

113
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,962
practiced the skills of incident response? This is in addition

114
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:02,898
to the system level resiliency that we get through monitoring,

115
00:08:02,994 --> 00:08:05,190
observability and automation.

116
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,922
So once we have kind of

117
00:08:11,056 --> 00:08:14,874
those base soft skills in place,

118
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:19,002
these are also some higher level technical skills and

119
00:08:19,056 --> 00:08:22,430
communication, also soft skills

120
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,366
that we need specifically in terms

121
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:30,926
of incident management. Those previous skills are very portable for

122
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:35,540
any work environment, any situation, not just technology.

123
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,358
And these, when we think about incident management,

124
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:43,074
there's some more high level skills that are critical and

125
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:46,950
really important. So curiosity and problem

126
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,518
solving, these two skills are very important

127
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:54,178
to incident responders or subject matter experts,

128
00:08:54,354 --> 00:08:58,078
the SMEs who sre going in and trying to troubleshoot

129
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:05,066
and figure out what's going on, why are we having an outage and what

130
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:08,906
changes can we make to stop the bleeding for our customers?

131
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:11,950
What kind of quick band aid can we put in place to bring the system

132
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,566
back up? So curiosity is

133
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:19,102
really important to encourage. And if we can play

134
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:23,282
games that build people's curiosity, that's so much better.

135
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:27,730
I've seen teams with low curiosity, and during an outage,

136
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:32,914
we tend to accept the first hypothesis and oh

137
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:36,322
yeah, it's probably networking and not really dig

138
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:40,102
any deeper. And then 45 minutes later,

139
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:43,110
hour and a half later, we find out, oh, it's not networking. Okay,

140
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,594
now I'll start poking around. We want to always be curious

141
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:50,262
and never creating. Once we have a plan to test a hypothesis,

142
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:53,210
we're already looking for the next potential.

143
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,986
Assuming that's not the case, what else could be true and just

144
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,250
being very curious.

145
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,746
Similarly, problem solving. When we're in managing

146
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:08,542
an incident, we want to core up with a hypothesis for what is

147
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:12,014
causing the incident and then some tests that we can

148
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,830
do to invalidate that hypothesis.

149
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,894
And highly related to this ICs, the problem solving

150
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:24,980
aspect of, okay, if I think that

151
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,494
host disks are filling up, how am

152
00:10:29,532 --> 00:10:33,254
I going to solve that and being creative and coming up with ways

153
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:36,582
to solve that. So problem solving ics just super important.

154
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,186
So those two skills, everybody in the team needs

155
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,946
to have them, and the majority of people during

156
00:10:44,048 --> 00:10:47,574
incident response are incident responders. So critical

157
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:50,578
skills. The next three skills, communication,

158
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:55,278
delegation and coordination. These are especially important for

159
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,894
an incident commander or somebody running a

160
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:02,650
call and trying to coordinate and help everybody

161
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,170
bring the systems online. So communication

162
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,190
is a skills that is very challenging.

163
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,830
We often think that we communication much more clearly than we actually

164
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,520
do.

165
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,738
If two people tend to work together a lot, there's a lot of implicit,

166
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:26,726
unsaid things and these kind of jive. But once you

167
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:30,170
bring in other teams, it's just really helpful to be super

168
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,594
explicit and clear communicating. So if we can find

169
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:37,594
games that stress that skill and help us practice that skill, that'd be

170
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:41,534
great. Delegation and coordination. Again,

171
00:11:41,572 --> 00:11:45,742
the incident commander isn't the person actually doing

172
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:49,758
tasks. They're more the high level executive mind

173
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:54,222
at these time. And so they need to be delegating investigative

174
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:57,810
tasks, different types of tasks to different subject matter experts,

175
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,690
and coordinating,

176
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,090
like when will they check back in with that person?

177
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,482
So putting that all together, communication, delegation,

178
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:12,390
coordination, they may say, jane, could you look

179
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,280
at the database replication and I'll check back with

180
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,780
you. You know, do you acknowledge that? How does that sound?

181
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,026
So if we can find games that kind

182
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:29,750
of stress delegation and coordination, that could be really valuable

183
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,694
for helping instant commanders get better at that

184
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:37,358
role. So those skills are

185
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:41,086
highly portable, much like these soft skills we were

186
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,070
talking about before of team cohesion.

187
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,498
They're highly portable in that they don't depend on the type of system that

188
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:52,738
you work on. But we also have a lot of nondomain specific

189
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:56,626
knowledge that's specific to our service, our application that

190
00:12:56,648 --> 00:13:00,194
we're trying to operate. So if

191
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:04,134
you're can azure shop, that may mean that

192
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:06,470
you have deep knowledge of Cosmos DBS,

193
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,414
or if you're a kubernetes and AWS stack

194
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:15,770
or GCP, and you're focused mostly on queues,

195
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,534
the knowledge that your team has ics quite different in

196
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:24,686
those two cases. So it really comes down to the type of

197
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:28,202
service you're creating. And part of this knowledge

198
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,520
is documentation is really important.

199
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,630
And over time, filling out runbooks,

200
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,042
having lots of documented procedures for how you handle different

201
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:43,198
situations, and also eventually automating

202
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:46,390
all the parts of those runbooks that you can automate.

203
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:51,222
And these again, are really nondomain specific

204
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:54,934
pieces of knowledge. So if we can play games that help us

205
00:13:54,972 --> 00:13:58,278
drills on our actual runbooks and our actual

206
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:02,282
systems, we'll be that much quicker during an incident at

207
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,186
being able to remember what to do. So why is

208
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:10,290
it important to be good at incident management, incident response?

209
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,574
Well, poor performance leads to longer times

210
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:18,890
to recover our system. So NTTR

211
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:23,086
is meantime to recovery, although there's lots

212
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:26,638
of different r's. People also call it resolution

213
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:30,210
or remediation, but basically once

214
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,354
an outage starts the time until we can bring

215
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:38,440
it back online such that our customers have a good experience.

216
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,622
How much time does that take? And then over

217
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:47,554
a year, if we averaged out all of those incidents,

218
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:51,754
what's our mean time to recovery? So this

219
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,706
is really important because when

220
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,286
our systems are down, customers are depending

221
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:04,234
on us. So we may be losing revenue,

222
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,400
we may be losing customer trust.

223
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,270
It's not good. So the faster,

224
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,654
on average, we are at resolving an outage,

225
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:17,540
these better.

226
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,838
And we talked about some soft skills,

227
00:15:24,014 --> 00:15:27,634
some team based kind of psychological

228
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:31,202
skills. These are actually important during incident

229
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:34,726
response. There's a lot of anti patterns that happen

230
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:38,294
for teams that don't work on these skills.

231
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:41,946
For example, the bystander effect is a

232
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:45,740
well understood psychological principle that

233
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,890
if, let's say someone was being mugged,

234
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,130
there's a difference in the likelihood

235
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,640
of them getting help if there's one

236
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,218
observer or a group of observers.

237
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:04,020
So if there's one observer, there's much more likely a

238
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,322
chance that that one observer will call 911

239
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:12,226
or do something to assist. But if there's actually 15 people

240
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:16,034
that are observing this, the bystander effect is

241
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:19,654
that there's a lower likelihood that any one of them will call

242
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:23,510
911 or do anything about it, because everyone assumes that everyone

243
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,014
else is kind of on point and going to take care

244
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,710
of it. And so if a team has poor team cohesion,

245
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,362
everyone might just kind of be waiting for somebody else to do something.

246
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:38,006
In that case, another anti pattern is these blame

247
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,618
game. So can outage starts

248
00:16:41,814 --> 00:16:45,914
and a couple of people may spend the time arguing

249
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:49,694
about whose fault it was. Oh, why did you yolo push that?

250
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:52,878
Commit? It's Friday at four. He pushed it. And then you

251
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:56,242
walked out of the building. All of these things, all this

252
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:59,794
blame does not matter. What matters is getting

253
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:03,826
the system back up and helping your customers out. So it's really

254
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:07,294
not helpful to be trying to assign blame

255
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,400
and ardeo about those things.

256
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,566
So this comes back to kind of a shared goal and a shared sense of

257
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:15,590
responsibility.

258
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,394
In addition to the skills, our knowledge is also important

259
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:25,962
as SMEs. So if we

260
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:30,086
could practice our runbooks, we will find out of date runbooks,

261
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:33,934
we'll find missing runbook, we can create those and fix these.

262
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,550
If we don't have the right knowledge at the right time,

263
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,146
that can extend outages. And if you're

264
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:45,074
twice as fast at remembering and

265
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:48,418
using your runbook, it's just going

266
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:52,674
to really reduce how long it takes you to resolve an

267
00:17:52,712 --> 00:17:53,300
issue.

268
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,014
So how can we grow our

269
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:04,934
SRE culture, our DevOps culture, how can we improve it?

270
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:09,014
So I think we can do that through games, especially if

271
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:12,506
we stretch the definition of games. We're going to look at kind

272
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:16,406
of traditional video games, online games, board games

273
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:20,414
kind of things, but also stretch it a little bit into kind of

274
00:18:20,452 --> 00:18:24,030
operational exercises and drills.

275
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,474
So a lot of what we're talking about is intentional

276
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:34,046
practice and it's helpful to look at what do other disciplines

277
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:37,854
do for intentional practicing. So if we think but a soccer

278
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:41,998
team, they don't just scrimmage

279
00:18:42,094 --> 00:18:45,526
and play soccer games all the time. They spend quite

280
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:49,254
a bit of time in intentional drills and

281
00:18:49,452 --> 00:18:52,390
the coach will have lots of different drills.

282
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,190
An example would be kicking a penalty

283
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:02,794
goal kick. I'm not a huge sports person,

284
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:06,234
sorry, but if you set up the goal and these

285
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:10,182
defenders and have that one person practice

286
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:13,786
that kick at the specified distance, they're really honing

287
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:17,662
in on that particular circumstance. That does happen quite frequently during

288
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:21,726
a games and then rotating through every player and having them

289
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:25,470
do that penalty kick multiple times, that's intentional practicing

290
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,170
and getting better and better at that particular scenario.

291
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,794
Similarly, if we look at firefighters, they have an incredibly hard and

292
00:19:33,832 --> 00:19:37,734
dangerous job that ics life threatening for themselves

293
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:40,854
as well as the people they're trying to help.

294
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:44,454
And so an example of a drills that they do for

295
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:48,006
intentional practice is they will set a structure

296
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:51,366
on fire and they'll practice entering

297
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,718
the burning building safely and exiting the burning building safely.

298
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:59,494
In this way they have a controlled

299
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,654
but dangerous environment where they can really practice those

300
00:20:02,692 --> 00:20:07,422
skills and kind of have

301
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:11,390
more routine. If they didn't practice these skills

302
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,540
and there's a fire that they have to deal with every couple of months,

303
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,890
it would be much more dangerous for them without

304
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,940
not having these skills practiced and being on top of the game

305
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,370
and then looking more closely to our SRE

306
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,630
discipline, cybersecurity.

307
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,194
Actually, these play a lot of games and they're,

308
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:37,720
I think in some ways, a lot further ahead of us.

309
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,370
One example would be capture the flag. And there's

310
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,338
two main ways to play capture the flag, but I'll just describe one.

311
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:51,374
Capture the flag is incredibly popular. These are

312
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:55,422
annual organized events. They actually happen

313
00:20:55,556 --> 00:21:00,810
every week through different conferences

314
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,070
and different things. If you want to get involved, there's some great websites

315
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:09,220
that list all these ones that are happening. But basically

316
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,346
there's two teams, a red team and a blue team, and each teams

317
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:17,378
ICS given a software service to operate.

318
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:21,446
And inside of each service a vulnerability has been

319
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:25,400
placed so the teams doesn't know where the vulnerability is

320
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,366
and the games is won

321
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:32,818
by the first team that is able to find the vulnerability and

322
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:36,170
the other team and provide that and kind of capture the flag.

323
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,374
So both teams have a choice

324
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:43,966
to make. How much time do they spend hardening their system

325
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:47,646
so that the other team can't break in? And how much time do

326
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:50,874
they spend trying to exploit the other team's

327
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:54,194
system? And they're practicing all

328
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:58,126
of the skills of cybersecurity, pen testing,

329
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:02,770
decompiling binaries, looking for secrets, looking for weaknesses.

330
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,510
So it's really cool and a great practice

331
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,990
drill.

332
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,102
So I've been looking for games and looking at what

333
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:20,780
people are doing in the wild. And I've tried to organize this

334
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,066
being inspired by Maslow's hierarchy of needs, kind of the

335
00:22:25,168 --> 00:22:28,140
dependencies and how things build on each other.

336
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,118
And I think kind of the lowest layer is trust,

337
00:22:33,204 --> 00:22:36,858
bonding and safety. So having that social foundation

338
00:22:36,954 --> 00:22:40,526
is important and you can't really do

339
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:43,970
anything without that. Then building on top of that

340
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,794
is communication. It's important that everybody can

341
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:51,474
communicate during can incident. So if we could find

342
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:55,074
games that stress you do better

343
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:58,614
at the game with calm, clear speech, that would be

344
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:02,466
really cool. And then building on top of communication is delegation.

345
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:06,742
So if we could find games that focus on roles and

346
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:10,346
leadership, and then lastly, the skills and

347
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:14,598
knowledge that we talked about, how do we practice our core competencies

348
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,290
while playing a game in a gamelike environment?

349
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:22,538
And so I've been able to group the games

350
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:26,174
into at the lowest level. Party games help us build

351
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:29,742
that social aspect. Asymmetrical co op

352
00:23:29,796 --> 00:23:34,302
games. So that's a mouthful. Let's take asymmetrical

353
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:38,082
means just simply that there's at least two

354
00:23:38,136 --> 00:23:40,740
parties with differing information.

355
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,460
So there's asymmetry in terms of

356
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,542
team a or person a knows something a bit different than

357
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:53,254
team b or person b, and then co op.

358
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:57,014
These are cooperative games. All the games that we'll talk about

359
00:23:57,052 --> 00:24:01,046
today are cooperative games. And party games

360
00:24:01,078 --> 00:24:04,890
is generally associated with casual gaming and the most

361
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,506
approachable by anybody. And then when you kind

362
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:11,070
of nerd out and get into games,

363
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,326
they tend to use co op for some

364
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:18,986
of the deeper games.

365
00:24:19,178 --> 00:24:22,766
And then if we look at how

366
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:26,580
do we practice delegation and can we find any games that are great for that?

367
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,846
I think role based co op games are very handy.

368
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:34,434
And basically that means that the players have a

369
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:38,326
specialization and there's an opportunity for

370
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:41,686
a leader to coordinate and delegate to

371
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:45,830
those different roles. And then lastly,

372
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:50,698
for the skills and knowledge, I'm just going to generically call

373
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:54,486
these ops drills and we'll look at some different examples of ops

374
00:24:54,518 --> 00:24:57,882
drills. All right,

375
00:24:57,936 --> 00:25:01,950
so let's start at the base of the pyramid with our party games.

376
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:05,710
So there sre so many examples of party games.

377
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,914
A popular one right now on Steam.

378
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:14,286
I looked at some different sources. So Steam

379
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:17,970
is a video game distribution platform and marketplace.

380
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,158
Another great place to look for these is board game arena.

381
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:25,986
Both of these options are remote friendly, you can have a Zoom

382
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:29,814
call and people can play the games over

383
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:32,840
these. Steam games are often cost money.

384
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,822
Board game arena is a much

385
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:40,966
less expensive model. But anyways,

386
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:44,182
looking at the most popular party games on Steam,

387
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:48,570
Jackbox is very popular. I've played this with my teams

388
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,262
and seen lots of teams in the wild using it. It's a collection of

389
00:25:53,316 --> 00:25:57,178
party games. So there's

390
00:25:57,194 --> 00:26:00,686
a drawing game, word games. It allows you

391
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:04,542
to be silly with your teammates to kind of break the ice.

392
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:08,098
Everything doesn't have to be right or wrong and

393
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:11,746
super official and you can get to know people's preferences and

394
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:15,540
habits. So for a creating game, for example,

395
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,222
it doesn't matter if you know how to draw or not.

396
00:26:19,276 --> 00:26:22,440
If you're an artist, it's just really fun.

397
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,614
The way that drawfold will work is there's a

398
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,930
word that only you can see. You try and draw

399
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,146
an illustration of that word and then everyone is trying to be

400
00:26:33,168 --> 00:26:35,750
the first person to guess correctly what you're drawing.

401
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,238
And even if you're drawing stick figures,

402
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:43,326
everybody can have a good laugh and you

403
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:47,550
can work on psychological safety and being vulnerable,

404
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,520
these kinds of things. So party games, there's thousands of them.

405
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,890
Apples to apples,

406
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,580
trivia pursuit would be like an old school example.

407
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,186
But yeah, any game where

408
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,240
you can all play together, have a good time and

409
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,760
build up trust.

410
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,502
So moving up into the

411
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:18,730
asymmetrical co op games,

412
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,242
a great one for stressing communication. ICS keep

413
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:26,810
talking and nobody explodes. So I've

414
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,302
talked to several different engineering managers and different companies

415
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:34,282
that have used this to practicing improving

416
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:37,486
upon communication with their teams. So the

417
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:41,514
way this game works is that the asymmetry

418
00:27:41,562 --> 00:27:44,454
of information is that there's two different roles.

419
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:48,286
There's just one person that is the bomb diffuser,

420
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:51,874
and they're the only person who can see the bomb and they can see the

421
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:55,266
configuration of that bomb during that particular

422
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:59,174
session. So bombs have gauges and dials and

423
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:04,226
batteries and gives and explosive

424
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:08,610
fuel, and that can show up in all different kinds of configurations.

425
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,202
It could have three batteries or two batteries. The position

426
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:14,570
of the wires could be horizontal or vertical.

427
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,434
And the diffuser is the only one that can see it. So he

428
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:23,434
needs to describe it to the others. Everyone else that's playing.

429
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:27,514
They're the experts. They have the bomb diffusion

430
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:30,894
manual, which is a large collection of

431
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:34,642
rules. And these are kind of

432
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:37,940
logic puzzles. They're very specific.

433
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,838
An example rule might say, if there's

434
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:45,426
a yellow wire above a red wire, above a blue

435
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:48,226
wire, then cut the yellow wire.

436
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:51,746
But if there are any other colors of gives,

437
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:56,454
this does not apply. So when

438
00:28:56,492 --> 00:28:59,930
the bomb diffuser says, yeah, there's a yellow wire,

439
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,854
that's not as good of a communication as they're

440
00:29:04,982 --> 00:29:08,954
horizontally orientated. These are three gives. Going from top

441
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:14,334
to bottom is yellow, red, and blue. So if

442
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:17,966
the diffuser isn't giving clear information, then the

443
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:21,086
experts need to ask more questions. What's the orientation of

444
00:29:21,108 --> 00:29:24,606
the wires? What color wire? Ics at the

445
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:28,094
top? These kinds of questions. The repercussions

446
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:31,266
of cutting the wrong wire or trying to diffuse the bomb in the wrong way

447
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:35,074
is that it explodes. And then there's also a timer counting down

448
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:38,966
the bomb explodes. So the only way they can diffuse the bomb and

449
00:29:38,988 --> 00:29:42,946
win the game is to carefully and clearly communicate

450
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:46,386
back and forth and give really clear instructions.

451
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:49,450
Okay, cut the yellow wire,

452
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,370
and the day is saved.

453
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,974
So that is asymmetrical co op games

454
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:01,422
to help us with communication. And then next

455
00:30:01,476 --> 00:30:05,150
up on top of that, in terms of delegation and communication

456
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,422
is role based co op games. And so a great

457
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:12,590
one here is overcooked.

458
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,902
My understanding of where the word chef

459
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:21,442
cons from ics, it's a french word, chef de

460
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:25,390
cuisine, which roughly translated

461
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,110
as the leader of the kitchen. These boss of the kitchen.

462
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:33,560
And so this is a great example of

463
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,330
leadership and delegation. The way overcooked works

464
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,926
is there's different cooking stations in a kitchen, and you're

465
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:45,146
trying to make food for customers under some

466
00:30:45,168 --> 00:30:48,422
time pressures. There's a dishwashing station,

467
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:52,058
there's a vegetable chopping station, there's a grilling station,

468
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:56,138
and then there's a window so that you can deliver the finished plate

469
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,800
to your customers. So early on,

470
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,474
there's no forced roles. Anybody can

471
00:31:02,532 --> 00:31:05,986
do any station. And early on, there isn't a lot of

472
00:31:06,008 --> 00:31:09,266
stress. There's plenty of clean plates, things sre

473
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:11,650
moving along. But eventually,

474
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,070
due to time pressure and using up resources,

475
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,622
a leader needs to be

476
00:31:21,676 --> 00:31:24,886
assigned so that they can look at the different resource bottlenecks and

477
00:31:24,908 --> 00:31:27,682
anticipate things. If there's no clean plates,

478
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:31,162
you can't plate the food, and so you can't give it to the customer.

479
00:31:31,296 --> 00:31:35,974
So it's very helpful for a chef to step up and delegate

480
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:39,146
and know. Bill, could you go over to

481
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:43,210
the dirty dishes and clean five dishes

482
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,510
before returning back to the cutting station.

483
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,254
And it turns out in the game, just like real life, nobody wants

484
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:53,674
to do dirty dishes. So the team

485
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:57,758
that does kind of have an incident commander type role

486
00:31:57,934 --> 00:32:01,854
will do much better at overcooked and get further

487
00:32:01,982 --> 00:32:05,554
compared to a team that just has no plan and it's just chaos

488
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,990
and everybody's trying to do every role.

489
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,586
So lastly, that brings us to the general bucket

490
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:17,094
of ops drills. So can we play games within our

491
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:20,746
teams, in our particular team, and even across the

492
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:24,090
or across the company to get better at

493
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,138
the incident management, incident response skills, and especially

494
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:31,534
drills on our particular systems and our

495
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:35,614
particular runbook and knowledge? So I

496
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:38,766
have four different games that

497
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:42,554
we can play, and first

498
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:46,814
up is tabletop exercises. So we talked about cybersecurity earlier.

499
00:32:46,942 --> 00:32:51,010
This is very popular in cybersecurity, and it comes from

500
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,986
the government, the military,

501
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:59,490
and FEMA, for example. They deal with natural disasters.

502
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,802
They have a long history of tabletop exercises.

503
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:07,190
So what a tabletop exercise is, there's very little equipment

504
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,002
in a remote. First way, you just need

505
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:16,010
someone to think up a scenario,

506
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,118
then a Zoom call, and then maybe

507
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:24,910
a document or a slide show just to give people

508
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,430
the scenario,

509
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,594
and then a plan of who should be at that meeting.

510
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:35,106
And then an hour or two or six, depending on how deep you

511
00:33:35,128 --> 00:33:39,134
want to go for people to talk through how they would respond

512
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:42,418
to that particular scenario. On the

513
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:45,874
cybersecurity side, there's a really cool deck of cards

514
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:49,826
called backdoors and breaches. And that really helps

515
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:53,894
stimulate creativity in terms of coming up with

516
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:57,414
the incident. But within your team,

517
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,698
you could just have somebody that's more senior and has experienced a

518
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:04,534
lot of things come up with the tabletop scenario.

519
00:34:04,662 --> 00:34:07,978
And they're kind of like the dungeon master, if we think of this as like

520
00:34:08,064 --> 00:34:12,462
DND. So they could say

521
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:15,854
that all

522
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:19,646
of the videos that customers

523
00:34:19,748 --> 00:34:23,810
are uploading are not getting encoded

524
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,034
to a proper codec, and they could think through some

525
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:31,282
of the root causes for that. And then

526
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:35,222
everybody in the room that normally works on this

527
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:39,894
video subscription service or

528
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:43,894
video platform could talk through things

529
00:34:43,932 --> 00:34:47,046
they would check things they would do.

530
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:50,694
And this can help highlight missing metrics,

531
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:54,166
missing observability monitoring. Could be existing

532
00:34:54,198 --> 00:34:58,826
runbooks, and so you can file tickets to go

533
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:02,446
back and kind of fix those things. So the benefit is

534
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:05,040
that you don't really need any buy in from anybody.

535
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,990
And the con

536
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,246
of it is that it's not as realistic. You're not actually executing

537
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:16,340
any software or actually testing your system.

538
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,706
One benefit of tabletop exercises is you

539
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:24,546
might want to try broadening the invitation list

540
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:28,054
much larger than you would normally think about. It can be really

541
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:31,030
helpful to involve executives,

542
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,650
legal and marketing people, just picking

543
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,878
one or two people from each of those disciplines.

544
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:42,570
But for example, with executives,

545
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,982
it can help executives see how the engineering

546
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:51,850
teams teams with outages and incident management

547
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,394
to help develop a rapport and to give them an understanding

548
00:35:56,442 --> 00:36:00,670
to see how the sausage is made. If they're never involved,

549
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,494
then when there's a real outage, they may

550
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:08,402
not have trust in engineering, they may not have an understanding of how

551
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:12,126
systems get back online. And so they might join a Zoom

552
00:36:12,158 --> 00:36:15,390
call and make demands or try and take over the situation,

553
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,222
not really understanding how incident management should

554
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:23,186
work. But if they're involved in these tabletop exercises,

555
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:27,560
they'll really develop a rapport and see the thinking,

556
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,230
all of the advanced preparation that's already happened for all your systems,

557
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,260
and just they'll have more confidence and more buy in.

558
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,478
So when you're trying to get operational

559
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:43,162
work and automation prioritized against feature

560
00:36:43,226 --> 00:36:46,526
work, you'll have a better chance at getting a

561
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:50,110
better ratio. If you work on a product

562
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,710
where features are always prioritized over operational

563
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,530
work, that would be really important and helpful to

564
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,354
avoiding toil or putting in guardrails to

565
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:05,090
make the next outage less likely,

566
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,414
the more alignment you have in your organization. This can really

567
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:12,550
help similarly legal and marketing.

568
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,134
If you have an outage scenario where you've lost

569
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:21,754
all customer data for the last three months and the

570
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,540
backups turned out to not work,

571
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,934
that can be great to have legal and marketing

572
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:32,160
in the room so that they can think about

573
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:37,150
aspects of their workflow and

574
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,526
projects that they have planned to kind of

575
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:44,420
get ahead of some of these things and to think through how

576
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,642
the terms of service are written and

577
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:52,434
promises that are being made to customers and things like

578
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:55,650
that. So that's tabletop exercises,

579
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,846
and it's all verbal and hypothetical. So we can

580
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:06,470
kind of move into fire drills, which is a little bit more realistic.

581
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,266
And there's different ways to do fire drills. So one example

582
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:16,490
would be to pick one of your runbook

583
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,120
and page the person that's on call

584
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,974
and create a ticket and

585
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:28,494
describe that they need to run through that

586
00:38:28,532 --> 00:38:31,886
runbook and do all the steps and then put as

587
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:35,362
much information into the ticket as possible. So this

588
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:39,170
would be kind of testing that particular runbook,

589
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,406
building up the muscle memory of knowing these. It is what's

590
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:47,702
in it, executing all the steps, and you could potentially find

591
00:38:47,756 --> 00:38:50,760
bugs that's out of date and fix those.

592
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,602
Another type of fire drill in staging,

593
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,890
or maybe even production, would be to

594
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,518
intentionally break one node

595
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:06,486
or some percentage

596
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:09,610
of a system in a particular way.

597
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,978
And that would test that your alarming

598
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:17,760
is working, that the person would get paged in,

599
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,562
that they could practice investigating and remediating

600
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,326
that situation, and kind

601
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:29,600
of bringing the system back online, or failing over into

602
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,400
redundant capacity, or just testing that the automated failover is happening.

603
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,886
So lots of different ways to

604
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,230
do fire drills.

605
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,182
Some downsides or limitations of fire drills might be that

606
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:50,126
you don't have pager duties hooked into staging,

607
00:39:50,178 --> 00:39:54,230
and you don't have all your observability and monitoring hooked into staging.

608
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,226
So you'll want to work on fixing that.

609
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,930
And these sre things you might want to do anyways.

610
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,906
So it's a little higher fidelity than tabletopping,

611
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:08,970
but it does require more work and more engineering commitment,

612
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,870
which might be hard to get prioritized.

613
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,590
And the idea of a fire drill leads us naturally

614
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,930
into chaos testing, which ICs, a more

615
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,730
disciplined version of fire drills.

616
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,026
And Netflix is famous for chaos testing

617
00:40:29,058 --> 00:40:32,758
their systems in production. And a company that

618
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:36,210
really chaos a lot of training and help for this ICS Gremlin.

619
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,950
But there's also a lot of open source chaos testing projects.

620
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,402
But effectively, you could set

621
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:48,554
up a chaos testing hypothesis and

622
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:52,458
attack a system either in development, staging, or prod.

623
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:55,120
And to make more of a game of it,

624
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,566
you could treat it more like a fire drill, thinking about having the

625
00:40:59,588 --> 00:41:03,360
team respond to it, diagnose it,

626
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,506
and do the recovery. And this can help you come up

627
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:11,486
with a roadmap for automations and fixes

628
00:41:11,518 --> 00:41:14,734
to the system to kind of make this

629
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,790
not need human intervention.

630
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:21,590
And this may also help you

631
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,602
if you want to adopt chaos testing, as can organization long term,

632
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:29,270
and just kind of continuously having this run in the background,

633
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:34,422
doing this in a more game teamlike fashion, could be an incremental

634
00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:37,130
stepping stone towards chaos testing.

635
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,640
And then lastly, ICS game days.

636
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,938
So these are typically done in production,

637
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:48,798
more big scary events. They probably

638
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:52,666
happen less frequently than something like chaos testing

639
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:56,066
or fire drill. Myself,

640
00:41:56,248 --> 00:42:00,018
the first time I was involved in a game day was in

641
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:03,070
2008. I was working at Amazon,

642
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,238
on the retail website, and at 1030 in the

643
00:42:07,244 --> 00:42:10,902
morning, I got paged. We didn't know anything about this game

644
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:14,150
day, and they had decided to cut the power

645
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,550
to an entire building on purpose, to see, to stress

646
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:21,930
test our systems and to make sure everything was redundant,

647
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,282
company wide. So this was actually

648
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:31,162
my first day of being on call, and I was

649
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:35,038
a new employee of like two months, so I was completely

650
00:42:35,124 --> 00:42:38,366
freaked out I totally from. Luckily my mentor was

651
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:42,254
sitting next to me and these kind of took over and helped me walk through

652
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,618
it to fail over

653
00:42:45,704 --> 00:42:48,942
into other regions. So that was pretty exciting.

654
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:53,714
Introduction to game days another example of game day at

655
00:42:53,752 --> 00:42:57,320
Amazon is to prepare for Prime Day.

656
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,720
There will be one core game days,

657
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,102
so I was involved in at least

658
00:43:06,156 --> 00:43:09,674
one of these and there were a lot more planning and

659
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:12,922
broadcast information. So we did have a heads up

660
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:16,442
about these. The trouble with Prime Day is that

661
00:43:16,576 --> 00:43:20,778
the traffic patterns are completely different than normal

662
00:43:20,954 --> 00:43:24,842
retail shopping. They stand up, unique catalog

663
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:28,766
experiences, the user flows are completely different and you kind of

664
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:33,958
have this peak traffic problem where everybody's

665
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:39,042
going to the Nintendo Switch or whatever the cool thing is every

666
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:42,594
hour they may have some product that's just going to get an insane amount

667
00:43:42,632 --> 00:43:46,134
of traffic and that type of

668
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:49,574
thing doesn't happen for most of the rest

669
00:43:49,612 --> 00:43:53,302
of the year. So there's a lot of unique core

670
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:56,742
and feature flags that are built

671
00:43:56,796 --> 00:44:00,730
to handle these situations so that you can have some fallback

672
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,454
experiences and then you have the permutations

673
00:44:04,582 --> 00:44:08,186
of all of those toggles for all those different systems. So a

674
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:11,742
game day of simulating that traffic and

675
00:44:11,876 --> 00:44:14,986
turning on and off these different feature flags

676
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:18,400
ics really helpful for shaking out bugs in a system and

677
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:22,598
finding problems. So hopefully

678
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:26,226
that's given you some ideas of how you can play

679
00:44:26,328 --> 00:44:28,530
more games with your teams.

680
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,014
And again, being more remote

681
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:38,230
first. You can go to steam, you can go to board game arena,

682
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,710
and I'm putting more ideas up on opsdrillcom

683
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,758
if you want to check that out. But I would just encourage everybody,

684
00:44:46,924 --> 00:44:51,020
especially if you're shifting to remote first.

685
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,362
It's just really hard to join a new team these days and

686
00:44:56,496 --> 00:44:59,660
to get to know people and

687
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,798
playing games with teams once a month

688
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:08,766
or weekly can just do so much

689
00:45:08,868 --> 00:45:12,174
for building that team cohesion and helping people

690
00:45:12,212 --> 00:45:15,566
get to know each other. So that's pretty much it

691
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:19,550
for me. Thank you so much for taking the time to

692
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,894
join this talk with me. If you want to.

693
00:45:22,932 --> 00:45:26,182
I'm on twitter at please follow me.

694
00:45:26,236 --> 00:45:29,606
My dms are open. Additionally, my email address is listed right

695
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:33,718
now. Love to hear from you, your ideas, your thoughts and
