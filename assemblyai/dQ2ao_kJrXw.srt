00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,110
Hello and welcome to conf 42. Today we will discuss

2
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,702
about quant quantum sensors, how it will

3
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:30,920
revolutionizing the traditional GPS technology.

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:36,258
And I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science

5
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:40,154
at Asan Institute of Science and Technology. You can

6
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,500
connect me in LinkedIn. I am just one message away.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,602
What is quantum sensors? Quantum sensors are

8
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:54,506
an advanced sensor technology that detects

9
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:58,574
the change in motion, force, electric and

10
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:02,486
magnetic field by collecting data at atomic

11
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:06,370
level. So why we need quantum sensors?

12
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,194
The quantum sensors are more

13
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:14,922
precise and accurate than the traditional sensors

14
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:19,750
and there are many disadvantages of traditional sensors

15
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,602
utilize the properties of quantum mechanics

16
00:01:23,746 --> 00:01:28,390
such as quantum entanglement, quantum interference

17
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,646
and many more. Type of quantum sensors

18
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:36,506
there are many type of quantum sensors, but mainly it

19
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:39,942
is used to precisely

20
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:43,130
measure the acceleration force,

21
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,150
magnetic and gravitational fields.

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,706
Quantum accelerometer the quantum accelerometer

23
00:01:51,818 --> 00:01:55,534
uses ultracooled atom to make a highly

24
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,650
accurate measurement. When it cooled to

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,630
extremely low temperature, the atom starts to display

26
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,666
quantum nature, resulting in wavelike

27
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:11,622
properties. As the atom moves the

28
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:15,590
sensors, an optical rule.

29
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,802
We can measure the acceleration by

30
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:23,818
using the optical rule. It will

31
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:27,462
be more accurate than the traditional sensors.

32
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:31,934
The quantum compass most navigation today

33
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:35,182
relies on global navigation satellite system,

34
00:02:35,316 --> 00:02:39,214
also known as GNSS such

35
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:42,726
as GPS which sends and receive the signal

36
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,410
from satellite orbiting the earth.

37
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,490
But the quantum accelerometer is self

38
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,394
contained system that does not rely on

39
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:57,830
any external signals. It is independent

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,270
navigation using quantum accelerometer.

41
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,050
The navigation using a quantum accelerometer

42
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,060
we need precise starting position

43
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,522
and by using the quantum accelerometer we

44
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:18,410
can measure the acceleration very precisely.

45
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,554
So we can use this port data to determine

46
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:26,000
our position in 3d space.

47
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,970
Traditional navigation system versus

48
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,250
navigation using quantum sensors to navigate using

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,706
global positioning system which is also known as

50
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:43,486
GPS, we need external source like satellites

51
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:47,990
and for precise measurement we need four

52
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,534
to five satellites. Because of all

53
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:55,862
this, it is quite

54
00:03:55,996 --> 00:04:00,060
expensive and it depends on

55
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,262
external source. That's why it's easy to jam

56
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:08,186
and hack. This will not rely on

57
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:12,062
any external source. Because of that, it will

58
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:15,886
give more accurate navigation and

59
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:18,880
it's quite difficult to hack it.

60
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,054
What is the progress? The UK's first quantum

61
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:27,118
accelerometer for navigation has been demonstrated

62
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:31,486
by the team of Imperial College London. A prototype

63
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:35,574
of quantum sensors built at Imperial will be

64
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:39,474
applicable in GPS free navigation

65
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:43,430
has been tested in collaboration with Royal Navy.

66
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,686
So we are getting progress in

67
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:51,186
the GPS free navigation

68
00:04:51,298 --> 00:04:54,694
system. But the quantum sensors are

69
00:04:54,732 --> 00:05:00,074
quite big. So this is the disadvantage

70
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:04,926
of quantum sensors. But the advantage is it

71
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:08,670
is more accurate than our GPS systems.

72
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:09,660
Thank you everyone.
