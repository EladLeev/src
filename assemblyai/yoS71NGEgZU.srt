1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,546
Everybody, you welcome to my talk. And my name is Akwemiko Dsu

2
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:31,960
and I'm really excited to be doing this with everybody right here.

3
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,878
Really excited to be having this talk today because it's my first in a

4
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:39,526
very long while and here I am doing what I love

5
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:43,446
to do again and find it really exciting, very interesting

6
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:46,630
stuff to do today.

7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,730
I'll be talking about something really cool, but before then I'm

8
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,606
super excited because this is my very first talk in the past

9
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,462
one and a half year already, and really

10
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,390
excited to be doing this in this kind of event. I mean,

11
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,794
conf 42 Engineering Chaos 2024.

12
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:09,650
Very excited to be doing this with everybody alongside the other amazing

13
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,186
speakers doing this. And I really want to give a

14
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:16,982
round of applause to everyone who organized these events and

15
00:01:17,036 --> 00:01:19,640
making things work out together here.

16
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,318
So here in this talk,

17
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,902
it's going to be fascinating and it's really

18
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:29,990
great talk for people love to use react

19
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,642
and then explore so many different technologies that works around

20
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,222
react and different tools

21
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:40,542
for accessibility with react and all that kind of stuff.

22
00:01:40,596 --> 00:01:43,902
Yeah, I think this talk is for you if you're looking to

23
00:01:43,956 --> 00:01:47,642
put out something real good for creating

24
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:51,402
stuff seamlessly, I mean, react application seamlessly.

25
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:55,460
So yeah, we would love to

26
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,730
now get into the next part of this talk.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,826
And yeah, here's just a bit information

28
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:07,270
about myself. My name is Okamiko, I'm just 18 years old

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,534
and this is something I've been doing for, I mean,

30
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:14,214
keynotes speaking. It's just been something I've been doing for the past

31
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:18,070
four years. And I am

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,546
just 18, like I said. And I have

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,938
been a devil practitioner since the past four years already.

34
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:30,218
And one X IBM champion for developers in 2021

35
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:34,462
of the youngest at the point, and also started

36
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:37,966
coding at the age of eleven. Then I transitioned into devil at the

37
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:41,454
age of 14. But I really do write a lot of

38
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:44,786
code. I'm a very big fan of react next and

39
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:49,374
I'm a very big fan of them. And these are technologies

40
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:54,050
I use in my day to day life. And I

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,960
really do not have a life outside of tech, as people say.

42
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,034
I mean, my friends tell me I don't have particularly

43
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:05,720
a life outside of tech, which is something I think I find very interesting

44
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,314
because this is what really keeps me fun. And yeah,

45
00:03:10,352 --> 00:03:14,054
you can find me on any social media core of Lagos

46
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:17,754
is in the Andu Koda of Lagos and on LinkedIn. You can check

47
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:21,214
me open. And yeah,

48
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:25,146
I'm nigerian and I'm an unemployed devil. So if you're

49
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:28,398
potentially looking for a devil I can be one

50
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:31,630
for you to hire. So yeah,

51
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,490
let's get into the main stuff for today and before

52
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,154
you get into this talk, before listening to this talk, I mean there are

53
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:44,082
definitely some things you have to know and these are really

54
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:48,326
important things like crucial stuff like you need to know before or

55
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:52,626
while listening to this talk. You need to have a basic

56
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:56,086
knowledge of JavaScript, how to use JavaScript, and not

57
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:59,642
just how to use Javascript but architecture and all those kind of stuff

58
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:03,322
like how it really works and just the basic things.

59
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,222
And you also need to have some experience with using react

60
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:11,254
libraries like Chakra Ui or CSS libraries

61
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:14,010
like Chakra Ui, Towind,

62
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,338
buluma, all this kind of stuff like everything, not essentially

63
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:23,074
everything, but you can just pick one to work with because in

64
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:27,230
mysmuild you can use any CSS

65
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,334
library to you can work with any CSS library,

66
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:34,174
literally. And also Javascript

67
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:38,342
libraries like react in this context. You need to know how

68
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:41,970
it works, how to use this, because it's really essential

69
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:47,846
to be very honest. And that

70
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:51,446
takes us to the next thing which we have is the key points from

71
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,794
this talk. Like what are you going to learn from this talk? I mean in

72
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:57,994
your head you may be wondering, okay, what am I going to take off this

73
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:01,118
talk, what am I going to do after listening to this

74
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:05,118
guy and stuff like that? But first thing is

75
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:08,814
you're going to learn about the architectures of

76
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:10,800
Mysmail, how it was built,

77
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,906
where everything runs on like the basic

78
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:19,294
components that makes up mytmail, just everything entirely

79
00:05:19,342 --> 00:05:22,754
like on the interface or like the

80
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,874
visual development environment which I call

81
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:29,606
the studio. And also you'd get to learn what you

82
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:33,346
can actually do when using mighty mail.

83
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:36,390
Like what can you build using mighty mail and all that kind of stuff.

84
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,414
So yeah, that is really all about this

85
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:44,726
in this context. And yeah, let's get to

86
00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:47,866
the next. So I mean you may be wondering, I've been talking about

87
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:52,134
mighty mailed. Mighty mailed, mighty mail. What is mighty mailed?

88
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:55,726
What is really mighty mail? So mighty mailed is

89
00:05:55,748 --> 00:06:01,950
actually visual development tool for

90
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,918
building react applications seamlessly.

91
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:08,946
Because in this context you don't have to write code, it's what you build is

92
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:12,786
what you get. So what you really have

93
00:06:12,808 --> 00:06:16,446
to do is just do your things on your own and just

94
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,670
drag and drop edit the components, this and that.

95
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,382
That's all you have to do when you're using Mightymeld. So it's actually used

96
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:26,646
by react developers or I mean

97
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:30,858
people who don't even have prior experience using

98
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:34,154
react. So it's brought so much

99
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:37,754
accessibility that even if you understand react or even if you

100
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:41,306
barely even understand react, you can actually use it because it

101
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:44,734
doesn't need you to understand all

102
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:48,538
that code and stuff. But I mean, you need to understand the framework you're

103
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:51,694
working with. You need to understand that 100%.

104
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:55,626
And so you don't just make mistakes. So here's

105
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:59,086
the next thing. These are just the basic things that makes up Mightymeld mail.

106
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:02,930
And now we're getting our hands really dirty into the entire

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,206
architecture of Mightymeld mail because there are three things that makes up mighty mail.

108
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:10,006
And let's just find out. First is the studio. The studio, I call it

109
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:13,622
the visual development environment. And I mean, you still

110
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:17,698
get to learn a lot about that in this talk. The next is also describe.

111
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:21,690
And in this context we're talking about describe as one of the major

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,450
parts of Mighty Mail. I mean, with the scribe,

113
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,250
it's just the main part of everything, India architectures and

114
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,754
also the envoy. Envoy is also very essential,

115
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:37,578
but not as essential as scribe is in this context.

116
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,906
And yeah, like I said, first thing we'll

117
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:44,350
start with scribe. Scribe is the art of

118
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,126
the entire, like Mightymeld mail architecture. Because without describe,

119
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:51,746
communication won't flow well. Without describe, so many

120
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:55,586
things won't work well. And I mean, scribe is

121
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:59,326
in control of, it's just in charge of code generation

122
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:02,806
and updates. When you make a component, when you drag and drop a

123
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:06,738
component and you try to edit and all that kind of stuff, it's all undescribed

124
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:10,794
to actually edit or, sorry, it's all undescribed to actually make so many

125
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:15,180
updates locally and do all that kind of stuff. Then next

126
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,126
it's just the main parts of the project, like adds

127
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:22,378
communication with the envoy and sends the communication directly

128
00:08:22,474 --> 00:08:25,726
to the studio. So everything is all on scribe in terms of

129
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:28,240
communication and the main part of the project.

130
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,140
Now we have envoy, which is literally like very

131
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,394
one of the most crucial parts. But I don't think as crucial as

132
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:41,154
scribe. But when you're talking about architecture, you don't leave any

133
00:08:41,192 --> 00:08:46,626
part of architecture behind because you

134
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:50,046
don't leave any components behind, rather because you have like

135
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:53,446
three different things in this context and one can do without one and one can

136
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:57,174
do without one. But what I'm just trying to say is scribe, in my

137
00:08:57,212 --> 00:09:02,394
opinion, is what I feel like is the most important

138
00:09:02,512 --> 00:09:06,586
out of the three. The envoy also provides like

139
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:09,766
mysmail plugin and all that kind of stuff, but it's

140
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,366
also really essential. And without this, you can't even launch

141
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:17,146
your application. You can't manage your application very well because this is actually in charge

142
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:20,606
of all these things. And without the envoy, you won't actually see so many

143
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:24,174
things working well. You won't see so many things working well in terms

144
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,662
of like the mytemail plugin. Without the envoy you don't get the mysmail plugin.

145
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:31,346
And which, if you don't have all these things, you can't launch your

146
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:34,722
application. Your application will start well, it won't start at all.

147
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:37,842
And yeah, that's just the basic thing about the envoy.

148
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:41,654
And so next, let's just get

149
00:09:41,852 --> 00:09:45,574
our hands like a bit dirty, not even a bit dirty, but I mean

150
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:49,254
very dirty, but not for too long. So thank

151
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:52,882
you. So here is just some more explanation

152
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:56,390
on the studio and the envoy. Sorry, and describe an envoy.

153
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,054
And of course, the envoy is literally lightweight

154
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:03,662
because it has a lot of responsibilities in it, but it was actually

155
00:10:03,716 --> 00:10:08,270
compressed, it was actually compressed to be lightweight because of so many responsibilities

156
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,094
on it. Right. I mean, the hand boy just make

157
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:16,340
things real seamless for its users and provide

158
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,986
great user experience and developer experience for its

159
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:23,714
users. I mean, it was compressed to be lightweight. And this actually works

160
00:10:23,752 --> 00:10:27,594
directly with the scribe to send communication directly also to the studio.

161
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:31,718
And this scribe, as I've always said,

162
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:35,206
serves as the functionality of the entire project. Without the scribe, this is

163
00:10:35,228 --> 00:10:38,918
not working. That is not working in terms of the functionality and in

164
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:42,602
terms of code generation and this and that, everything is not really working.

165
00:10:42,736 --> 00:10:46,134
So scribe's communication

166
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:49,958
with envoy actually relies on just two things for the communication.

167
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:53,642
It relies on HTTPs and secure sockets in this context.

168
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,738
And these things are just used for the communication

169
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:01,214
between scribe and envoy. Right, in this

170
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:05,300
context. So that is just it. And like I said earlier on,

171
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,362
this envoy has something really attached to it, and the only thing

172
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,430
attached to it is the browser API,

173
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,860
which is directly in the plugin and all that kind of stuff.

174
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,798
But let's just move into the next part. And as you

175
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,634
can see, the studio is what I literally call like the visual development

176
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:27,398
environment. And without this, you are not seeing anything related to

177
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:30,550
my email. And to be honest, in this context,

178
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,106
this is the only thing you interact with as a user, right? This is the

179
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:37,686
only thing, basically you interact with as a developer,

180
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:41,574
a person trying to use mightymeld,

181
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,906
this is the only thing you interact with. This is where you get to drag

182
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:48,174
and drop edit all these things, but it actually sends some

183
00:11:48,212 --> 00:11:51,882
communication directly to describe for code generation,

184
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:55,310
for the code update and all that kind of stuff. I mean, some people actually

185
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,814
see my email as a code generation too, but it's not exactly a code generation

186
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:02,002
two. Don't misquote them. Sorry, don't misquote like the fact that

187
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:05,810
it's a code generation two at all. It's not even a code generation two

188
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,366
or anything similar. It can only be, right. But it

189
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:12,550
is not because it provides a different service,

190
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,166
it provides a different thing. If you want to use it as

191
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:19,878
a code generation too, you can, but that's

192
00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:23,306
not the aim, right? So this is

193
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:26,650
just everything literally about the studio. It helps to send

194
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,426
all the things to scribe, like the updates to scribe and then scribe

195
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:34,910
provides the updates right in the code base locally.

196
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,466
Right. So what it just does is the operations and it requests

197
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:42,814
to the LLM which tries to update the code.

198
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:46,434
So that's just really everything about the studio. This is just where you have

199
00:12:46,472 --> 00:12:49,970
everything done and right in the studio, you can see the browser, you can see

200
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,314
everything. You can see your

201
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:57,126
layout of your application and everything, right? That is just everything

202
00:12:57,228 --> 00:13:00,678
literally about the studio. Now, this is

203
00:13:00,684 --> 00:13:03,970
the mighty melt plugin. The mighty melt plugin is attached,

204
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,970
right to the envoy. And without this mightymeld melt plugin,

205
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:12,010
trust me, your application is also not running because

206
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,218
this is actually something attached right to the envoy. And without

207
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,302
this, you don't get to see so many things you see on this studio,

208
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:23,326
for example, like the browser and everything, because everything just

209
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:27,134
works with the browser API. But yeah, there is just a couple of

210
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:31,214
information about this Mytmail plugin. I mean, the Mightymeld melt plugin is

211
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:34,880
attached to different technologies. I mean, you can use this in next,

212
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,070
you can also use this in reacts.

213
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,746
You can use this in so many, you get

214
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:47,666
to see them at the end of the day. So it just lets

215
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:51,094
you do so many things and get all the features you're looking for in my

216
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:53,080
email and everything.

217
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,874
Basically, envoy provides this browser

218
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:01,766
API, right? So everything is all

219
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:06,118
on this mightymeld plugin. And it's

220
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:09,546
just actually insane how this plugin works. But without this,

221
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,580
your application is not even starting. So next,

222
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:18,430
Mightymeld melt plugin. So now you can see like the SWC,

223
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,606
SWC remix, react and everything. These are

224
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,702
just technologies you can actually use with react.

225
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,958
You can actually use in Mightymeld mail.

226
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:33,214
You can have your mighty mail plugin embedded into certain technologies.

227
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:36,722
You can actually have all these things really working with.

228
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:40,558
So you're adjustless technologies.

229
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:43,894
So next, Mightymeld mail just lets you do

230
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:47,606
a lot of stuff without writing a

231
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:50,786
single line of code, like just lets

232
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:55,002
you do this do that without even

233
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:58,682
writing a single line of code. And it's actually insane how it works.

234
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:02,134
It's insane. Very insane how it works.

235
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,966
But it's just the greatest advantage. And this is why

236
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,214
I think people really do miss core, like Mightymeld mail as

237
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:12,734
a code generation, too, which is not. But yes,

238
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:17,170
that is just really everything about Mightymeld mail and its entire architecture.

239
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,598
