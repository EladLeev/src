00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,526
Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining. My name is

2
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:24,838
Jessica Wirt. I am a UX strategist or user experience

3
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:28,886
strategist at UX consulting firm Truematter.

4
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:33,186
We are headquartered out of Columbia, South Carolina, which is also where I'm

5
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:36,774
from. And basically our job at Truematter and

6
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:40,774
my job as a UX strategist is to make sites and

7
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:44,890
apps and Internet, whatever digital products easy for

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,714
real people to use them. So that sounds pretty simple in

9
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:52,342
theory, but it is a little more complicated

10
00:00:52,406 --> 00:00:55,566
in practice. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in

11
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,550
a minute. But first, I'm really here to talk to you about

12
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,550
unicorns, as you might have guessed from the title of my presentation.

13
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,758
But I'm not here to talk to you about any old unicorn.

14
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:11,106
You'll have to probably go to a different sort of conference for that type

15
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:14,930
of thing. Im here to talk to you about UX unicorns.

16
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,920
There's a myth running around in our industry today.

17
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,320
A lot of companies hear about this fabled UX stuff,

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,838
and Im kind of poking fun at that idea.

19
00:01:26,924 --> 00:01:30,806
But truthfully, a lot of companies hear about the amazing metrics

20
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:34,026
and results that UX is producing for their users and

21
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:38,294
for their competitors. And so they think, awesome, let's hire

22
00:01:38,342 --> 00:01:42,026
a UX professional into our internal team structure,

23
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:45,422
and they're hoping to fix it for us. They're going

24
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,920
to do Ux for our company.

25
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,094
Now at Truematter, we jokingly call these new sites and

26
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:55,554
these individuals UX unicorns because

27
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:58,930
while they sound super fun and super magical,

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,010
they do not actually exist in practice.

29
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:07,222
UX unicorns do not exist because no

30
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:10,694
one person can handle all of the aspects and

31
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:15,074
experiences and disciplines involved in actually producing

32
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,220
excellent user experience all by themselves.

33
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,646
It inherently takes a team. So it's

34
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:25,590
great that companies understand that UX is valuable,

35
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,206
truly, and that they want to incorporate it into their teams,

36
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:33,322
but they get themselves in situations where they hire a UX

37
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,910
professional. They don't incorporate them in the correct

38
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,506
way because they don't really know how to. And so hiring

39
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:44,074
that UX professional doesn't actually end up producing the results

40
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,874
that they wanted to see and expected to see. So it

41
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:50,820
sort of youre the concept of UX for them.

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,110
That's because they're operating under a few myths.

43
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,002
Obviously, one of those myths is that UX unicorns do exist,

44
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:01,702
but at a more fundamental level, many companies just

45
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:05,046
don't understand what UX is. It's a

46
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,502
buzzword, even the acronym by itself.

47
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:12,074
I mean, who would know that UX stands for user experience on

48
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:14,620
its own. That's kind of confusing, right?

49
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,246
So because I know that some people watching things presentation

50
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:22,234
might find themselves in that camp, I want to talk about what

51
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:26,640
UX is, and I want to do that by talking about what UX is not.

52
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,658
First of all, UX is not a band aid. So it's

53
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:34,530
not something that if you have a poorly built,

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,746
poorly designed, or envisioned digital product,

55
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:41,298
you can simply slap on top and expect to see

56
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,946
the sort of amazing results that you're hearing about or might be

57
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:48,258
hearing about from other companies around you. So it's not a

58
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,782
band aid, not a quick fix. UX is also

59
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:55,638
not something that you can tag on at the end of a project.

60
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:59,418
It's not a last minute fix, just like it's not a quick fix.

61
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:03,146
UX is actually involved in every project where it

62
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:06,522
is truly thoroughly implemented and

63
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:09,930
thought of all the way from early discovery and definition

64
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,234
through implementation, existing and implementing any feedback

65
00:04:14,282 --> 00:04:18,126
from launch. So there is no such thing as a

66
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:21,742
UX phase or quick UX tag on to

67
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:24,580
make surface level changes. It goes far beyond that.

68
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,138
And of course, UX is not something that a single person

69
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:32,754
can do all by themselves. Now if it's not something

70
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:36,722
that one person can do alone, obviously that implies UX

71
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:40,134
always takes a team. And really, if we think about

72
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:44,054
it, it's not just that UX takes a team, it's thats

73
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:47,686
producing any truly excellent digital product is going to

74
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:51,114
take a team. So I want to talk about what

75
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:54,394
a fully fledged products teams actually looks

76
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:57,978
like. I want to talk about the five disciplines involved in

77
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:00,460
a fully fledged project team.

78
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,174
And a lot of companies are familiar, a lot of individuals are

79
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:09,646
familiar with at least some of these disciplines. But if some

80
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:12,866
of them sound a little bit nebulous or far off to you,

81
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:16,914
don't worry about that, because I'm about to explain to you what exactly each

82
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:20,514
of these individuals or people in each of these

83
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,180
disciplines actually does.

84
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,702
Im also, just to clarify, these are not every

85
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:30,994
single person that's involved in producing a digital

86
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:34,150
product. These are the hands on, day to day people

87
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,310
that are doing that sort of grunt work,

88
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,034
if I can call it that, as one of the people that does that sort

89
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:44,342
of thing. So I'm not talking about business analysts,

90
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:48,346
scrub masters, project managers, marketing, sales. All of

91
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:52,558
those people are obviously incredibly important to the ultimate success

92
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:56,142
of a product. But I'm talking about those

93
00:05:56,196 --> 00:06:00,638
hands on, day to day people because that is where UX expertise best

94
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:05,022
lives. So if you're familiar with some of these disciplines,

95
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:08,754
great, I'll go over them in a second. But another youre thing to

96
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:12,862
understand about UX and how to incorporate UX

97
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:16,598
expertise into a team is that, yes, you have these five

98
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:20,486
core disciplines of a product team. Within each of

99
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:24,294
these disciplines out there in the great wide world, there is a

100
00:06:24,332 --> 00:06:28,550
smaller group of people that are considered UX professionals.

101
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,550
That just means that as they go about their daily tasks

102
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,994
within this primary discipline, they're doing everything from

103
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:39,558
a user experience standpoint. So I'll

104
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:44,030
give myself as an example. My job title is UX strategist.

105
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,142
That's what I do. It's obviously a strategy position. So I'm thinking about high

106
00:06:48,196 --> 00:06:52,126
level product success and users at every turn. But I

107
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:55,966
come from a content strategy background, so I'm

108
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,506
also considered a content strategist. But because I'm a

109
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:02,926
UX professional, I'm sort of couched

110
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:06,562
under that discipline. And that's how most UX

111
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,294
professionals are. And that's truthfully where you'll find

112
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:14,342
the most value in hiring a UX professional is someone who comes

113
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:18,570
from a specific discipline but also really knows UX.

114
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,222
So let's talk through each of these one by one, starting with developers.

115
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:27,050
You probably know about these people extremely important.

116
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,610
They build for product users and use cases if they're

117
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,474
developers, that are also UX professionals. So UX

118
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:38,554
developers or UX people in each discipline think a little bit differently

119
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:42,422
than their counterparts that are not UX professionals. So UX

120
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:45,822
developers also guard against extra features and functions

121
00:07:45,886 --> 00:07:49,586
that users don't actually need, and they really

122
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:52,690
build towards usable patterns for experience,

123
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,910
consistency. All of that helps that end user.

124
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,286
In the same way, visual designers that are UX professionals think

125
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:05,170
about layouts and styles for how humans actually operate

126
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,254
and take in information online. They are always considering

127
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:12,380
interactive behavior as it relates to design,

128
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:16,186
so they work closely with other members of the product team in

129
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,610
order to do so. And they're thinking task based

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,902
design at every turn because that communicates how to actually use

131
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:27,760
the interface, not just tone or style, but how it is used.

132
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:33,406
Content strategist you may or may not be familiar with. These are

133
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:37,506
the people that come from writing backgrounds. Some of them come

134
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:40,014
from, honestly, all sorts of backgrounds.

135
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:43,186
Psychology, marketing could be a lot

136
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,790
of different things, but these are the people that are thinking about

137
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,802
presentation of information and actions for how humans

138
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:55,206
actually digest words online. They're thinking about the right words

139
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:58,922
to guide users to the right task. So they work super

140
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:02,566
closely with visual designers in that regard, and they're

141
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:06,250
thinking towards reusable content patterns that support design

142
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,614
and development. User researchers

143
00:09:10,742 --> 00:09:14,334
this is more of a traditional UX role. As you might think about it,

144
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:19,262
they're different than market researchers or other type of resources because

145
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:22,960
they are truly honed in on the user at every turn.

146
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,122
They are observing real people using products in real life.

147
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:30,702
They're designing and conducting activities leading to valuable

148
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:34,738
interactive input. So in layman's terms,

149
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,514
they're actually talking to individual end users and conducting

150
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:41,880
activities with them to gain that valuable information.

151
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,374
They're using task based tests with users to see what

152
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:49,930
is and is not working. These are the people

153
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,242
that really uncover all sorts of fun,

154
00:09:53,296 --> 00:09:56,230
unexpected things when it comes to UX,

155
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,782
because across the board, people do not use digital

156
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:04,250
products like you might expect them to. Of course, there are best practices

157
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,286
within the UX community and within the digital product community.

158
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:12,634
Yes, but people surprise us all the time. That's why

159
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:15,860
user researchers are so pivotal to a product team.

160
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,910
And last but not least, you have information architects.

161
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,146
These people areas also more of a traditional UX

162
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,094
role. They are thinking about organizational structures that

163
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:32,962
make sense to real people. They are functional,

164
00:10:33,106 --> 00:10:36,354
or rather, they are thinking of functional but human understandable

165
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:40,342
interfaces. And they're really bridging the gap between technical

166
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,682
requirements and user interactions. So because

167
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:49,574
they do that, they really do bridge the gap between how to structure

168
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:52,990
and build a product for

169
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,574
those end users in a way that's going to be intuitive to them and

170
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:58,240
make sense at every turn.

171
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,078
So that gets us to our final fully fledged

172
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:07,326
product team in each of those disciplines.

173
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:11,058
Obviously, it's important to have people that

174
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:13,970
are specialists in each of those disciplines. Yes,

175
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,190
but in a truly ideal state, each of those

176
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,838
disciplines would also represent someone

177
00:11:20,924 --> 00:11:23,910
who is a true expert in UX,

178
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,214
or at least has a functional, working understanding

179
00:11:28,262 --> 00:11:32,220
of how to incorporate UX best practices into their team.

180
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,162
Now, what you'll notice is that obviously an entire group

181
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:40,666
of professionals, whether or not they are UX professionals,

182
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:43,598
far outweighs what any one single,

183
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:46,480
even magical being can do all by themselves.

184
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,374
So why do so many companies still think that

185
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:53,230
UX unicorns exist?

186
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,426
My take, it's either because they don't understand

187
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:02,434
what UX is, which we've talked about already,

188
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:06,510
or they simply don't understand what successful

189
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,486
user experience looks like in practice. So I want to give you an

190
00:12:10,508 --> 00:12:14,422
example of what that looks like. I'm going to show you the before and

191
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:18,078
after of a website for healthcare

192
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:21,180
organization that we've actually worked with in the past. At true matter,

193
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,538
the before will probably seem familiar to some of you.

194
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:28,300
I'll go ahead and show you that.

195
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,826
Yeah, it's a big sites here, lots of links,

196
00:12:35,018 --> 00:12:39,742
an attempt at organization, but obviously this

197
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:42,894
digital product could not support it. It was not in

198
00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:46,274
any sort of organized cms so

199
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:49,966
it needed a lot of work. This clearly needed a massive UX overhaul,

200
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,126
so that's what we gave it. So I'm showing you the after version

201
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:57,638
on mobile because obviously that's what we're focused on here.

202
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:01,526
But you can see all the way from high

203
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,930
level organization in this navigational structure

204
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,246
down to the simplicity of the design on the screens,

205
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,010
the content strategy,

206
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,674
just high level statements, high level micro copy or

207
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,850
extremely valuable microcopy.

208
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,806
Functionally everything is vastly improved from

209
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:25,530
that before. This is what user experience produces.

210
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,406
These are the kinds of results thats you can see in your

211
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:34,834
digital product with UX know how incorporated and

212
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:38,130
it produces metrics too. We've had companies

213
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,070
see 45% increase in site traffic,

214
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,562
65% reduction in maintenance over time,

215
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:48,760
which is just massive. Everybody understands how critical that is.

216
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,366
And this one's fun. 465% increase in

217
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:57,206
mobile use from a before and after for a

218
00:13:57,228 --> 00:14:00,620
site super similar to the example that you just saw.

219
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,066
That is what a fully fledged product team

220
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:08,522
with user experience know how applied at every

221
00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:11,310
turn in every phase produces.

222
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,686
But what about money? Of course, what about money and what

223
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,886
but stakeholder approval? If you don't

224
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:23,200
have the budget and approval to actually

225
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,940
incorporate UX know how into your team in every single individual,

226
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:33,022
that's okay. There are still things that you can do and that involves having

227
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:36,654
a single UX professional. Now if you're thinking,

228
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,450
isn't the entire purpose of this presentation to convince me that I shouldn't

229
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,880
hire a single UX professional, you're sort of right.

230
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,526
You don't needed to hire a UX unicorn. You needed

231
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:51,594
to hire a UX professional and use their know how and their

232
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:55,962
skill sites to bolster the strengths that your team

233
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,500
already is producing with the disciplines that it already has.

234
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,098
So it's not that you can't hire a single UX professional and be successful,

235
00:15:04,214 --> 00:15:07,790
you definitely should if you have the budget and approval to do so.

236
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,454
It's that you have to go about incorporating that UX know how

237
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:14,930
in the right way. So let's walk through those steps.

238
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,154
It starts with identifying your gaps. Before you ever write

239
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,678
a job description or look outwardly,

240
00:15:21,774 --> 00:15:25,698
to hire a UX professional, you need to understand

241
00:15:25,864 --> 00:15:30,390
your current product team's strengths and weaknesses thoroughly.

242
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,246
So let's look at an example. Let's say this is your product team. You have

243
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:37,720
Romeo and Juliet. We won't ask any questions there.

244
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,978
Let's say Romeo is a front end developer and Juliet is a

245
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,770
back end developer. This is what a lot of product teams actually

246
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,250
look like, obviously, especially development teams.

247
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,310
So out of these five key disciplines, you only have one

248
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,686
area covered. That's not good, but you can work

249
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,634
with that. That means when you hire a UX professional,

250
00:16:02,682 --> 00:16:06,462
when you actually do go to write that job description, you should target

251
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:10,226
hiring a UX professional that has a background in one of the

252
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:14,100
disciplines that you are missing from your team right now.

253
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,398
Now when you complete this steps and you're sort of thinking through,

254
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:22,440
okay, what do we have? Who do we have?

255
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,710
Make sure youll analyze untapped potential on your team.

256
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,346
If you have especially a lot of individuals on your

257
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:33,210
product team thats are in a single discipline,

258
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:38,198
look for any underlying skill sets or skill

259
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,966
sets thats you can bolster really people that

260
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:46,362
you can direct to sort of COVID one of the other disciplines

261
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:50,430
if you have that available to you. So let's say someone

262
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,154
on your team is a developer and this is kind of an odd scenario,

263
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:57,934
but maybe they areas also a visual designer or they have worked as a visual

264
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:02,338
designer in the past, they have a skill set there or

265
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:05,346
there's something you can do to be able to give them a little bit of

266
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:08,774
education, train them a little bit so that they can cover

267
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:12,658
that discipline. Do it. Because when you go to hire

268
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:16,102
a UX professional, that means you just have one more discipline already

269
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:19,578
covered. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to

270
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:23,494
look for someone to cover it. So once you analyze

271
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,570
your gaps,

272
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,260
you needed to prioritize those gaps based on upcoming products needs.

273
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,054
So obviously, if you only have developers on your

274
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:38,378
team and you have all gaps in all of those other disciplines,

275
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,840
youre going to need to do some prioritization based on

276
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,858
what you have coming up. You basically need to ask the question,

277
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,810
okay, based on the projects that I have coming up,

278
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,234
who do I really need? What discipline am I

279
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,100
hoping to have to have to do this? Well,

280
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,614
for example, let's say you know your team is about to build a ton

281
00:18:00,652 --> 00:18:03,602
of forms. If you're full of developers,

282
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,598
if you have all that developer knowledge, that's going to be a walk in the

283
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:09,820
park to actually create those and build them out.

284
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,522
But look at all of the copy that you have here. You need people

285
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:18,106
that understand structure and how to write a form so that you get

286
00:18:18,128 --> 00:18:21,626
effective responses. So maybe the UX professional

287
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:24,926
that you go to hire is a content strategist or an

288
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:26,990
information architect by trade.

289
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,930
Maybe for another example maybe

290
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,500
you are doing some sort of patient facing application

291
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,610
for a healthcare system like we talked about earlier.

292
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,170
So there's a lot of design involved here and

293
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,126
it's probably going to be pretty important to understand the types of patients thats

294
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,406
are coming in and going to be using this and filling that out.

295
00:18:52,588 --> 00:18:56,134
So maybe the UX professional that you hire is either

296
00:18:56,172 --> 00:19:00,038
a visual designer or a user researcher. So that's

297
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:03,114
sort of how you practically go about targeting. Okay,

298
00:19:03,232 --> 00:19:07,142
which of the gaps should I really focus on? Which discipline

299
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:10,906
do I truly need to hire someone in? And if you can make

300
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:13,920
thats person a UX professional, it's a win win situation.

301
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,974
So the next step is supporting your new hire. And I

302
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:24,254
say that knowing that there's a steps that I'm skipping pretty much

303
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:27,534
entirely. You actually have to find the right person and hire

304
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:30,978
them. That's actually the easiest step of this entire process.

305
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:34,466
So I'm not going to cover it very much, but if you

306
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:38,166
have specific questions there, I'm happy to answer them. You can find me on

307
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:42,374
LinkedIn and just reach, but I can pass along some articles or some know

308
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:45,846
how to help with that. Supporting your new

309
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:49,290
hire is probably the most critical phase of this entire

310
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,870
process. This is where a lot of companies misstep

311
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,214
and start treating their new hire like a UX

312
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:59,974
unicorns. You treat your new hire like a UX unicorn,

313
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:04,126
they will start to act like one. Which means they

314
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:07,454
will run away into the magical forest of LinkedIn and you will never

315
00:20:07,492 --> 00:20:10,958
hear from them again. They'll quit. You don't want that.

316
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,710
You obviously can't afford thats for your project budget,

317
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,770
timeline and sanity. All of the above.

318
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,634
So don't treat them like a UX unicorn. That starts with where

319
00:20:21,672 --> 00:20:25,622
you place them in your organizational structure. If you

320
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:29,574
leave your new Ux hire out in an island by themselves

321
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:32,610
outside of youre existing team structure,

322
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,322
everyone is going to look at them like some weird

323
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:40,566
UX person, which is how most people already view UX professionals.

324
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:44,102
And that's fine, but that's not going to help you get anywhere,

325
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:47,574
practically speaking, when it's time to start incorporating UX

326
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:51,150
knowledge into your actual product decisions.

327
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,454
So instead of doing thats, always, always put

328
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:58,878
your UX professional inside of an existing team

329
00:20:58,964 --> 00:21:02,286
structure. Like I said towards the beginning, that's where they

330
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:06,770
belong. They belong doing that day to day discipline specific

331
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,462
work. They're just hoping to do it with that UX

332
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:14,020
focus and with users in mind at every turn.

333
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,306
Now, beyond actually placing them in your structure,

334
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:22,006
immediately involve them in that day to day product

335
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:25,414
work that can involve even reviewing what

336
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,786
other people have done for UX best practices,

337
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:32,762
sharing some of that know how and that's really the last

338
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:36,566
step to making a new UX hire successful.

339
00:21:36,678 --> 00:21:40,426
When you only have the budget or the go ahead for one person, you have

340
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:44,778
to use what they know and use their skills to share UX knowledge

341
00:21:44,874 --> 00:21:46,800
with the rest of your team.

342
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:52,378
But you have to be realistic at this phase. Just like one person

343
00:21:52,484 --> 00:21:56,494
cannot handle all of Ux by themselves, one UX

344
00:21:56,542 --> 00:22:00,050
professional cannot turn your existing product team into

345
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,182
a group of fully fledged UX professionals.

346
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:05,780
Maybe if you have ten years, sure.

347
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,438
But one person is not going to be able to do everything

348
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:14,354
required for their job and train everybody in all of the UX

349
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:18,182
best practices. Provide them the experience. That stuff takes

350
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:22,506
time, so they're not going to be able to do that. But what

351
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:26,714
you can do and what you're aiming for is a UX happy team.

352
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:30,654
Your single UX hire can share enough of the best

353
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:33,850
practices knowledge for UX, the practical

354
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:37,054
decision making, they can weigh in, they can review other

355
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:40,810
people's work. Creating a UX

356
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,306
happy team, all thats means is you have

357
00:22:44,328 --> 00:22:48,434
a product team where one person is a UX professional but

358
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:51,742
everybody else is doing their best to incorporate UX

359
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:55,206
best practices and think about users and that will

360
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:59,154
make a world of difference. That is what progress

361
00:22:59,282 --> 00:23:03,046
looks like. It's not your ideal state, but it's good

362
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:08,294
enough to start getting you some of those amazing results only

363
00:23:08,332 --> 00:23:11,370
if you do not treat them like a UX unicorns.

364
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,274
So in order to do that, you have to make sure you follow the right

365
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:19,078
steps when you're hiring a UX professional. Identify your gaps,

366
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:22,718
prioritize project needs so look at

367
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:26,362
your gaps and prioritize the person in the right discipline

368
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:30,014
that you actually need to hire. Then support them by

369
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:33,582
putting them in an existing team structure and

370
00:23:33,636 --> 00:23:37,554
from there share the UX know how from that individual to

371
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:38,900
the rest of your team.

372
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,546
That just might be enough to get youll the budget and the

373
00:23:44,568 --> 00:23:48,406
go ahead to hire another UX professional. At which point you

374
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:52,146
would of course just go back through the process again. Continue sharing

375
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:56,198
that UX knowledge. Continue relying on your entire team,

376
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:59,580
not just one individual to come in and save the day.

377
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,866
But even if you don't get the budget in the

378
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,986
hire for another UX professional, at the end

379
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:10,254
of the day, progress still looks like

380
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:13,934
a team of individuals all collaboratively working towards

381
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:17,850
one UX goal. And that starts with one UX hire

382
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,214
that is not treated like a UX unicorns and

383
00:24:23,252 --> 00:24:26,734
that's about all I have for you today. So if you're interested in user

384
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:30,578
experience, you want to learn more both about team structure and from a

385
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:33,582
more basic perspective of what the heck is ux?

386
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:36,370
Because I get it. What the heck is ux?

387
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,502
We have additional reading@truematter.com

388
00:24:40,556 --> 00:24:44,306
slash ideas. That's our blog. We just put but educational

389
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:48,310
materials so that people can learn about ux.

390
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:52,706
That's where you'll find the post thats sparked

391
00:24:52,738 --> 00:24:55,770
this whole presentation. Ux unicorns do not exist.

392
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:59,786
If youre from a little bit more of a technical background or someone that

393
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:03,774
you work with might benefit from understanding how developers and

394
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:07,774
UX professionals work together, we have an article specifically for that.

395
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:11,566
And we have additional articles on mobile use.

396
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:15,610
So what's the coordination between UX and mobile?

397
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,246
All sorts of stuff. Design any discipline or

398
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:23,262
area that you're interested in. We have more there other

399
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:24,380
than that. Thank you.
