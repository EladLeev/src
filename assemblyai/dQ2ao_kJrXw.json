Today we will discuss about quant quantum sensors, how it will revolutionizing the traditional GPS technology. And I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in computer science at Asan Institute of Science and Technology. You can connect me in LinkedIn. I am just one message away. What is quantum sensors? Quantum sensors are an advanced sensor technology that detects the change in motion, force, electric and magnetic field by collecting data at atomic level. So why we need quantum sensors? The quantum sensors are more precise and accurate than the traditional sensors and there are many disadvantages of traditional sensors utilize the properties of quantum mechanics such as quantum entanglement, quantum interference and many more. Type of quantum sensors there are many type of quantum sensors, but mainly it is used to precisely measure the acceleration force, magnetic and gravitational fields. Quantum accelerometer the quantum accelerometer uses ultracooled atom to make a highly accurate measurement. When it cooled to extremely low temperature, the atom starts to display quantum nature, resulting in wavelike properties. As the atom moves the sensors, an optical rule. We can measure the acceleration by using the optical rule. It will be more accurate than the traditional sensors. The quantum compass most navigation today relies on global navigation satellite system, also known as GNSS such as GPS which sends and receive the signal from satellite orbiting the earth. But the quantum accelerometer is self contained system that does not rely on any external signals. It is independent navigation using quantum accelerometer. The navigation using a quantum accelerometer we need precise starting position and by using the quantum accelerometer we can measure the acceleration very precisely. So we can use this port data to determine our position in 3d space. Traditional navigation system versus navigation using quantum sensors to navigate using global positioning system which is also known as GPS, we need external source like satellites and for precise measurement we need four to five satellites. Because of all this, it is quite expensive and it depends on external source. That's why it's easy to jam and hack. This will not rely on any external source. Because of that, it will give more accurate navigation and it's quite difficult to hack it. What is the progress? The UK's first quantum accelerometer for navigation has been demonstrated by the team of Imperial College London. A prototype of quantum sensors built at Imperial will be applicable in GPS free navigation has been tested in collaboration with Royal Navy. So we are getting progress in the GPS free navigation system. But the quantum sensors are quite big. So this is the disadvantage of quantum sensors. But the advantage is it is more accurate than our GPS systems.
