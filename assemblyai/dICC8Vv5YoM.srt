1
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,862
Hello and welcome to the future of work.

2
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:44,210
I bet you didn't realize that we were going to get here literally overnight.

3
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,114
But here we are in a completely new landscape.

4
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:51,694
And as we prepare to emerge, merge into a new set

5
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:55,902
of normal, many are taking this time to evaluate what

6
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:59,898
habits and routines bird that of COVID necessity

7
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:03,902
should be added to our new normal, what should be omitted

8
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:07,010
and what could be changed. And one thing

9
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,482
that has taken the world by storm is the

10
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,938
emergence of remote teams and remote work.

11
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:17,778
And while there have been some organizations,

12
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:23,586
this has been the norm for many, many organizations.

13
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:27,238
Remote teams were unheard of a few months ago.

14
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:30,566
And as we reemerge into a collective

15
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:34,090
society once again, many organizations are

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,478
re evaluating the benefit and challenges

17
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:41,440
of remote teams. Which leads me to this.

18
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,490
How do we build and lead remote teams?

19
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,798
Well, my name is Amber Vanderburg, and I'm the founder of the Pathways group,

20
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:54,210
where we work with teams from all over the world,

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,966
training in effective leadership, team building and strategic

22
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:01,554
human resources. Now, I've traveled physically with my

23
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:04,974
mask and virtually around the

24
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:08,690
globe, speaking and consulting with organizations

25
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,974
that are transforming the way that we do

26
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:15,798
work. First, let's acknowledge that not

27
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:20,022
all remote teams are equal. There are remote teams

28
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:23,466
that are globally remote, meaning that there are

29
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:27,114
teams that consists of remote workers from all over the

30
00:02:27,152 --> 00:02:29,770
world. These teams,

31
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,746
they can be more diverse. They have a greater breadth

32
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:37,982
of network experience and knowledge, but it also

33
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:41,774
has additional challenges in cultural communication and

34
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:45,570
collaboration, and of course, time zones.

35
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,126
And today I lead teams that are globally remote.

36
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,726
But in the same regard, there are domestically remote

37
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:57,266
teams in addition to locally remote

38
00:02:57,298 --> 00:03:00,854
teams. And these are teams that do work

39
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:04,374
from home, but they are in the same general

40
00:03:04,492 --> 00:03:07,942
geographic space. And then there are

41
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:11,874
hybrid remote teams in which employees

42
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,954
and team members work sometime at home,

43
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,954
and then they also spend time at the office.

44
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:22,510
So it's important to keep in mind what type

45
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,234
of remote team player and what type of remote

46
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:29,998
team that you are leading as you're seeking to build

47
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:34,222
and lead your team. And so identifying

48
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:37,506
what type of remote team that you have can really act as a

49
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:41,198
guide for creating your policy, your leadership style

50
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,810
and your organizational culture.

51
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,290
Now, I've lived and I've worked all over the world in international

52
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,926
business, and I believe that leading great

53
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:55,670
teams boils down to four pillars of

54
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,126
team management or human resource management.

55
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,222
Now, this is not using humans as resources.

56
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:07,194
It's provide resources to humans so

57
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:11,146
that they can be as successful as they can be. And it's providing

58
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:14,542
resources so that your team and the people within

59
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:17,402
your team can reach their goals.

60
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:20,974
And if you are successful in all four of

61
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:24,754
these pillars, then you're doing all right. And while

62
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:28,354
the application and the tools towards success are

63
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:31,902
slightly different in physically

64
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:35,554
close teams rather than remote teams, these pillars

65
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:39,186
and these main ideas really do remain

66
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:43,350
the same. And the first pillar is to build

67
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,550
your team. That's right.

68
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,554
It's really that simple. Build your

69
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:53,654
team. See, if you're a hiring manager,

70
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:57,114
you are a decision maker in the future of

71
00:04:57,152 --> 00:05:00,746
your company because recruitment is literally

72
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:05,262
how organizations build the future. So what

73
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:09,600
factors should you consider whenever building your team?

74
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,234
What specifically should you be looking for?

75
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:16,420
Is it personality? Experience? Education?

76
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,526
I was working with one hybrid remote team as the HR

77
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:23,854
director, and we had a serious discussion

78
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:28,118
about what our ideal team player looked like.

79
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:31,554
And one of my favorite leadership gurus

80
00:05:31,602 --> 00:05:35,522
and authors, Patrick Lynn Sioni, writes that the ideal

81
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:39,302
team player has three major factors that

82
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:42,878
you can look for in your remote teams.

83
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:47,686
The first is to look for a team member that is humble.

84
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:51,742
Now, a humble team member is trainable and open

85
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:55,898
to healthy conversation. They don't have huge egos

86
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:59,994
and they truly are a team player. A humble

87
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:03,186
person is adaptable, which is really important

88
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:07,042
in remote teams. They listen to others and they

89
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:10,450
admit mistakes as learning opportunities.

90
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,414
And in a remote team, the likelihood of mistakes

91
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:17,970
due to miscommunication and cultural misunderstandings

92
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,182
is massive. And so a humble team member must

93
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:26,562
be able to acknowledge misunderstandings and be proactive

94
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:29,350
in learning about other culturals,

95
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,860
communication styles and ways of work.

96
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,740
They must be adaptable. It's so important

97
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,142
that your team member can adapt and change to

98
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:46,282
new situations. And whenever you're recruiting for a humble

99
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:49,982
team member, ask specifically about their

100
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:53,234
experience when working with different cultures and

101
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:56,798
communication styles. Ask about adapting

102
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:59,630
to new landscapes and dynamics,

103
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,474
and ask them about any misunderstandings or

104
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:07,302
miscommunications and how they have or would

105
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:09,720
have handled that situation.

106
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,874
Remember, it's really important to recruit

107
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:17,398
a team member that is humble. The next

108
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:20,922
major factor of an ideal team member is someone who is

109
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:24,746
hungry. Now, a hungry team member is always

110
00:07:24,848 --> 00:07:28,314
longing to improve and be better. They love

111
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,694
to take on new opportunities, they have really good

112
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,720
work ethic and they have a drive to grow.

113
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,106
Hungry people have an energy and a passion that is unmatched

114
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:43,994
by some companies that have warm bodies

115
00:07:44,042 --> 00:07:47,842
of building the seats, right? So we want to have people that

116
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:51,774
are hungry. And whenever you are recruiting a hungry

117
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:55,086
team member, ask about something for which they

118
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:58,694
have worked hard. Ask them how they spend

119
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:02,406
their free time. Ask about their work ethic as a

120
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:06,054
youngster, and these questions will help you to

121
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:09,766
get an idea of the type of hunger

122
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:13,882
that your applicant or potential team member may

123
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:18,042
bring to your organization. Remember, much of

124
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,870
remote work is self driven, and in

125
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,610
any team, trusting your team members to be good stewards

126
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,774
of time and energy and resources is really important,

127
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:34,098
but it is an absolute dire necessity in

128
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:37,790
remote teams. You want to have confidence

129
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,222
that your remote workers are hungry and self driven

130
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:45,750
and self motivated. Emerging technology

131
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,742
plays a critical role in remote work,

132
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:52,582
and equipping your team members with continuing education

133
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:56,754
and tools to thrive in remote workplaces

134
00:08:56,882 --> 00:09:00,794
is really critical. So ask your candidate or

135
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:04,694
potential team member about their experience with continuing

136
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:08,230
education and their openness to new technologies.

137
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,618
In particular, assess current technological literacy

138
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:16,570
and also forecast future technological learnings.

139
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,286
The world is quickly changing and it

140
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:23,922
is vital that your remote team members

141
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,522
be eager to learn and to change to stay

142
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:30,370
relevant in our evolving workforce.

143
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,370
You want to seek a team member that is hungry.

144
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,486
The final factor that Patrick Lincione tells us to look for in our

145
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:42,390
team members, especially in remote teams, is to find

146
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,310
a team member that is smart. Now,

147
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,294
a smart team member is both technically smart and

148
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:54,278
also is people smart. So they have a high EQ

149
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:58,150
and a high iq. A smart person is capable

150
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,982
of doing the job. And when recruiting for a

151
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:06,106
smart team member, ask about their personality,

152
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:09,498
ask about handling difficult colleagues,

153
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:13,730
ask about their ability and skills to do the specific

154
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,618
job, and these questions will help you get an idea of the

155
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:21,586
spartness that your candidate will possess for

156
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:24,050
the job as a player in your organization.

157
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,110
Empathy is key in a remote employee

158
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,938
and it really requires a specific ability and intentionality

159
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,966
to do well. And oftentimes empathy is overlooked

160
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:41,270
as a critical skill, especially in remote

161
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,638
teams. A major pain point in many remote teams

162
00:10:45,734 --> 00:10:49,146
is a lack of personal connection, and a

163
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:53,114
smart teams member builds connections with others and seeks

164
00:10:53,162 --> 00:10:56,542
relationships. A smart team member is well

165
00:10:56,596 --> 00:11:00,490
equipped to do the job in ability and skill in IQ,

166
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,898
but also has a tremendous high level of

167
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:08,260
EQ and people skills as well.

168
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,850
Also, remote players,

169
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,714
they have to be adaptable to different cultures and schedules

170
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,566
and of course, if you're in a globally remote team,

171
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:22,374
time zones. So ask about flexibility to

172
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:26,870
schedule and if they can be smart in those different relationships.

173
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,434
Remember, there are different skill sets that you

174
00:11:31,472 --> 00:11:35,642
use in a remote team, such as having

175
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,334
to be very good at email and video conferencing

176
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:43,486
and technology, whereas in

177
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:47,006
a physical brick and mortar team, it might be a little

178
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,270
bit different skills that you're looking for as well.

179
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,082
So there is a difference and so be very specific in

180
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:58,030
knowing what the job is so that you can be very catered

181
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,922
in the questions that you are asking to assess the smartness of

182
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:05,778
your potential candidate. So seek a team player

183
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:09,126
that has a high EQ and a

184
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:12,550
high IQ EQ being emotional intelligence.

185
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,882
So an ideal team member

186
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,834
doesn't possess just one or two,

187
00:12:19,952 --> 00:12:23,734
but actually possesses all three of these factors.

188
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:28,150
And if any one of these factors are missing, then the idealness

189
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,574
of the candidate begins to wane a little. See,

190
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:35,198
a hungry and a smart player that isn't humble will

191
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:38,654
be very arrogant to the team and not want

192
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:42,398
to train to improve. And a humble and a smart person

193
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:45,842
will do the job, but not have the drive to do

194
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:49,230
anymore. And a hungry and a humble player

195
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,042
that isn't smart will work really hard, but not

196
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:56,998
be of maximum use and productivity to the team.

197
00:12:57,164 --> 00:13:00,486
So depending on the job, the fact that somebody

198
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:04,594
has a great personality and is personable and dresses

199
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:08,310
for success might not have any influence

200
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,186
on getting the job done. The fact that he is

201
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:15,882
a poor communicator through email might actually play

202
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:19,894
a very significant role. And so the questions and the factors

203
00:13:19,942 --> 00:13:23,758
that we seek in our remote workers are not exactly the same

204
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,306
as our brick and mortar employees. So here's

205
00:13:27,338 --> 00:13:30,750
what I want you to do. I want you to look at

206
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,866
your interview questions, review the questions that you are asking in

207
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:38,482
that interview process, and intentionally recruit your

208
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:41,890
ideal team member whenever building your

209
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,440
team. And that's your first pillar, is to build your team.

210
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,214
The next pillar is to value your team.

211
00:13:50,332 --> 00:13:53,542
So we're going to value our team.

212
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:57,058
And whether it's in person or remotely,

213
00:13:57,154 --> 00:14:00,682
it's actually really critical that we express value to

214
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,802
our team members, because people want

215
00:14:03,856 --> 00:14:07,306
to feel valued. And one simple way that

216
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:10,830
we can show our value is to provide the right

217
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,614
tools and systems for our team.

218
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,214
Communication, project management, and HR tools are

219
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:21,054
all really important for equipping our teams to be

220
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:25,234
successful. And if you say that you care about team success and

221
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:28,974
then deny the right tools and investment and resources,

222
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,798
it can be really, really frustrations for your employees.

223
00:14:32,974 --> 00:14:37,270
So take a moment to look at your toolbox.

224
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,794
The tools for remote workers are slightly altered

225
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:45,478
from brick and mortar. Also, logistics are a

226
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,918
little bit different. Time zones,

227
00:14:48,034 --> 00:14:52,042
mediums of communication, time off communication are

228
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:56,506
all a little bit different, especially in terms of

229
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,858
being mindful of emails and phones.

230
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:03,934
Personally, it is my belief that it is worthwhile to

231
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:07,210
try and separate personal and professional

232
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,814
phones and emails and mediums of communication in

233
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:14,318
that onboarding process for a couple of different reasons.

234
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:18,174
First, it's a very clear distinction between professional

235
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:22,178
life and personal life, which is a good mind difference

236
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:25,522
for your employees. But second, it makes

237
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:29,254
for a very clear offboarding process if and

238
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:33,206
when your employees and your team members are

239
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:36,294
no longer a part of the organization. And so it makes for

240
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:40,460
a very clean onboarding process on the back end.

241
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,206
Another way that we can show value is through communication

242
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,826
and through benefits. And for a remote team,

243
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:52,350
it is a little bit different from brick and mortar. I mean,

244
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,870
does anyone actually care about teams Friday?

245
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,074
Not really, especially not in a remote

246
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:03,842
team. See, compensation takes into

247
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,378
account industry and organization and position,

248
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:10,690
no matter the status of work. Now,

249
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,606
some have begun a conversation about the physical

250
00:16:14,718 --> 00:16:18,406
cost of living and people that live in

251
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:22,022
different places and those different costs of living and how that has an effect

252
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:25,254
on remote workers. This is a conversation that is

253
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:29,142
still ongoing. There is a variety of different opinions

254
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:32,938
that various organizations are looking into.

255
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:37,366
So that might be a factor that you want to include within your conversation

256
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:41,598
whenever you are deciding your communication. And your benefits is

257
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:45,790
the physical cost of living of your remote workers.

258
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,926
And then you also can look at your benefits.

259
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:52,938
Now, benefits is a really fun part about leading teams

260
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:56,114
and here's what I want you to do. Very simple,

261
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,634
ask your team members what benefits your

262
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:03,266
employees want. So take the time to listen to

263
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,560
your employees and ask those questions.

264
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,358
Also, there are ways that you can engage your

265
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:13,798
team members and valuing your team

266
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:17,640
by actually valuing your team.

267
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,166
Lack of social interaction has proven to be very tough

268
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:26,042
on some remote team members. So send

269
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:30,006
care packages, check in. Be intentional about

270
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:34,014
building a relationship. Find ways to

271
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,898
connect with your team members through your Zoom meetings.

272
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:41,418
Beyond just professional gap, some teams

273
00:17:41,434 --> 00:17:44,926
are doing this through themed dress up days for their Zoom

274
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,674
meetings. They're having happy hours with

275
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:52,418
their team members. They're having game nights. I've hosted a

276
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:55,974
number of different game shows to really engage our

277
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:58,582
team members and to move beyond that personal,

278
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:02,870
professional gab and still have that personal connection.

279
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,302
Any way that you do it, be personal to your teams, but find

280
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:11,354
a way to show that value by building a

281
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:15,018
personal connection and a personal relationship

282
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:18,874
with your team members. So we

283
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:22,074
have built our team. We valued

284
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:26,126
our team. Now it's time to train

285
00:18:26,228 --> 00:18:29,870
our team. So I always think about Rocky

286
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,934
in the first rocky whenever he is training for a

287
00:18:33,972 --> 00:18:37,566
championship and he goes up on top of the stairs

288
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:41,202
and he raises his hands as he is training. And so I always

289
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:43,970
think of training as raising my hands.

290
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,986
See, I oftentimes think about a famous

291
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:51,810
professional sporting teams. I think of a professional

292
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,798
NFL teams. And imagine if you built

293
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,306
a solid team. You recruited the best players in

294
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:03,274
the industry, you paid them the highest salary and

295
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:06,170
then you never went to practice,

296
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,038
you never trained. The likelihood of you actually

297
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:15,280
winning a championship is very, very small.

298
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,582
Recruiting the best players and paying them the most salary will

299
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:23,650
not guarantee success. You have to train in between

300
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,378
Sundays so that you can compete on game day.

301
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:31,762
See, the world of work is ever evolving and

302
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:35,418
we must be able to train our employees

303
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:39,174
to stay relevant and to stay competitive and

304
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,738
to truly stay engaged. Virtual meetups

305
00:19:42,754 --> 00:19:46,070
and continuing education can be really powerful.

306
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,410
Also, don't discredit the power of in person

307
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,530
meetings, say annually or biannually.

308
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,398
Some, if they are domestically remote or locally remote,

309
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:00,910
will do monthly meetings depending on how

310
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,574
vast your geographic separation is within your

311
00:20:04,612 --> 00:20:08,046
remote teams, find ways to offer

312
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:12,250
confronting education and continuous training within

313
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,414
your team. This is where we truly

314
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:20,162
offer the opportunities for our hungry team

315
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:24,110
members, for our driven team members to continuously

316
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,606
improve and progress. So continue to stay up

317
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:31,938
with your team and to stay up with the learning opportunities

318
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:35,382
and the growth opportunities within your team

319
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:39,546
and continue the best practices to empower your team members

320
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:43,290
to move forward, both professionally and personally.

321
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,722
So first we're going to build our teams.

322
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:51,230
We're going to recruit humble, hungry and

323
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,350
smart team members to our remote teams.

324
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,640
Next, we're going to show value to our team,

325
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,862
which is shown a little bit differently in remote teams

326
00:21:02,926 --> 00:21:07,042
than brick and mortar teams. Next, we're going to

327
00:21:07,176 --> 00:21:11,170
train our team. And training your team is

328
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,206
critical again, both in physical teams,

329
00:21:14,318 --> 00:21:18,118
physically close teams or remote teams. And we're going to

330
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:22,258
do that by offering different technologies and offering

331
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:26,342
continuing education opportunities and offering different ways

332
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:29,786
that we can flex our muscles to continue to

333
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:33,706
grow and to continue to improve so that we can stay competitive and

334
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:37,610
we can stay relevant. The last pillar

335
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,002
that you can use to lead your remote teams

336
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:47,118
is to retain your team or to keep your team.

337
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:50,240
Hold them close and you might be thinking.

338
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,194
Amber Vanderburg my team members get to stay

339
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:57,678
at home in their pajamas. They have a flexible work schedule.

340
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,198
Why would they ever leave? I hate

341
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:05,670
to break it to you, but you're not the only team that

342
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,694
offers remote work. See,

343
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:12,662
it's so important in this time that we keep

344
00:22:12,716 --> 00:22:16,310
retention at the forefront of our conversation,

345
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,934
even in, especially in remote teams.

346
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:24,982
See, retention in remote teams probably won't

347
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:28,554
come from an over annoyance from the

348
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:32,622
person down the hall or the person in the cube next to me that

349
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:36,394
is talking loud on the phone and eating chips very loudly

350
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:40,014
every day. It probably won't stem from that, but it

351
00:22:40,052 --> 00:22:43,140
might stem from a few other ways.

352
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,974
And like in your recruiting process, relationships require

353
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:52,722
a lot of communication see, as we are

354
00:22:52,776 --> 00:22:56,166
building our team and valuing our team and training our team,

355
00:22:56,268 --> 00:23:00,134
there's one constant that is a

356
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:05,154
thread within all of these pillars and that is building relationships,

357
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:09,400
building quality, intentional relationships and

358
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,610
being intentional. And I mean quality communication.

359
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,170
See, this is a place for digital communication.

360
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,394
One of my favorite authors and leaders, Dr. Mark Rutland,

361
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:26,030
writes that quality communication comes down to the right

362
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,486
message, to the right audience in the right way

363
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:33,582
at the right time. So it's important as you are leading your teams,

364
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:37,442
you're asking this quality question, right? Is this the

365
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:40,702
right message? Is this the message I should be delivering?

366
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:44,340
Is this the right audience? Are the right people

367
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,278
at the table? Are the wrong people at the table? Right. So we're going

368
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:51,298
to assess are the rightfit people at the table?

369
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:55,654
Next, is, is this the best way to

370
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:59,162
deliver my communication? And this is really

371
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:03,558
important. See, oftentimes there's a lot of attention

372
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:07,402
given to the actual message, but not

373
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:10,490
enough given to the actual method.

374
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:14,910
And the method of your communication is so critical.

375
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:19,280
Generally, whenever I work with teams, we discuss

376
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,778
how many emails or how many texts it'll take to

377
00:24:23,864 --> 00:24:28,210
solve the challenge, to come up with an answer before

378
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,290
it's important for us to pick up the phone or get on a Zoom meeting.

379
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,466
Generally with most teams it's about five to seven. So an

380
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:39,986
average of six. So an average of six emails

381
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:44,146
going back and forth. If it's going to take ten emails,

382
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:48,174
if it's going to take 15 emails for us going back and forth

383
00:24:48,242 --> 00:24:51,606
to come up with a solution, then email probably isn't

384
00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:55,194
the best method of communication for us to use.

385
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:58,714
We should probably go to a different form of

386
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:01,774
communication. And this does a couple of different things.

387
00:25:01,972 --> 00:25:05,870
First, it allows you to get answers quicker,

388
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,526
which is something that we all would love to do rightfit. So being able to

389
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:14,962
get those answers more efficiently and so that is super

390
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:18,802
important in itself. But even more so on the relationship

391
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:22,514
side. Whenever you are delivering a

392
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:27,030
message and there is a span of time in between each

393
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:31,254
message in the correspondence, there is a span of time

394
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:34,534
for emotions to build and there's a span of

395
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:37,782
time for the words to sink in. Now,

396
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,318
this is really, really desired. Whenever you are sending,

397
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,714
say, love letters, see, there is a span of

398
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,814
time between each letter for the words to sink

399
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:51,534
in, for the emotion to build, but it

400
00:25:51,572 --> 00:25:55,466
is not as desired of a products.

401
00:25:55,578 --> 00:25:58,330
If we are talking about something that is more technical,

402
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,082
maybe something that has an emotion that is not affection,

403
00:26:03,226 --> 00:26:06,926
but could be a little bit more tense or more challenging, and having a span

404
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:10,754
of time in between each email can result in

405
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:14,178
some avoidable tension within teams. So it's important

406
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:17,846
to be intentional about the method of communication that you

407
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:22,102
are using. In the same regard, there are some phone

408
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:26,514
calls, stand ups, in person meetings, or zoom meetings.

409
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:30,106
That could be an email, it could be

410
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:33,654
a text, it could be a memo. So generally,

411
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:37,734
whenever I work with teams on deciding the best method of communication,

412
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:42,382
I actually look at the responses and does

413
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:46,158
this require a response? Is it going to be just a

414
00:26:46,164 --> 00:26:49,834
couple of responses or is this going to be a long thread

415
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:53,714
of communication and correspondence? And then you can decide your

416
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:57,566
method of communication there the best method of communication

417
00:26:57,678 --> 00:27:01,026
from that. And then the last factor is,

418
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:05,102
is this the right time to deliver this

419
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:08,966
message? See, it's important that we be personal

420
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:10,950
and that we be professional.

421
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,174
Now, in our professional lives, we have

422
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:21,334
a lot of messages that tell us to be very brief,

423
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:25,782
but let us not conflate our brief communication

424
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:29,066
with clear communication. And the time that

425
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:32,714
you save in fewer words typed

426
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:36,206
could actually result, it could

427
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,998
result in more time being spent by the team trying to

428
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:43,854
figure out what you actually meant and then misinterpreting

429
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:47,154
it. So it's really critical in those

430
00:27:47,192 --> 00:27:50,626
memos and in those texts and in those emails that we

431
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:53,730
are very clear in our communication.

432
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,894
So don't bombard your team with a lot

433
00:27:57,932 --> 00:28:01,506
of messages that are conflating that brief

434
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:04,822
communication with clear communication. So we want to be very

435
00:28:04,876 --> 00:28:08,790
clear in the communication that we are building

436
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,434
also. So that's one way that we can really keep our

437
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:15,610
team is to provide clarity.

438
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,042
And that seems very simple. But by providing

439
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:25,162
clarity in our communication, in our leadership,

440
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:28,366
in our job on what I'm actually going to do,

441
00:28:28,468 --> 00:28:32,754
that can eliminate so much frustration and tension within

442
00:28:32,792 --> 00:28:36,574
our team, people will more than likely

443
00:28:36,622 --> 00:28:40,674
want to stay there. Right. We want to stay in a place that has

444
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:43,010
that clarity within our teams.

445
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,822
Also create opportunities for

446
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:51,542
growth within your remote teams. Now see,

447
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:55,110
whenever I am joining a remote team, whenever we have people

448
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,650
that are joining remote teams, there still is that

449
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,938
drive, especially if you are recruiting hungry people, a drive to

450
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:07,660
move up in the ladder. So make sure to offer those

451
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,678
continuous opportunities for growth. Yes, in the training,

452
00:29:11,764 --> 00:29:15,486
we're growing in our skill and in our talent, but in the

453
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:19,514
retention efforts offer opportunities for growth

454
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:23,002
within the organization and within the company. Now,

455
00:29:23,076 --> 00:29:26,754
whenever I work with teams, we actually look for

456
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:30,722
flexibility on a ladder scale. So moving

457
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:33,906
vertically, but also moving horizontally as well. So if

458
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:37,510
someone is not happy in their position, they have a lot of different options

459
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,774
that they can go to throughout the organization to

460
00:29:42,812 --> 00:29:44,310
really be successful,

461
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:50,362
offer those opportunities for growth and offer some sort

462
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:54,378
of a timeline expectation within

463
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:58,714
your employees, for your employees that are wanting to

464
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:03,230
move within the communication, that are changing to grow within the organization

465
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,118
and that are truly wanting to bring success

466
00:30:07,284 --> 00:30:11,998
within your team. So going

467
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:16,146
to go through the four pillars one more time and

468
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:18,980
see these pillars are so important.

469
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,042
It reminds me of one time I was actually working

470
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:26,546
with a team in India. I was actually a football coach or

471
00:30:26,568 --> 00:30:29,694
a soccer coach for Paris Saint Germain or PSG

472
00:30:29,742 --> 00:30:32,966
academies in Bengalur, India. And I

473
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:36,470
recall one time I was coaching a very young

474
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,722
team and a young lad ran out onto the field.

475
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:43,350
He was about six years old and it was his first day of football.

476
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,666
And so he came running out onto the field and

477
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:47,930
he began yelling,

478
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,722
pass. And I noticed

479
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:57,582
that he was yelling, pass even whenever the other team

480
00:30:57,636 --> 00:31:00,894
had the ball. And he was yelling, pass when

481
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:04,606
he was miles away from the action. And he was yelling,

482
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:07,870
pass even whenever he had the ball.

483
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,558
And so he was running with the ball yelling,

484
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:12,020
pass. Pass.

485
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,438
And so I asked him, I said, why are

486
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:22,402
you yelling pass? And he said, miss Ember,

487
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:26,360
I do not know what it means. I only know it as a football word.

488
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,014
And sometimes I hear organizations, I can hear leaders

489
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:34,806
sound a little bit like my young soccer

490
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:37,930
player friend yelling, build your team.

491
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,970
Recruitment, collaborate, compensation,

492
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,446
retention, innovation, yelling all of

493
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:48,222
these words because we know that they are really good words

494
00:31:48,356 --> 00:31:51,966
that can lead to big goals. But if we're in the wrong

495
00:31:52,068 --> 00:31:55,650
position, if we're miles away from the action,

496
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,566
or if we even have the ball and we don't know in which direction we're

497
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:04,158
going, then saying these words are not only ineffective,

498
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:07,842
but they're actually detrimental to the overall communication

499
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:11,718
within your team. But if

500
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:15,160
we take the time to build our team

501
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,954
very intentionally, by finding team members that

502
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:22,086
are humble and are hungry and are smart,

503
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:25,946
if we take the time to value our teams

504
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:29,654
being very catered to the value and intentional

505
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:33,534
value that we can bring to our remote team members in

506
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:36,894
a creative and personal way, if we take the time

507
00:32:36,932 --> 00:32:40,586
to train our team in new best practices

508
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:44,506
and new growth opportunities in talent and in skills,

509
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:48,206
so we can stay competitive and we can stay relevant, and if we

510
00:32:48,228 --> 00:32:51,534
are intentional to retain our team and to keep our

511
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:54,966
teams by provide a more

512
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:58,418
efficient and a more effective and a more enjoyable

513
00:32:58,514 --> 00:33:01,878
workplace, then we'll be in a position

514
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:05,830
to yell pass to receive the ball,

515
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,846
to move forward and to score really

516
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:13,414
big goals. Welcome to the

517
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:16,754
future of work. Let's go score some goals

518
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:16,900
today.
