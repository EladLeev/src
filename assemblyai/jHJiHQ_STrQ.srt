00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,678
Hi folks, my name is Yasir and I'd like to invite you to my talk

2
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:46,214
positive and constructive feedback and how you

3
00:00:46,252 --> 00:00:49,446
had it all wrong. Here is a quick glimpse at

4
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:53,694
the agenda them I'll start off with an introduction of myself so

5
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,720
that you know who's talking to you and why you should listen to me.

6
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,442
I will introduce the concept of the standards devotion matrix

7
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:04,450
and say a few words on inquiry and feedback on different cultures.

8
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,094
I will then reframe the word feedback

9
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:12,254
into slightly different terms. Afterwards, I will summarize

10
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:15,794
the learnings from this talk and send you off on your way with

11
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:18,790
some homework to put those learnings into practice.

12
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,254
So first off, a few words about myself. I have over nine years

13
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,950
of professional experience with the past five years

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,770
spent as a cloud engineering manager at Pega.

15
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,506
I am a graduate of the leadership consortium, which is a course

16
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:38,166
taught by Harvard Business School professors with very practical learnings

17
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,306
for your professional and daily life. And I rely

18
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:44,080
very heavily on this talk on the learnings from that course.

19
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,886
Last year I was named as top 100 women in

20
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:53,466
cloud computing in Poland. I hold a master's

21
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:56,654
degree in machine learning, which is such a catchy topic

22
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:59,620
recently that I felt compelled to include this information.

23
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,886
And privately, I am an avid natural language learner

24
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:07,846
with seven and counting and a proud bomb to a beautiful son and the

25
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:11,366
cutest cat. So let's now get into the meat of

26
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:15,670
the talk. Let's talk about the standards devotion matrix.

27
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,594
This is a concept that is going to help you locate yourself

28
00:02:19,712 --> 00:02:24,042
in relation to the people around you in terms of your

29
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:28,054
standards for them, how high your standards

30
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:32,106
are and what you expect from them, and in terms of your devotion

31
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:35,998
to them, essentially how much you care about them

32
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:39,726
being successful, or how much they feel

33
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:42,830
that you care about them being successful.

34
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,214
And we're going to go through each quadrant

35
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:50,962
one by one and to see some of the behaviors you might

36
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:54,530
exhibit when you land in each of the quadrants.

37
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,590
So let's start with the bottom left quadrant.

38
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,642
Your standards are low for the people and your devotion

39
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:06,466
is very low. This is called neglect. The behaviors

40
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:10,646
you might exhibit would be essentially not paying attention,

41
00:03:10,838 --> 00:03:14,602
not caring about what work they're doing or how

42
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:18,570
they're doing it. And I'm not going to spend time

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,430
here because this is a situation that arises very, very rarely

44
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,686
and is not necessarily a place where you want to end

45
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,934
up in far more frequently. You will end

46
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:33,790
up in the top left corner, which is called severity,

47
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,180
which means that your standards for the people around you are very high,

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,546
but your devotion to them is very low. So they

49
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:46,246
do not necessarily feel that you are deeply devoted to

50
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:49,990
their success. And this is a situation

51
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,226
that you frequently have with your peers. There is this phenomena

52
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:57,640
called peer bias when you expect

53
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,914
far more from your peers than from someone on

54
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:05,882
higher or lower level than you. Oh, I'm working so much.

55
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,486
I'm doing so much. Why aren't you

56
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:13,194
you doing as much as I'm doing? On the opposite

57
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:17,422
side is the bottom right quadrant, where people

58
00:04:17,476 --> 00:04:20,240
feel that you are deeply devoted to their success,

59
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,970
but you're not necessarily setting very high standards for them.

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,254
This is called fidelity, and honestly,

61
00:04:28,382 --> 00:04:30,740
this is a little bit too kind.

62
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,006
So you're not expecting them to do a lot

63
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:38,550
of work. You're making sure that they're comfortable. And people

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,486
tend to stagnate with you when you

65
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:46,562
fall into this quadrant because they're not growing

66
00:04:46,706 --> 00:04:49,370
as individuals, they're not growing as professionals.

67
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,538
The situation you want to end up in is,

68
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:58,010
of course, as in any matrix, the top right quadrant.

69
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,382
Valerius Maximus, a greek philosopher, called this

70
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:06,138
justice, and Anne Morris and Francis Fry,

71
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:10,000
whose book you will find in my sources, called this love.

72
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,586
This is a place where you have high standards for

73
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:17,380
people and they feel that you are deeply devoted to their success.

74
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,650
Ideally, you will end up in this category with your direct reports,

75
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,690
but human nature has it slightly different

76
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,214
things, making things hard for us. So normally people

77
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:33,858
oscillate between these two categories, oscillate between severity

78
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:37,320
and fidelity. It goes something like this.

79
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,526
You might start off in severity having very high standards

80
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:44,358
for people, and then people complain,

81
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:47,706
oh, you're pushing me too much.

82
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:51,238
I'm tired, I'm burning out. I can't take

83
00:05:51,264 --> 00:05:55,226
this anymore. There's too much on my plate. So subsequently,

84
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:58,622
you try to make people feel comfortable, you lower

85
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:03,098
your standards, you try to make sure that they're not overworked

86
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:06,594
and that they feel very at ease with

87
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,906
you. You're lowering your standards, and little by little you

88
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:13,554
end up in fidelity. Until one morning you wake up

89
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:17,298
and you say, okay, this is enough. No work is getting done anymore.

90
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:21,170
I need to increase my standards again. And boom,

91
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,678
you end up back in severity. So how do

92
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:28,854
you break this loop? How do you move along the axis of devotion?

93
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:32,746
And how do you move along the axis of standards where there

94
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:36,682
are two components to this? If you want to increase your

95
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:40,246
devotion, you do that through inquiry, and I'll

96
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:44,158
talk about that in a second. And if you want to increase your

97
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,774
standards, you do that through feedback. The main

98
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:51,726
topic of this talk, which I will delve into in

99
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:55,966
a couple of slides. So let's start off with the devotion

100
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,690
axis and inquiry.

101
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,914
So when you want to reveal your

102
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:06,260
devotion, you essentially are going to ask people questions,

103
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,078
how can I help you be the most successful or best self?

104
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:13,800
How can they provide more opportunity for you?

105
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,834
More and more and more questions you ask, the more they're going

106
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:21,082
to feel that you truly, really deeply care

107
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:24,570
about their success and about them as individuals.

108
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,130
And remember, the currency of love is attention.

109
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,614
So before we move on to talking about

110
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:37,918
feedback and different components of feedback, I want to say a few

111
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,594
words about the cultural aspect. So Erin

112
00:07:41,642 --> 00:07:45,394
Mayer performed a lot of research in terms

113
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:48,850
of culture and the role of feedback in different cultures.

114
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,802
And she drew this axis with direct

115
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:56,254
negative feedback on one end and indirect negative feedback

116
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:59,574
on the opposite end. So essentially, you will

117
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,694
have some countries, some cultures where

118
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,214
straight off the band, people are going to be very direct and

119
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,900
they're going to tell you straight up what you're doing wrong.

120
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,730
Netherlands is going to be on the complete

121
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,094
opposite end of indirect negative feedback, sitting very hardly

122
00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:25,034
indirect feedback. A person from Netherlands

123
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:28,654
is going to tell you very, very clearly what you're doing

124
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:32,206
wrong, and they're going to do that in front of a group of

125
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:35,250
people. And nobody's going to consider this route.

126
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,866
Japan, for instance, sits on the opposite side

127
00:08:38,888 --> 00:08:42,414
of the spectrum, where a japanese

128
00:08:42,462 --> 00:08:46,466
person will never dream about telling

129
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:49,506
you something directly negative,

130
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:53,154
but you will have to listen in the things they're

131
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:56,566
not saying for the things that you need

132
00:08:56,588 --> 00:09:00,214
to improve on. And us sits

133
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:04,234
somewhere in the middle a little bit, leaning into the

134
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:08,154
indirect negative feedback, for instance, with the very,

135
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:11,802
very famous compliment sandwich technique,

136
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:15,518
which, by the way, you should never use.

137
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:19,200
But this is not quite the topic of this particular talk.

138
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,050
So I want to reframe this a little bit into

139
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,838
terms that will allow you to give feedback

140
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:31,314
very accurately, no matter

141
00:09:31,512 --> 00:09:35,266
the culture. So we're going to divide

142
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:38,914
feedback into two categories. There's positive

143
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:41,750
reinforcement and there's constructive advice,

144
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,374
and I am going to portray the difference between the

145
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:49,590
two right now. So essentially,

146
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,466
positive reinforcement is catching somebody doing something well

147
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:58,134
and telling them, do more of this. And constructive

148
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,360
advice is catching someone doing something

149
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,686
not quite well and telling them,

150
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:08,110
you know what? Do this a little differently.

151
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,406
And when it comes to timing, for positive reinforcement,

152
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:16,334
usually 12 seconds is sufficient to provide positive reinforcement.

153
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:20,610
And for constructive advice, at most 10 seconds,

154
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,900
it has to be very short. 10 seconds is quite enough.

155
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,790
Positive reinforcement is going to be very specific and sincere.

156
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,320
And constructive advice, again, has to be very specific.

157
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,782
Can't be, oh, this is all terrible.

158
00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:44,086
You have to pick up on a specific action

159
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:47,900
or activity with the people that you're talking to,

160
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,330
and it has to be non judgmental but developmental.

161
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,934
So essentially I am telling you this for the sake of

162
00:10:55,972 --> 00:11:01,326
your development, for the sake of your success and

163
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:05,490
positive reinforcement, you're going to give all the time and

164
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,586
constructive advice you're going to give ASAP after

165
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:13,054
you have noticed that particular activity

166
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:17,160
that you want fixing. And the reason why I'm saying

167
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,606
give positive reinforcement all the time is that there

168
00:11:21,628 --> 00:11:25,542
is a specific ratio of these

169
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:28,746
two between these two that is needed

170
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:32,666
to make this successful. And the ratio is

171
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:36,266
five to one. So essentially, in order to

172
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:39,846
be able to give constructive advice that is going to guide

173
00:11:39,878 --> 00:11:43,738
the person, to stir the person in the right direction,

174
00:11:43,914 --> 00:11:47,534
you need to have built a foundation of

175
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:51,470
positive reinforcement to give yourself credibility.

176
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,554
If you're going to only give constructive advice, then the person is

177
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:59,134
going to say, oh, they're never noticing

178
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:02,290
the good things that I'm doing, they're only focusing on the bad.

179
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,570
I'm not going to take this very seriously,

180
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,342
but if you give positive reinforcement very

181
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,550
frequently, this will give you credibility.

182
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,618
This will give your worst credibility that,

183
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,874
okay, this person is noticing not only the difficult

184
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,660
things but also the positive things.

185
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,446
And essentially the five to one ratio means that if

186
00:12:30,468 --> 00:12:34,222
you want to give constructive advice once

187
00:12:34,276 --> 00:12:38,014
a day, you have to give positive reinforcement five times

188
00:12:38,052 --> 00:12:41,358
a day. If you want to give constructive advice once a

189
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:45,374
month, you need to give positive

190
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:48,100
reinforcement once a week and so on.

191
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,082
But the reason why you need to start giving

192
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:55,782
positive reinforcement straight away and all the time is

193
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:59,206
because you need to give constructive advice as

194
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,870
soon as possible. And if you do not have that foundation built

195
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,278
up, it is not going to be effective.

196
00:13:07,474 --> 00:13:10,950
So be very keen

197
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,314
to remember this ratio. So to

198
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:17,606
sum up, we talked about the standards devotion matrix.

199
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:21,578
We delved into how to move along the axis of the

200
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:24,694
matrix and get into the justice and love category

201
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:28,046
with inquiry and feedback. We talked about being

202
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:32,122
mindful about cultural differences and we introduce the concept

203
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,170
of positive reinforcement and constructive advice.

204
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,130
Now on to the homework.

205
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,970
So first off, my task for you is to find yourself

206
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,990
on the standards devotion matrix. What is the default for you?

207
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,014
Find yourself in all categories with whom you are,

208
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:52,534
in which quadrants. The second task is

209
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:56,600
to reveal your devotion. So ask questions.

210
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,002
The more you ask, the more you're going to build up on

211
00:14:01,056 --> 00:14:05,046
that devotion quality. And the third task

212
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:07,610
is to practice giving constructive advice.

213
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,760
And you can come up to a friend and tell them,

214
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,614
you know what, I'm going to practice this. I'm going to practice giving

215
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:18,560
you very specific, short,

216
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,474
sincere, non judgmental,

217
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:26,178
constructive advice. I might not be great at it at first,

218
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:29,954
but I need to practice to be better. So please help

219
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:33,380
me practice with that. I'm going to

220
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,450
showcase you my sources.

221
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,226
It's a book called Unleashed by Frances

222
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,990
Rye and Anne Morris of the Leadership Consortium.

223
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,390
It is a book of memorable deeds and saying by

224
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,826
Valeris Maximus and the Culture mob by Erin

225
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:55,666
Mayer. If you want to get some additional reading

226
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:59,142
on feedback, Marcus Buckingham has a great book called

227
00:14:59,196 --> 00:15:02,494
Feedback Fallacy that I encourage you to check out.

228
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:05,806
Thank you so much for tuning in to my talk, and I hope

229
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:10,110
you enjoy the rest of the talks in Con 42

230
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,580
DevOps 2024 conference. Take care.
