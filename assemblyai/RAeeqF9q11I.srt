1
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,120
You.

2
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,006
Hello everybody. First of all,

3
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:37,302
thank you for inviting us to present in the

4
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:40,680
42 Devsecops 2023 event.

5
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,342
So today we are going to explain you a bit

6
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:48,214
about our case. And to do so, I'm having

7
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:51,434
here with me Sandeep Panghal, which is managing consultant

8
00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:54,906
within tcs and myself Juan Antonio Conde,

9
00:00:55,098 --> 00:00:59,182
head head head head head of application portfolio

10
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:02,894
composition. We enter into the

11
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:07,074
case. So let's provide a brief update on where

12
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:10,498
we are with who we are. So Zurich is a

13
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,018
little more deliveries insurance that serve its customer

14
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:18,486
in a global and local market. Funded in 1872

15
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:21,874
with about 56,000 employees, it provides

16
00:01:21,922 --> 00:01:25,366
a wide range of property and casualty and

17
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:29,734
life insurance products and services in more than 210 countries

18
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:32,890
and territories. Sandeep,

19
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:37,194
I will hand over to you to provide a brief update on Tata and then

20
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:41,054
we can go into the case. Yeah, Tata Tata Tata

21
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:44,398
Tata Consultancy Services World renowned Tata Group is a

22
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,394
global it services consulting and business solution provider

23
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,902
who has been building greater futures through innovations and

24
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:55,098
knowledge for over 50 plus years. So we have

25
00:01:55,124 --> 00:01:58,354
been recommended has a top two most valuable brand in

26
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:01,522
2022 with a market capitalization of

27
00:02:01,576 --> 00:02:05,534
144 billion with a revenue of 25 plus billion

28
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:08,934
dollars in FY 2022. So we are

29
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:12,994
a company of 600,000 plus employees representing

30
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:16,582
150 plus nationalities with a 35

31
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,202
plus diversity percentage. So we are a company

32
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:24,166
who has spreaded its wings across all the industries ranging

33
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:26,090
from BFSI, retail,

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,486
manufacturing. So whatever you name it, TCS is

35
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,922
there with BFSI predominantly dominating

36
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:38,794
in the revenue market. So if I talk about from the geographical

37
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:42,590
area. So we have spread it across the globe with the major

38
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,094
businesses working, coming from the North America followed

39
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:49,330
by Europe, continental Europe as well as the Asia.

40
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,186
So we have been ranked as a top 20

41
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:57,186
future brand in the index 2021 and has been ranked

42
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:01,318
as a top hundred as a leader by the research

43
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:04,520
firms. Moving on.

44
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,374
Basically now I will be giving you a walkthrough about our automated Devsecops

45
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:15,754
maturity assessment, about the background, basically how we came

46
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:19,894
out talk about this solution. So basically here is our CTO

47
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:23,646
or CIO of an organization who is thinking that how

48
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:27,546
do I know about Devsecops adoption of the business unit functions

49
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:30,846
or the entire organization? How matured am

50
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:34,990
I organization in Devsecops with respect to industry standards?

51
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,946
How do I compare business units in terms of

52
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:42,754
future investment? Which business units, applications or

53
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,470
the platforms are less efficient with lower

54
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,818
quality and lower production deliveries and the vice versa?

55
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:54,530
Where I need to invest more? How can I benchmark

56
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,330
each business unit application or the functions against

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,314
each other or with other insurance providers or

58
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:05,610
moreover with other industries. Can I have

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,620
some kind of a point in time?

60
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,134
Dashboards, automated continuous dashboard with

61
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,814
neo human error. So this

62
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:20,458
was the background. Now, if I talk about the problem statement,

63
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:23,954
there are no standard setup developed matrices which

64
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:27,666
can be applied across the business units which have been

65
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:31,522
globally spreaded across the different countries for

66
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:36,402
using. And there isn't any harmonization of the Devsecops

67
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:39,686
adoption view of the organizationbusiness and

68
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:43,330
the matrices which are being produced with the big manual efforts

69
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,390
due to the multiple data sources,

70
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,310
due to the complexities of the various applications,

71
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,930
diverse landscapes and the tools used across the various business

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,566
units. And the teams are focusing on introducing mattresses

73
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,858
and the measurement rather than on the production deliveries.

74
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:05,486
So in order to resolve this problem, here we have Juan who will be

75
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:09,342
talking about the solution. So yeah, so Sandeep went

76
00:05:09,396 --> 00:05:12,822
through the problem statement. What were the major headaches

77
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:16,606
that it brings to our organization?

78
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:19,842
But I'm pretty sure that that's something

79
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:23,182
that is common across quite a lot of companies worldwide,

80
00:05:23,326 --> 00:05:26,760
especially if they are big corporations. So after

81
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,238
many different meetings with quite a lot of different stakeholders across

82
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:35,430
Zurich, but also we engage with many different partners

83
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,402
to confirm the direction to follow. So we have been talking with key

84
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:42,950
reference partners and consultant firms around the globe.

85
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,602
So it came up on the solution has indeed said that we need to build

86
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:50,686
something that brings automation on

87
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,398
how we produce metrics that is tool agnostic and

88
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:57,838
just provide the metrics that we

89
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:01,614
require, but also providing the flexibility in case

90
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,266
that we need to adjust the metrics. And here it is where data hoop,

91
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,694
which is the product that we have built from scratch,

92
00:06:07,822 --> 00:06:11,186
is coming into the picture. So first of

93
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,514
all we thought, okay, so how we are going to be building something new.

94
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:18,210
Of course this needs to be cloud based, needs to be scalable,

95
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,738
agnostic of technologies, underlying technologies,

96
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:26,326
but of course flexible enough to integrate with

97
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:29,866
the different DevOps tools that we are having in the

98
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:32,694
market. Also code quality tools,

99
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:36,186
security testing tools, different testing tools that we

100
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,850
can incorporate into data hook in terms of data points

101
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,890
or metadata retrieve from data hook.

102
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,566
In one side we have the technology, but in the other side we have been

103
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:50,878
designing data hook with the customer in mind. So of course we have

104
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:54,926
been applying design thinking and user experience principles.

105
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,770
It has been secured by design. So in the sense that we

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,582
protect the business units,

107
00:07:01,646 --> 00:07:05,174
data or group data to don't be shared with others, at least

108
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:09,080
that we are interested providing benchmarks also from

109
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,554
global organization to the business units to the teams

110
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:17,238
without compromising that anonymization of data

111
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:21,082
to be presented from one group to another. It has been

112
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:24,614
also user friendly error

113
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:28,070
reports produced in order to make business units

114
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,770
application teams understand why they are not

115
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,262
seeing their data within the dashboard, how they can

116
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:38,606
improve the way that they are doing things. All right? And this has been

117
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:42,486
the main purpose of data hook. So create a tool that provides

118
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:46,110
the application team, the business units it heads,

119
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,194
but also the group leaders information about how we

120
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:53,746
are doing developed in our corporation. So what

121
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,570
is our development efficiency?

122
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,966
So the benefits that data hoop brings to organization. And you

123
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:04,326
can see some of them here on

124
00:08:04,348 --> 00:08:08,354
this slide. And I have been referring to some of those already. So faster agile

125
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:12,070
adoption. So of course, I'm pretty sure that many big corporations

126
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:15,798
like us can think, hey, how agile is our organization?

127
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:19,718
How many agile applications do we have? Right? So with Datacoop,

128
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:23,226
we have been able to not only identify how our teams

129
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:26,926
are applying those agile behaviors on the different tools that

130
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:30,574
we are using to do software development, but also to do

131
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:34,366
project management. We have been also able to incorporate

132
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,774
other disciplines like how automated

133
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:41,422
processes are, how we are doing testing

134
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:46,194
across the different applications and teams. Right? So once

135
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:49,666
you know the data, of course you can improve, which is describe the continuously

136
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:53,206
improvement behavior. But as I mentioned earlier, so that allow us

137
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:56,982
really to compare with the different units, the different

138
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,346
teams, and not just with the aim of knowing where

139
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:03,530
we are, also with the aim of course, always to improve.

140
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,498
And of course last but not least, so we

141
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:10,606
have been able to produce metric at

142
00:09:10,628 --> 00:09:14,094
a scale almost with no effort or with

143
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:17,920
a very little effort on the team side. All right.

144
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,734
The outcome up to date about what we have done. So here

145
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:26,322
you have some figures so we have implemented or we have onboarded within data

146
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:29,826
hook. I would say that right now it's a

147
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:33,234
bit more than 200 applications from twelve business units has been

148
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,594
assessed. The monthly onboarding

149
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,680
ratio is about 20% plus 20%.

150
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,126
The onboarding process for new application is automated through

151
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:49,274
Azure pipeline. So almost an onboarding of an application can be

152
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:53,254
performed without any manual intervention. Metrics related

153
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,810
to customer value, organizational effectiveness, service quality,

154
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,886
measurement areas continuously from several tool sets.

155
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:04,606
So we are retrieving data on a regular basis, on a monthly basis and we

156
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,630
are producing those metrics to our different teams,

157
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,934
global business units and department benchmark is available for

158
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:15,406
test, SEc ops adoption, maturity assessment.

159
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:19,122
Lead time to market KPIs decreased by 9%

160
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:22,546
over the last nine months. So we're here becoming faster. So this is

161
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:26,898
going back to the continuous improvement that we have seen on

162
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:30,742
the previous slide and then also we have identified up to 10%

163
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:34,342
month to month increase in technical, therefore 20 plus

164
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:38,182
business areas over the last year. So those numbers areas

165
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:42,610
just reflecting the adoption of data who within Zurich.

166
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,030
And this well is more to come within the next

167
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,006
months and years. So hopefully this has been something interesting

168
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,590
for you. Thank you very much for listening us

169
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,426
and if you are interested to know a bit more about data hook.

170
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,966
So here you have our email address. Feel free to reach out.

171
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:05,710
I will be more than happy to get in contact with you

172
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:09,386
and to provide more details about how we have implemented

173
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,660
data hook in our corporation. Thank you very much.
