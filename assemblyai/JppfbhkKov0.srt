00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,126
Hi. This short talk is to share with you some peculiarities of

2
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:27,720
the quantum computer word that I've noticed over the years.

3
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,698
In the three years that I've been involved in quantum computing,

4
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,994
I collaborated with, learned from, and tutored

5
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:37,970
people of all ages, genders, cultures,

6
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,770
religions and backgrounds. But I've also

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,462
been in context where the majority of people were male,

8
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:48,170
heterosexual, white and cisgender.

9
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,194
It was useful to observe those difference between those contexts

10
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:56,906
and those inclusive ones. In the former,

11
00:00:57,018 --> 00:01:01,018
those air was stagnant, the interactions unproductive.

12
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,846
There was an atmosphere of competition and defense of own's

13
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:08,210
work that soon made them stale and obsolete.

14
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,034
Speeches were often dry discussions not aimed at

15
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,134
building something together. Speakers did

16
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:19,030
not aim at bringing something to others,

17
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,510
but at showing their superiority.

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,682
And those who ask questions were often not motivated

19
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:29,242
by real interest. On the contrary, they usually already

20
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:32,940
knew the answer, but wanted to show off to others.

21
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,614
I think that the key of the success of the inclusive

22
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,760
environments is the awareness of difference.

23
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,682
Knowing one's own physical and cognitive

24
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:50,720
peculiarities goes along with those respect of for others.

25
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,990
This leads to mutual consideration, open mindedness

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,940
and willingness to share one's work.

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,690
And that's for two reasons.

28
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,642
First, the knowledge and skills you build

29
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:08,194
during your life are unique. No one can steal

30
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:11,960
them from you, so don't be afraid to share them.

31
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,294
And second is that the collaboration is

32
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:19,770
crucial. It could be hard to go on

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,594
on your own. I learned a lot in

34
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:27,434
inclusive environments. On a technical and on a personal

35
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:30,826
level. People much more experienced

36
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:34,190
than me found time to listen to my doubts,

37
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,774
to explain what I did not understand

38
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:41,950
and guide me step by step in different aspects.

39
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,434
On the technical side, they taught me how to create

40
00:02:46,472 --> 00:02:50,178
a demo, but not with arrogance. They let

41
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:54,386
me make my own mistakes, highlighting them

42
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:58,354
and allowing me the time to learn and improve

43
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:02,006
from them. On the social

44
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:06,418
side, I found less technical people, but socially skilled,

45
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:10,122
who helped me build my network and figure out how

46
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:12,300
to move in such a fickle world.

47
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,574
I believe that the predisposition for inclusiveness

48
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:20,970
of such environments is rooted in two causes.

49
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,890
On the one end, we can observe that very slowly

50
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,710
our society is changing.

51
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,850
The push toward inclusiveness is getting stronger,

52
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,330
and we are beginning to see the first results.

53
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,694
On the other hand, it is related precisely to quantum

54
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:42,962
computing. Quantum technologies will

55
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:45,750
have a massive impact on our reality.

56
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,082
We already know that with sufficiently powerful quantum

57
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,414
computers, we will revolutionize many sectors with

58
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:57,094
radical impacts on our lives, just to

59
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:00,934
mention two of them. The discovery of new materials

60
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:04,918
to fight climate change and reduce our impact on planet Earth,

61
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:08,870
or the possibility of finding new medicines

62
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,190
for diseases now dreaded or incurable.

63
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,160
But those change needs to be addressed together.

64
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,502
We should not remain deaf to the lessons artificial

65
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:27,060
intelligence are imparting to us right now.

66
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,610
We are developing them poorly,

67
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,678
filling them with dangerous biases,

68
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:37,842
and failing to legislate and listen to those addressing

69
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:40,680
the ethical problems they might trying.

70
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,942
History has shown us over and over how

71
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:49,110
a new technology can be as wonderful,

72
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,282
if well managed, as fearsome if

73
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:56,090
misused. We need to develop

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,870
technologies in a more inclusive environment,

75
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,320
respectful of others. To have a broader view,

76
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,466
we should leverage on a diverse environment

77
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:11,118
and on the fact that new technologies cover different

78
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:13,140
aspects of our lives.

79
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,754
We can call in experts in different fields from all over the

80
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:22,670
world, from any culture or identity, because each background

81
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,738
can give different insights to the implementation

82
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,360
and use of technology.

83
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,446
An inclusive environment help us better

84
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:37,126
understand both how to harness it and how to

85
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:40,506
avoid gray areas that might backfire on

86
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:44,074
us, or at the very least, how to live as

87
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:45,180
few as possible.

88
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,246
Not only that, thinking about technology

89
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:54,906
even before it gets to the supremacy stage,

90
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:58,190
imagining how we can integrate it,

91
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,982
even visually into everyday life will save

92
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,260
us a lot of effort later.

93
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,126
Let's see just a few examples of the professions

94
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:14,706
that will be affected by the quantum computing revolution to

95
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:18,390
get an idea of the cross cutting nature of its

96
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,430
impacts.

97
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,114
Some of you may have already heard about post quantum

98
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:29,034
encryption. Many companies,

99
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:32,460
particularly banks or those involved in security,

100
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,934
are already taking steps to make their data secure

101
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:41,002
to possible decryption attacks that will come with quantum

102
00:06:41,066 --> 00:06:44,862
algorithms. Data that has been

103
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:49,290
or is being stolen now, even if not decryptable

104
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,214
at the moment, will most likely become decryptable

105
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:56,594
in a few years, so it is necessary to

106
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:58,130
move in anticipation.

107
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,954
One aspect that we are considering, much less is

108
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:08,150
quantum readiness to data management and architectures.

109
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,462
Even with quantum computers ready on real use

110
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,560
cases, we might not be able to use Azis data.

111
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,734
We often have outdated architectures and data cataloging

112
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:26,310
systems that are already struggling to be optimized

113
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,722
on current systems. Those will

114
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:33,950
make it impossible to use quantum algorithms on such structures.

115
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,234
It is time to adapt them and be ready to incorporate

116
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:41,200
quantum solutions when they become available.

117
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,194
Another area that will be involved will

118
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,210
be graphics and interfaces.

119
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,970
Quantum systems will have to be usable,

120
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,386
so it is important to create integrated interfaces

121
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:59,766
between classical and quantum systems to

122
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:04,134
ease the transition. And finally,

123
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:07,646
the trying of technology translations figures

124
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,370
is becoming increasingly crucial.

125
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,214
That is, those figures who have hybrid knowledge

126
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:20,370
both of quantum computing and other fields such as finance,

127
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,062
chemistry, telecommunications and so

128
00:08:24,116 --> 00:08:28,014
on. We need them in order to

129
00:08:28,052 --> 00:08:31,326
facilitate and optimize communication between

130
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,910
experts in quantum solutions and those in the various

131
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,322
fields of application and

132
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,842
we need them to understand when and how to apply

133
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,382
quantum technologies. We should look

134
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:49,334
back at artificial intelligence and see how using

135
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:53,410
it with out of control hype

136
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,720
has led to its indiscriminate, even inappropriate application

137
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,500
resulting in wasted money and time.

138
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,434
And for quantum technologies this issue will be

139
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:11,690
even more relevant. In conclusion,

140
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,838
over the years I've learned from and collaborated with

141
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:18,480
people older and younger than me,

142
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,160
with male, female and queer people,

143
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:25,646
with Christians, jewish, Muslim,

144
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:29,870
hindu and artist people, with people in physics,

145
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,806
mathematics, business, comics, chemistry and graphic

146
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:37,654
design. And in my experience I

147
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:41,894
can tell you that not only it is possible to create more

148
00:09:41,932 --> 00:09:45,334
inclusive work environments and make the most of

149
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,800
them, but it is already happening.

150
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,534
Please feel free to reach out to me on

151
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:56,674
social networks if you would like to talk about quantum technological

152
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,934
and social revolution or if you have any

153
00:10:00,012 --> 00:10:04,030
ups about this talk. Thank you for listening and happy

154
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,220
learning.
