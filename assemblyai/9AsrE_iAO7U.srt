1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,438
You. Hi everyone,

2
00:00:28,604 --> 00:00:32,626
thank you for joining in this talk about platform engineering adoption.

3
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:36,198
I hope you will enjoy and learn a lot from my

4
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:40,466
presentation. So let's start. I have prepared

5
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:44,134
today for you a talk about three practices that

6
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:48,166
will ensure the success behind platform

7
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,722
engineering adoption and make it more smooth.

8
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:55,086
Right. This is based on my experience and why

9
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,480
I feel confident to talk about this to you.

10
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,890
Well, during my years

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,686
working, I had the chance to work in Red Hat enabling

12
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:10,546
stream alignment teams and also platform teams. I worked in

13
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:14,130
the open innovation Labs team here in Ladam

14
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,210
delivering the DevOps mindset and practices

15
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,654
in different companies. And also in

16
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:24,966
my previous year I worked in display in the

17
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:28,522
global it center providing a

18
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,214
platform as a service for development

19
00:01:32,262 --> 00:01:36,154
teams, providing the platforms that will

20
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:39,730
help them implement DevOps practices like CACD

21
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,114
code versioning. So I participate

22
00:01:43,162 --> 00:01:47,134
and lead that platform team there. So all

23
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:51,566
the things I will talk for you today will

24
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:55,682
be based on this experience. So if you have questions or

25
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:59,106
doubts, just reach me out in the LinkedIn or you

26
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:03,026
can write me an email if you want. Right? So what

27
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:06,354
I have prepared for today is the three steps

28
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:10,754
presentation. First of all, we will go through what is platform engineering,

29
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:13,958
the what and why, why we should implement platform

30
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:17,946
engineering, what is the benefits? Then after

31
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:21,674
understanding the benefits of platform engineering, we will talk about the

32
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:25,402
challenges, the roadstones, because not all paths are

33
00:02:25,456 --> 00:02:29,162
easy, right? So it's important to understand them

34
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,874
and be cautious with them to avoid the typical

35
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:37,070
errors. Even when we are adopting other kind of cultures and practices,

36
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,480
some of them are very common between them.

37
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,542
And last but not least, we will talk about the three practices I

38
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:47,982
mentioned at the beginning break and the reason for this presentation.

39
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:52,370
To avoid the possibility to fail or

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,758
fall down with the rollstones, this path of platform

41
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:00,294
engineering adoption has. So let's start

42
00:03:00,332 --> 00:03:04,354
with the intro, the what and why of platform engineering.

43
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:07,914
So what is platform Engineering? It's a

44
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:13,510
discipline. This is the description you will be able to find in platformengineering.org

45
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,846
webpage. It was defined by Lucas

46
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,274
Galante, one of the leaders of platform engineering

47
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:25,914
movement. So he defines platform engineering

48
00:03:25,962 --> 00:03:29,022
as a discipline. Discipline is basically something that

49
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:32,266
several people is doing, doing, trying to implement,

50
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,066
right? But it's not just a discipline, it's a discipline of

51
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:39,378
designing and building toolchains and workflows. And when

52
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:43,442
he talks about workflows and tool chains, let's talk about first

53
00:03:43,496 --> 00:03:47,650
tool chains. Tool chains is a group of tools integrated

54
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,022
and fully configured to work together. And workflows means

55
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:55,510
how people work. So we are talking

56
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,846
about them together, right? The platform engineering practice

57
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:03,610
is focused on generate them together

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,862
to obviously enable self services capabilities

59
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:11,162
for software engineering organizations in this

60
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:14,862
cloud native era. So Lucas Galante was seeking to find

61
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:18,206
this thing for this definition of platform engineering to

62
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:21,854
make it understandable and generate this sharing understanding that is

63
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:25,374
a practice is the discipline of reducing

64
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:28,866
the cognitive load of the rest of the

65
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:32,702
teams to focus on their core business and have internal

66
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:36,854
customers using this platform as a self service

67
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:40,882
and reducing the possibilities of them to fail.

68
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:45,110
Because they need to learn and develop skills that are not focused on

69
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,934
or are not related with the core business they should be focusing.

70
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:53,674
Right? So why we

71
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:56,954
are looking for platform engineering? Why companies are

72
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:00,826
looking for platform engineering first of all is the standardization

73
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:04,814
and control. Because if you have all

74
00:05:04,852 --> 00:05:08,286
teams in your company working as they want or with

75
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,834
the tools they want, or even with the same tools,

76
00:05:11,882 --> 00:05:15,486
but implementing the tools as they can or as

77
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:18,522
they understand, it's difficult to maintain,

78
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:21,986
it's difficult to support at long

79
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:25,862
in the time, and also it's difficult to control how people

80
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:29,814
is managing these platforms to take the real profit and

81
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:33,042
to really implement the best practices.

82
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:36,966
All companies are trying to promote mainly behind the

83
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:40,646
concept of DevOps. So platform engineering

84
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:44,602
and DevOps will be very connected. Even some

85
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:48,214
speakers of platform engineering are saying that platform engineering

86
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:51,834
is the next level of DevOps. The next benefit

87
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:55,886
is reduction of cognitive load. The platform team

88
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,706
will focus on have the skills to prepare

89
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:03,086
the platforms for product teams and avoiding

90
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:06,594
them to have this knowledge that is not really

91
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,874
needed to build and deploy their

92
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,618
own applications, their own it core business.

93
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:17,202
So they will only will use in a smooth

94
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:20,694
way these platforms, reducing the knowledge they should

95
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:24,422
need or the expertise they should need to keep like

96
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:28,026
platforms of CI CD to run and build

97
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:32,022
their applications or platforms to deploy the applications

98
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:35,354
and manage the error environments. Also something that will

99
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:38,762
improve is the reliability and stability because

100
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,494
we will have an internal team focus on

101
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:46,234
the internal customer which will be these stream aligned teams,

102
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:50,302
dev teams or product teams. So they will focus to have a

103
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:54,494
real strong platform where the internal

104
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:57,970
customers will work over to promote a better

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,474
service for external users. So it

106
00:07:01,512 --> 00:07:04,974
has a lot of benefits for companies that are implementing,

107
00:07:05,022 --> 00:07:08,902
but it's not a smooth process. If you don't take

108
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:12,598
care of the main Roadstones, we will look here.

109
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:16,066
So if you want to go deeper before to go to the Roadstones,

110
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:19,674
if you want to go deeper on platform engineering, I will recommend these

111
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:23,638
talks that are available in the library

112
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:27,382
platform engineering YouTube

113
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:31,006
channel. First of all, Manuel Pay is one

114
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:35,134
of the writers of team

115
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:38,798
Topology's book were born this concept of platform

116
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:42,506
engine, platform teams. He talks

117
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:45,634
about what is a platform as a product and this is

118
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:49,118
one of the topics we will be talking here and is strongly

119
00:07:49,214 --> 00:07:52,846
related with one of the roadstones we need to identify

120
00:07:52,958 --> 00:07:56,402
and work on. The other one is Mayuri

121
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,750
Hyde is one of the collaborators of

122
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,758
Lucas Galante in this platform engineering community.

123
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:06,870
She's so smart and based

124
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,222
on her experience she talks about what's

125
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:14,838
happening with DevOps and platform engineering as practices,

126
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:18,394
as movement, how they work together and

127
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:22,094
finally, but it's really important, the state of

128
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:26,670
DevOps report for this year 2023, focus 100%

129
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,334
on platform engineering. So if you want to know more

130
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:34,418
how platform engineering is impacting in

131
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:37,662
the world, you can check the information in the DevOps

132
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,730
report. What are the Roadstones?

133
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,446
Where are the challenges behind platform engineering adoption?

134
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:50,022
Because sounds very great to have platform teams inside

135
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:53,474
my company taking care of platforms and solving

136
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:57,030
the live for my product teams and they will be able to focus

137
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,506
on only develop and build their applications without the

138
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:04,534
need to learn about how to implement CI CD or how to implement

139
00:09:04,662 --> 00:09:08,234
cloud native deployments. Everything will be ready for

140
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:12,078
them, right? How we can adopt this

141
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:15,760
way of working smoothly without

142
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:21,162
the failure that some companies had experienced

143
00:09:21,226 --> 00:09:24,658
in the past. So what are these problems?

144
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:28,866
Right. First of all, we need to understand that one

145
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:32,914
thing is what we believe, right? There is no easy path to

146
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:36,306
success. Everything we will do will have challenge.

147
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:39,762
So we need to take care of this, that platform engineering,

148
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:43,174
even when it sounds amazing as all

149
00:09:43,212 --> 00:09:46,950
the benefits it brings, it's important to understand

150
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,314
that it's not a smooth adoption, it's something that you

151
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:53,430
need to take care because will have a huge impact.

152
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,420
Because we are talking about teams that will focus in internal customers

153
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,422
and they will provide services for all platform, all product

154
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,242
teams that will be using their platforms

155
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:09,434
to build other platforms or applications to external

156
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:13,140
users. So it has a direct

157
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,370
impact on the business of a company,

158
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,522
even when it's for internal customers, right?

159
00:10:19,656 --> 00:10:23,074
So what are the main challenges? First of

160
00:10:23,112 --> 00:10:27,026
all, all companies are in the same path, right? They are lack

161
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:30,822
on time, but they are receiving high

162
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:34,742
demand. Anyone is with enough time

163
00:10:34,796 --> 00:10:38,518
to look at the applications or look at the platforms

164
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:42,374
in the infrastructure and take the time to solve

165
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:46,550
issues, solve bugs. They are all day working, they are delayed

166
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,786
on features, they are delayed in things they

167
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:53,434
need to do. So this is one of the main challenges in any adoption

168
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:56,654
processes and here with platform engineering is

169
00:10:56,692 --> 00:11:00,442
one of the possibilities to generate failures

170
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:04,500
in your path. The other thing is ways of working and thinking.

171
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,154
The companies that are implementing platform engineering is

172
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:12,642
something for medium and big companies, it's not

173
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:16,680
for small companies because in small companies there are

174
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,758
small teams. Truly 100% focus on

175
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:23,640
everything needed for their business, right.

176
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,170
Small companies will not spend in, have just one team

177
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,290
for internal customers and prepare platform for the rest.

178
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,538
When they have two or three or five teams inside,

179
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:40,022
or sometimes they are externalizing the service.

180
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:43,662
So when we are talking about big companies or medium companies,

181
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:47,086
we are talking about a big number,

182
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:51,294
huge number of teams working together. And when

183
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:54,994
we talk about people working together, they have their own

184
00:11:55,032 --> 00:12:00,946
ways of working based on the experience they learning

185
00:12:01,128 --> 00:12:04,706
from other companies and the agreements they have

186
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:08,854
inside the team, right? So it's so hard to not

187
00:12:08,972 --> 00:12:12,646
face out problems or to not find detractors in

188
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:15,714
an adopting process. And here in platform engineering,

189
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:19,990
adoption is the second possibility

190
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,114
of failure. And last but not least, people is

191
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:27,418
behind this, right? And today we have a huge problem

192
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:31,134
in it, which is the rotation of people, right. And how

193
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:34,554
to keep people aware, keep people motivated,

194
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:38,926
right? So this is another of the problems we

195
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:42,526
will probably face out. So the

196
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:45,986
first one is lack of time and high demand as I mentioned,

197
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:49,794
right, because it's a matter of time

198
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:53,746
we need to deliver. We have the challenge in

199
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:57,014
the marketplace. All companies are trying to win,

200
00:12:57,132 --> 00:13:00,678
right? So all time they are running, they want

201
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:03,990
to deliver new features, they want to be competitive.

202
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,926
So there is no time to

203
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:11,114
be asked to achieve their expertise in all

204
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:14,666
tools. Let's talk about the product team when they

205
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:18,762
are developing a new application or developing a new feature of our application

206
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:22,766
and they need to start using new architecture solutions or

207
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:26,090
they need to change how they are implementing their applications.

208
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,142
There is no time enough to be expert on how

209
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:34,142
we will deploy my API or how I will compile

210
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:38,190
and manage my secrets or integrate my secret management

211
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,346
tool with my cloud platform as

212
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:45,134
a service. So this lack of knowledge

213
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:48,874
at time will be generating tech depth

214
00:13:48,942 --> 00:13:55,270
for the team and at some time it will request

215
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,978
the price, right? And the other thing is

216
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:02,646
develop new skills. If they need to develop the skills

217
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:06,218
to work over the application, it's a core business for them.

218
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:11,070
They will not have the time for learn other

219
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,650
skills like how to manage the platform in production.

220
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,874
Right? This should be shared

221
00:14:18,922 --> 00:14:23,646
with other teams to focus on generate better skills

222
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:27,374
inside the team. Rely on failures and outages,

223
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:31,122
reply on failures and outages if a product

224
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:34,674
team needs to reply to their failures and outages in their

225
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:38,514
core business application, what will happen? If they need to reply

226
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:42,760
also to the platforms they use during the development and deployment process

227
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,830
and keep the documentation updated.

228
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,666
It's part of the development or the product team live to

229
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:54,394
document everything, but also if

230
00:14:54,432 --> 00:14:57,594
they need to document the platforms they are using will

231
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:01,134
increase more and more. The dependency and

232
00:15:01,172 --> 00:15:04,334
the depth they have in the time. So the

233
00:15:04,372 --> 00:15:07,966
demand is also a problem

234
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:12,160
because it will just increase. When you are doing the things good,

235
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,134
the demand will start to increase. So let's

236
00:15:17,262 --> 00:15:21,282
imagine that we have a platform team supporting these

237
00:15:21,336 --> 00:15:24,546
product teams that are developing applications and now they have

238
00:15:24,568 --> 00:15:28,374
a cognitive load reduced. But now more

239
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:30,806
and more teams will start to use the platform.

240
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:34,854
And also if we don't have a platform team, we have only

241
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,822
one team developing and now more teams

242
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:43,226
are appearing because we have new business cases and we

243
00:15:43,248 --> 00:15:46,778
need more applications. All them will try to use the same platform.

244
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:51,070
And this platform that start to be strategic

245
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,426
will start to be the point of failure,

246
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:57,534
because each team will try to do with

247
00:15:57,572 --> 00:16:01,226
their own ways of working and more users

248
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:04,866
will appear with more doubts, more requests, more problems,

249
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,434
right? That's the problem of demand and lack of

250
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:11,490
time behind platform engineering adoption.

251
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,038
And what about ways of working and thinking?

252
00:16:15,144 --> 00:16:18,950
It's very likely that you will encounter people

253
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,360
that are not agreeing with you,

254
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,710
right? Several times you will find

255
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,946
detractors because they want

256
00:16:29,968 --> 00:16:34,154
to do how they are doing, as always, right? Because they

257
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:37,258
know how to do. They understand that

258
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:40,182
like this way it will work, right?

259
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:43,194
And what about the compliance flows?

260
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:47,066
What about the processes that are defined

261
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,694
by the company and we need to follow?

262
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:53,870
Sometimes this will stop the innovation,

263
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,362
it will stop how we can make platform

264
00:16:57,496 --> 00:17:01,246
easily to be consumed by developers, by teams

265
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,478
that are behind the software delivery lifecycle.

266
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:08,866
And sometimes also we will see two specific requirements,

267
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,206
right? So specific at the level that you

268
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:17,862
will not be able to understand if this will be positive

269
00:17:17,926 --> 00:17:21,606
for the team or it's more a bottleneck

270
00:17:21,798 --> 00:17:26,554
to achieve the agreements and to achieve the

271
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:29,706
generation of the MVP or the solution to

272
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,760
achieve the market time.

273
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,986
Like some other problems related

274
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:40,910
to ways of working and thinking, what about teams that have different

275
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,242
priorities? Now I want to have my platform working here,

276
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:48,002
but the other team is thinking how I can building for these other

277
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:51,470
platforms and the language and understanding barriers.

278
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,290
Because sometimes companies are so big that they have teams

279
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,934
in different countries. I have suffered this in

280
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:02,322
some of the companies I worked for my luck,

281
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:05,990
I can speak different languages, but some teams in

282
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,270
specific countries, they don't have this luck.

283
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,746
And sometimes when they need to trade with other teams, it's difficult to

284
00:18:14,848 --> 00:18:19,206
remove this barrier and generate the shared understanding,

285
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,526
right? And last but not least,

286
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,046
keep the team engaged right? Behind everything,

287
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:29,742
behind technology, behind platforms, we have people,

288
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:34,210
people that can be influenced by their

289
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,986
situation, their ways of thinking with

290
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:42,114
clear cognitive limits, right. Without understanding if

291
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:45,986
they can code test, manage the CI

292
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:50,022
CD platform, manage the code quality platform and all

293
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:53,766
the rules behind it, the configurations with a

294
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:57,390
lot of market temptation and with a technical

295
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,018
and practice dev. Because we will not find

296
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:04,826
probably all seniors engineers we want

297
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:08,060
to have, right? Our market is

298
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,094
full of different engineers with different flavors and

299
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:16,000
it will depend a lot on how they can work together to improve this experience.

300
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,686
So what are the three practices I have prepared to

301
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:24,350
win and face out these roadstones

302
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,954
and be able to jump over them, right. The keys of

303
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:31,890
success I have prepared for you and I have implemented

304
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,050
in some of the teams I have worked with good

305
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,966
results. The first thing is customer

306
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:44,646
centric leadership as I mentioned it, and you will

307
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:48,140
be able to see in the videos and talks I share with you.

308
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,574
Platform engineering generates a clear vision

309
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:57,450
of an internal customer. So this platform

310
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,150
team, they will need to focus and have very clear

311
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,718
and identify this customer. What is

312
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,734
basically the product teams or depending on the platform you are

313
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:12,286
working right or you are building. So the proximity to

314
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:15,762
these teams is very important for product teams and

315
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:20,062
this leader that is guiding the team should promote

316
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:23,534
continuously this proximity,

317
00:20:23,662 --> 00:20:27,462
this vision of customer, internal customer

318
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:30,498
and guiding the team based on objectives,

319
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:34,386
goals that will generate the clear understanding

320
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:37,974
of priority. What is the needs, the real needs of my

321
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:41,258
customer? Generating a platform that will work for them,

322
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:44,826
not for the rest of the companies in the market. We need

323
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:48,778
to focus on the real needs of our internal customer

324
00:20:48,944 --> 00:20:52,778
because sometimes this company has their own policies,

325
00:20:52,874 --> 00:20:57,070
their own ways of work and the platform should

326
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,134
work for them without reducing all the cognitive load of

327
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,482
this platform. Of these product teams that will use the platform

328
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:08,130
to start using this should be smooth at the level

329
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,194
that they will just onboard the application and start coding and

330
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:15,842
focusing on their core business. So this leadership with

331
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:18,420
customer centric vision is clear,

332
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,534
is key for success to remove all the

333
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,534
problems behind the time and demand because

334
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,118
he will be able to decide what the platform

335
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:33,754
team should be doing and what they should be

336
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,450
focusing in the moment based on the real needs of the

337
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,742
customers. One other thing we have here is

338
00:21:41,876 --> 00:21:45,726
practice what you preach, right? If you are building a

339
00:21:45,748 --> 00:21:49,146
platform team and this platform team is creating

340
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:52,398
tool, is preparing tools and ways of working,

341
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:56,046
try to generate metrics, metrics to measure how teams

342
00:21:56,078 --> 00:22:00,290
are using these platforms and these ways of working, but also

343
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,122
use these metrics to measure platform team,

344
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:06,406
right. How they are using this platform. To not

345
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:10,054
only say hey man, use my platform but

346
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:13,910
I'm not using it. I don't know how it works because from real

347
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,426
life, the platform team will understand

348
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:21,574
how the platform itself should work, how the flow

349
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:25,850
should be, because they will leave it from their

350
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,220
experience, removing the dependency of

351
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,054
ways of working on how people think, because they will live

352
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:38,334
in their own life, their own day to day,

353
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:42,222
how to use these tools and to measure, same way as product

354
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:45,682
teams should be measuring the platform and

355
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:49,746
also will help them to keep engaged, right, because they should

356
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,794
be using the tool as they are promoting to be used. The other

357
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,974
practice is form champions. We cannot have the

358
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:01,254
expertise, the specific knowledge in all tools we are

359
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:05,446
promoting in a platform that

360
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:08,650
we are offering as a service. Because a platform inside

361
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,078
a company is a toolbox. It's a group of tools interconnected

362
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:16,746
and prepared to be used in an

363
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:20,430
easy way inside this specific company. I'm talking about

364
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,206
platforms, not only the

365
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:27,150
technology itself, but also the infrastructure.

366
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,858
This platform team will need to work on documentation,

367
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:35,314
configuration, solve bugs, a lot of the things. So the

368
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:38,738
general knowledge is a

369
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:41,842
must for all of them. We are talking about t shaped people,

370
00:23:41,896 --> 00:23:45,794
right? T shaped group of people. But to

371
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:49,954
form this deep knowledge, they should not go

372
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:53,666
through all platforms they have in the tool chain.

373
00:23:53,778 --> 00:23:57,446
But instead of that, you should have

374
00:23:57,548 --> 00:24:01,354
champions for each technology. Obviously they should have an

375
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:04,454
understanding, the whole team should have an understanding,

376
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:07,866
a shared understanding. And this will be the responsibility of

377
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:11,518
the champions also to reduce the cognitive load of

378
00:24:11,604 --> 00:24:15,166
the leader of the platform team, guiding the rest of

379
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:18,702
the team to work over the specific platforms. They have the

380
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:22,286
expertise. In summary, we have

381
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:25,726
these three practices, right? The customer centric leadership.

382
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:29,346
They need to have a clear image of the customer. I mean the

383
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,202
platform team. They need to understand that they have these

384
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:36,726
product teams inside the company and they need to

385
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:40,742
provide the platform for them based on their real

386
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:45,062
needs. So the targeted objectives need to be clear also

387
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:48,038
and promote the closeness with the customer.

388
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:51,674
So this leadership will be one of the keys of success.

389
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:55,642
And if you have decided who is the best

390
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:59,354
leader for your team, for sure you will have one part

391
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:03,486
of your path with a

392
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:07,200
real high probability to have success.

393
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,350
But the importance of the customer centric vision for this leader

394
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,794
is critical. The second practices is practice

395
00:25:16,842 --> 00:25:20,062
what you preach. If you have one platform,

396
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:23,902
understand, define what is the metrics to measure people using

397
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:27,250
this platform and use these metrics to measure

398
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,854
the platform team also and force them to use the

399
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:34,866
platform to build the platform right and recognize

400
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:38,746
and show achievements. What is better to show what a platform

401
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:43,020
is generating benefits. If you can show from your experience

402
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,998
here, you can come with DevOps practices

403
00:25:47,094 --> 00:25:52,014
like the showcases and demo days well

404
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:55,470
come from agile world also. But to show from

405
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,214
the team, the platform team, how platform should be used

406
00:25:59,332 --> 00:26:03,054
from the experience, the real experience. And last but not

407
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:06,738
least, this practice is very important. I have been using in all companies

408
00:26:06,824 --> 00:26:10,178
I have worked is farm champions because one person

409
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:14,222
cannot have all the knowledge, deeply knowledge

410
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:18,150
and all platforms, all technologies we are working, right?

411
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,960
So form experts by tool and

412
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,182
delegate to them that they should lead

413
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:29,882
that specific tool as part of the group,

414
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,194
they should promoting which kind of trainings the rest

415
00:26:33,232 --> 00:26:36,906
of the team should be doing, how to structure the

416
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:40,634
documentation, how to implement a configuration. They should

417
00:26:40,752 --> 00:26:44,494
be this lead because the lead of a platform team will not

418
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:48,062
have enough time just to be expert on

419
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:52,410
all tools. They will be managed, right. And trust on them.

420
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,398
The champions should be people that are fully encouraged

421
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:59,874
to work as a champion inside the team. So they

422
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:03,394
should be these heroes of each tool,

423
00:27:03,512 --> 00:27:07,654
but not behind unicorns inside the team,

424
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:11,890
right? We don't want to generate people that cannot be replaced

425
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,754
or people that cannot

426
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:21,500
have a background backup, right? So these

427
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,942
champions should be training and sharing the knowledge

428
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:29,062
they have with the rest of the team to fill the gaps,

429
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:32,814
right? And the leader should be promoting and delegating this

430
00:27:32,852 --> 00:27:36,762
vision and deciding who will be the experts

431
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:40,814
of each tool. This is another of the

432
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:44,386
real good practices I have implemented and have worked for

433
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:47,986
me. So just to finalize, if you want to go

434
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:52,482
even more deep on these

435
00:27:52,536 --> 00:27:55,830
three practices, I have been implemented also.

436
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,350
Nick Watt that talk

437
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,574
in the platform Engineering conference in 2022

438
00:28:03,692 --> 00:28:07,078
talked about people, processes and platform a community

439
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:11,062
focused approach. This talk will reinforce

440
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:13,978
you the three practices I'm showing you today,

441
00:28:14,144 --> 00:28:17,546
and you will be able to find much more of

442
00:28:17,648 --> 00:28:21,450
platform engineering, the YouTube channel and

443
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,630
also in the platform engineering webpage,

444
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:28,586
platformengineering.org. I would invite

445
00:28:28,618 --> 00:28:33,018
you to get involved in this movement and

446
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:36,354
share your experiences and your

447
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:40,462
keys of success, your practices to reduce

448
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:44,546
the failures in the past. Because as

449
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:48,054
idea platform engineering have helped a lot of

450
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:51,794
companies to go through their challenges and achieve

451
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:55,254
the metrics and results they have

452
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:58,200
been expecting. So thank you for your time.

453
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,974
