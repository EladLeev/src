1
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,494
Hey everyone, I'm Ivan and today I'm going

2
00:00:20,532 --> 00:00:24,110
to tell you how to kickstart your IELTS career.

3
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,610
I'm working as iOS software engineer

4
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,914
for the last seven years and heading

5
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:36,642
back. I could give you some advices

6
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:40,380
that could improve your

7
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:44,730
way along this trip.

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,780
So basically,

9
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,638
all of this coming to base

10
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:57,310
roadmap with three simple stages

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,350
with one huge theme

12
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:06,260
behind them, which we will cover later.

13
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,300
So the first step is of course it says education.

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,800
And when we're talking about education,

15
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,274
I was working as a teacher and professional instructor

16
00:01:20,322 --> 00:01:23,586
for iOS courses alone,

17
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:27,720
six years or something like that. So basically,

18
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,050
first thing you should know that anyone could

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,746
code and you

20
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:42,046
should just find out if it belongs to you or

21
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:45,790
not. So just give it a shot.

22
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,630
If you feel like it's yours,

23
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,702
continue working on it. Select some basic

24
00:01:56,766 --> 00:02:00,494
courses that don't

25
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:04,370
have any prerequirements, so you could

26
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,710
start as completely beginner and carefully

27
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,310
read them lesson by lesson,

28
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,350
finish assignment by assignment.

29
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,714
Just be patient and it

30
00:02:20,752 --> 00:02:21,980
will work for you.

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,810
So depending on course,

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,638
you could learn basics or whole stuff

33
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:34,800
at the same time. I prefer to have them

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,200
in small chunks, so it's better to

35
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,370
break down things to

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,450
just give information with small portions.

37
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,166
But anyway, after you get the basics

38
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:56,310
you could learn the object oriented programming.

39
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,994
Also combine it with user

40
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:04,582
interface. Doesn't matter, it will be

41
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:09,094
Swiftui or just regular interface

42
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,220
builder things.

43
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,090
After this you could get patterns,

44
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,574
some kind of delegation,

45
00:03:19,702 --> 00:03:24,202
or something more general like MVVM,

46
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:25,710
MVC MVP.

47
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,218
So as

48
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:35,922
the finish of this education process,

49
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:39,762
you should have basically three

50
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:43,234
things that you will

51
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:46,658
learn. So first and most important thing,

52
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:51,142
iOS, you should know how to learn things out

53
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:56,834
of those things that you already learned.

54
00:03:56,962 --> 00:04:00,140
So basically if you know how to make,

55
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,142
I don't know, simple loop that iterate

56
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:10,926
through collection, you should get how

57
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:14,814
to iterate through multidimensional collection or

58
00:04:14,852 --> 00:04:18,366
something like that. So basically you

59
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:22,506
should know how

60
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:25,858
to use those building

61
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:29,330
blocks to build more complex programs.

62
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,958
You should know how to Google things,

63
00:04:35,064 --> 00:04:38,626
how to apply solutions

64
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,720
from stack overflow to your code to make it work.

65
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,682
And yeah, that's the most important skill

66
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:47,830
of the programmers.

67
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,486
Basically you need to know how to solve

68
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:54,300
the problems by yourself.

69
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,206
The second thing I think you should come

70
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:04,286
up with after your education process, it's your

71
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:07,806
GitHub profile. So it

72
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:11,018
will be nice to see your GitHub profile.

73
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:14,290
If I will hire you as a junior developer

74
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,974
just to see the dynamics

75
00:05:19,022 --> 00:05:24,210
of your study with some kind of demo

76
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,494
projects or something like that, it will be

77
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:31,480
also very cool. And the third part,

78
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,574
which is absolutely optional, but it will be a

79
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:41,370
large benefit in your resume

80
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,954
if you've done some application and put it to App

81
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:47,580
Store.

82
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,166
Yeah, that's really matter. So it

83
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:56,218
will be really nice to have it on your resume.

84
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,400
Some link to your GitHub and

85
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,380
link to your app on the App Store.

86
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,586
So basically this is it about

87
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,058
education. And after that

88
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:14,718
we could switch to the next step,

89
00:06:14,904 --> 00:06:19,074
which is first job. So after you've

90
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:23,670
done your resume with links to GitHub

91
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,480
and your app,

92
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,514
you could search for vacancies on

93
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:37,740
the jobs job sites and

94
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,682
get all the technical

95
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:48,206
requirements out of them to

96
00:06:48,228 --> 00:06:52,080
the list and just go

97
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,810
through this list and find the blind spots,

98
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,290
work on them, improve yourself on

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,482
tech side. You don't have

100
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:08,200
to know everything about for example

101
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,094
foundation and UI kit, it just means that

102
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:16,440
you have to know the general things.

103
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,294
I don't know, maybe it's

104
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:26,620
like ras dictionaries, how they work,

105
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:30,894
objects versus structures, what is

106
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:37,600
swift and so on. So basically

107
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,690
after you get your tech prep,

108
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,238
you could apply for these positions

109
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:54,514
and go to interview. So for

110
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:58,630
example, you get to interview,

111
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,000
you've done the first step which is

112
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,378
recruiting and

113
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:13,510
then you get to technical

114
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,114
part of the interview. So the main

115
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:20,382
thing you should learn

116
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:24,480
about and the main tip that I will give you

117
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,942
on this step, it's just record your

118
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:32,754
interview to get back to

119
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:36,820
any question at any time. So basically,

120
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,514
even if you fall this interview and it

121
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:46,600
wasn't great for you, you could just

122
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:53,654
get back to this recording and try

123
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:57,560
to improve yourself based on what you did before.

124
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,450
Of course ask for feedback. So maybe engineers

125
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,074
or interviewer will give

126
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:12,478
you the feedback and find

127
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:16,414
out your weak spots as well. But if

128
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:20,158
you record your interview, it will be really nice to

129
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:24,210
have this record for your own purposes.

130
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,180
When, when.

131
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,494
So when company asks you about,

132
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:39,094
do you have any questions about company, it's really

133
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:43,814
important to ask about what

134
00:09:43,852 --> 00:09:48,140
team you apply for, what will be the team.

135
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,060
So you could also,

136
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,934
in some cases you could also talk

137
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:07,054
to team members, find out is

138
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:11,562
it a good fitment

139
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:15,250
with you? And yeah,

140
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,334
it's really important to have a good supervisor.

141
00:10:18,462 --> 00:10:22,530
So basically it's your first job, you will spend something

142
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,782
like half of

143
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:29,414
year or year or maybe two years in there.

144
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:33,506
So if you get good supervisor,

145
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:38,310
it means that your learning curve will be dramatically

146
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,474
increased and you

147
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:46,410
get a lot of new stuff out of them. It's much better

148
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,022
than work as a single

149
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:54,014
developer on your first job. Believe me,

150
00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:58,334
it wasn't good experience for me. So yeah,

151
00:10:58,452 --> 00:11:02,382
just look for some opportunities with good team

152
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:06,130
and good supervisor. After that you could

153
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,130
accept the offer. Don't accept the first offer you get

154
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,700
because you always could

155
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,414
say that I need one more week or something like

156
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:21,334
that to

157
00:11:21,372 --> 00:11:25,158
wait for another offer and just compare them and then

158
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:27,670
just make your decision.

159
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,026
So as

160
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:37,820
a conclusion on the first job,

161
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,000
you should get the most of it.

162
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,390
So basically just find the right spot,

163
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,760
find the best,

164
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,380
find something that works best for you.

165
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,914
So the next step is

166
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:10,438
building career. So basically it

167
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:14,454
just breaks down to two by

168
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:18,202
two blocks when the

169
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:21,946
time when I should step up or ask for

170
00:12:21,968 --> 00:12:25,018
a raise or change company.

171
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:28,762
And what's the

172
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:32,846
red flags around all this stuff that

173
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:36,160
I have on current company. For example,

174
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,010
for example, if you see that your skills

175
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,522
doesn't improved for the last two

176
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:50,478
years is definitely the red flag.

177
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:54,354
So maybe it's time to change the team or change the

178
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:57,702
company. If you don't have

179
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:02,934
any challenges and you

180
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:09,242
just sit down and make

181
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:12,518
down all the tasks like routine,

182
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:16,780
it also could be a red flag. So you don't have

183
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,470
any kind of progress,

184
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,846
you're just doing your things. So basically if

185
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:32,962
you feel like that, just ask

186
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:36,306
about changing the team, find out

187
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:39,300
what works best for you.

188
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,842
But in my case, the best

189
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:47,574
opportunities comes up when I go to

190
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,320
interview to other companies,

191
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,510
something like every six months, you could

192
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,186
just go to interview, check out your

193
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:05,414
skills, find out what's

194
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,380
the purposes of other companies,

195
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,360
what's their propose and yeah,

196
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,214
that will be a great experience as well.

197
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:21,162
So maybe everything was changed

198
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:24,834
around for the last

199
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:25,700
two years,

200
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,740
but from my experience, every time,

201
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,390
every time I go to some interviews I learn something

202
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,080
new.

203
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,442
Even if you don't want to change your

204
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:51,660
current job, if you have some offers on hand,

205
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,674
it will be good reason to get some

206
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,940
raise and so on.

207
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,662
So all of these steps are

208
00:15:03,716 --> 00:15:07,998
important, but most important thing here

209
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:11,600
and it's going behind all of the things

210
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,926
is of course it's networking. So networking

211
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:21,314
is major thing that

212
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:22,930
you should pay attention.

213
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,950
A lot of my career solutions

214
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,862
or decisions were made because

215
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,660
of people around me.

216
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,606
So basically it's

217
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:49,974
like when you go into some place to

218
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:54,190
some hackathons or just conferences,

219
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,230
meetups or something like this, you have cool opportunity

220
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,080
to make some connections with people.

221
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,610
And who knows, maybe those people will

222
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,498
change your life or just

223
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:13,620
will become good friends,

224
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,860
give some advice to you or something like that.

225
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:22,406
Basically it's a huge part of all of these things

226
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:26,022
that going on. So yeah,

227
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:32,522
build your network. It's really important after

228
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:36,122
all. As a summary, I would like

229
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:40,314
to say that don't

230
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:44,000
hesitate to spend more time on education process.

231
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,920
So for some of my students that was

232
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,518
from like two months or three months,

233
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:57,460
they become a developers. Other guys

234
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,620
finish their projects in one year or so.

235
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,280
So basically it doesn't matter how much time you will spend,

236
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:10,134
it's matter of quality

237
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:14,054
of your education. So just be

238
00:17:14,092 --> 00:17:18,170
sure that you get all the topics and

239
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,140
invest in your education.

240
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,722
Be careful with your first job. So I

241
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:31,790
don't recommend you to be as a solo developer.

242
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,400
It's better to find a team that will grow you up.

243
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:42,410
Be open for the challenges. So if you feel

244
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,860
like this is the challenge for me,

245
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,526
so 100% it's

246
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,242
the right spot for you. So after you best this

247
00:17:54,296 --> 00:17:57,694
challenge, you will feel that your skill

248
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:01,046
is grow and you

249
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:05,080
can move on and do more

250
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,806
with this experience. Of course communication is

251
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:14,374
a key to everything because all this

252
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:18,006
it thing is not only about

253
00:18:18,188 --> 00:18:21,790
software, it, it's more about

254
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,666
people who you work with. So basically communicate

255
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:30,042
to people, build your connections, build your network,

256
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:34,094
it's really important. And stay

257
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:38,058
tuned and enjoy your developers journey.

258
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:39,422
Have a nice day.
