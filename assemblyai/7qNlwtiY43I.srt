00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,834
Hi everyone, thanks for joining us. Today I'm going to talk about building secure

2
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:48,390
architecture in the cloud. It's like the talk of the town wherein people

3
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,886
who have never thought of moving to cloud are talking about moving to

4
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:55,486
cloud. Now this is a situation happening because of the pandemic that we

5
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:59,354
are in, so why not talk about it? That how can we secure

6
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:02,894
the architecture in the cloud when it's the need of the hour? And it's not

7
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:06,594
just that the bigger organizations have to make sure that they

8
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:11,250
are secure, it goes for the startups as well. So today

9
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,866
I'm going to give you a brief architecture or the

10
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:18,438
knowledge that I have around building secure architecture in the cloud.

11
00:01:18,604 --> 00:01:21,878
So while we deep dive into it, let me talk a bit about myself.

12
00:01:21,964 --> 00:01:26,262
IBM, Vandana Verma Segur. My day job is with one of the multinational companies

13
00:01:26,396 --> 00:01:29,926
where I am working as a product security architect. Apart from that,

14
00:01:29,948 --> 00:01:33,222
I root role owner work wherein I support OwAs,

15
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:36,586
which is open web application security project. I'm one of the global board

16
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:40,698
of director for OwAs and I also work a lot

17
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:44,502
bringing diversity and information security, which doesn't

18
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:47,726
only need to be come, it can be anyone who wants to be part of

19
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:51,278
cybersecurity. It can be from different domains, it can be the person who's going

20
00:01:51,284 --> 00:01:54,818
to be flipping domain from any other to information security.

21
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:58,258
So that's what I do during my free time.

22
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:01,966
I love thinking about topics that I know or I love researching

23
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:05,394
about new things in cybersecurity. Today's agenda is

24
00:02:05,432 --> 00:02:09,406
more around cloud strategy. Why do we need to have an architecture

25
00:02:09,438 --> 00:02:13,174
review for cloud when we are thinking about moving to cloud, or even if

26
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:16,646
we have already moved to cloud, what are the things that we need to consider?

27
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:20,614
At the same time, what are the scenarios that are stopping us from moving

28
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:23,802
to the cloud or when we have already tough, okay,

29
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:27,402
now this is the way to go. What are the considerations that we should have?

30
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,498
And then we will sum up all of that. So when I talk about

31
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:35,358
public cloud and the data that is moving to cloud,

32
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:38,894
that's a huge number and has per one of the research which

33
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:42,858
is latest, that 90% of the data and analytics

34
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,338
would be there in public cloud by 2022. And at

35
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:50,562
the same time when we are in pandemic, there are over 98%

36
00:02:50,616 --> 00:02:54,418
people, 98% organizations which have moved to cloud.

37
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:57,762
That's one of the status. And some people were

38
00:02:57,816 --> 00:03:01,014
planning to move to the cloud, but this situation has made us

39
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:04,966
so that we have taken the steps to move to the cloud. At the

40
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,870
same time, when I talk about the services that are part of the cloud,

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,866
solutions or public cloud. The services market is expected

42
00:03:12,898 --> 00:03:16,422
to reach its new number, which is 354 billion

43
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:20,410
dollars, which is huge number. And 83%

44
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,870
of the enterprises workloads will be in cloud by

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,614
2020. That was the saying. But now when

46
00:03:27,652 --> 00:03:31,326
we are in pandemic, that situation has reached another peak point.

47
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:34,714
Apart from that, 66% of the enterprises

48
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:38,274
already have a central cloud team or a cloud

49
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:41,394
center for excellence. They've started to things about it.

50
00:03:41,432 --> 00:03:45,154
They want to have something that can maintain. They wanted to have a team which

51
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:49,010
can maintain the cloud. Now when we are talking about this numbers wherein

52
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,094
the organizations are spending so much on the cloud, talking about moving

53
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,062
to cloud, or have moved to the cloud and reaching its own big number

54
00:03:57,196 --> 00:04:00,214
organisations are moving to the cloud,

55
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:03,450
sometimes the situation says, okay, you have a plan,

56
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,474
you're going to go to the cloud by this date. But now when we are

57
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:10,858
in a kind of a situation wherein we are dealing with a pandemic, organizations have

58
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:14,654
already fast forwarded their move to the cloud and more than 1.3

59
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:18,314
trillion it spending will be affected by this shift.

60
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:22,618
And always when we talk about these numbers, cloud adoption,

61
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:26,858
spending on the cloud, it has positive as well as negative impact.

62
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:30,626
There are organizations who have a view that, okay, this is what they want

63
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:34,066
in the cloud, but at the same time, there are organisations who have

64
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:37,410
a plan to move to cloud, but they don't know whether cloud is

65
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,886
the best solution or which cloud is the best solution for them. So these

66
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:44,278
are some numbers which are going to spill the beans and change the numbers

67
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:47,666
in the coming future. If I talk about why organizations

68
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:51,734
have concerns in moving to the cloud, or when a small startup

69
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:55,386
thinks that they're going to move to the cloud, but they are facing some

70
00:04:55,408 --> 00:04:59,494
challenges. If I highlight some, it's because of the unknown territory

71
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:03,310
that everything is moving out of the organizations. And since

72
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,606
ages, all the data were always in the

73
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:10,138
data centers. But now when we are moving, the scenario

74
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:13,714
or the paradigm is shifting, cybersecurities are becoming day to day

75
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:17,854
struggle for businesses. Recent trends in cybersecurity statistics reveal

76
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:22,206
a huge increase in the cybersecurity space, like the organisations

77
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,794
getting hacked, data breaches. And not

78
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:28,722
just that. Now when we are living in the world of IoT,

79
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,742
Internet, connected devices, mobiles, there's another shift which is happening.

80
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:36,322
There's so much of concern around the data breach.

81
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:40,282
Additionally, recent security research suggests that most companies

82
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:44,570
have unprotected data poor cybersecurity practices in place.

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,006
There are teams who are working towards securing in organizations

84
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:51,354
where there's so much data still lying out there and there

85
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,750
are still vulnerable services on which

86
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,238
if we talk about touching, that takes a huge amount of time to

87
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:01,818
patch a vulnerability. If it exists, especially if it's an internal vulnerability,

88
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:05,454
people take time to resolve that. Another shift

89
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:08,946
that I've heard that people are moving their legacy applications to

90
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:13,090
containers or to cloud. But think about legacy applications already

91
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,834
have an overhead. Why do we need to move them to docker or

92
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:20,806
containers if we don't have a proper plan? They will still be an overhead if

93
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:24,882
we don't properly update it. Lifting and shifting never, always helps.

94
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:28,166
And when it comes to the legacy applications, that's what have been

95
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,910
the strategy for a lot of organizations. So we need to address

96
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,010
that concern as well, wherein if there is an application which is legacy application,

97
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,306
and we are trying to go ahead and move that to the cloud, we need

98
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:42,714
to make some changes so that it can be cloud ready. It shouldn't be just,

99
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:45,806
we are going to pick it up and post it there. It should not be

100
00:06:45,828 --> 00:06:48,874
the copy and paste. There will be lot of overhead.

101
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:52,266
And not just that, there will be lot of budgeting constraints

102
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:55,662
that will come into picture, because to manage that

103
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:59,618
in the cloud, we would need resources and whatnot, and whether the application

104
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:02,770
will get the required kind of support would be there or not.

105
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,546
Who knows about that. Another concern is the hybrid cloud kind

106
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:09,090
of an environment or multicloud kind of an environment.

107
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:13,554
Organizations think that do we need a multicloud strategy,

108
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:16,790
hybrid cloud strategy, what kind of things that we are looking for?

109
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,246
So that's, again another kind of a scenario which needs to

110
00:07:20,268 --> 00:07:23,586
be addressed. Because if we don't understand that vendor

111
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:27,002
lock in could be there, if one cloud doesn't suits us,

112
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:31,050
we can move to another cloud. So that's a very big area to address.

113
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,954
At the same time, regulatory concerns. There are so many regulations

114
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:38,746
that we have to follow, especially if in us, we talk about CCPA,

115
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:42,414
if it's California, if it's a european, then we have to talk about

116
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:45,546
GDPR. And then there are so many other compliance certifications

117
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:49,342
that are there, or requirements which are there, which needs to be addressed.

118
00:07:49,406 --> 00:07:53,666
There are standards that needs to be adhered to. There's a governance mechanism that

119
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:57,394
we need. How are we going to attain that? That's a really

120
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:01,186
big area to be addressed. Now let's look at if we don't

121
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:04,822
have a right kind of architecture in the cloud, what could go wrong?

122
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:09,074
Managing data on the cloud is a function, actually a task

123
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:12,074
that is co owned and co managed by the cloud. Customer,

124
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,754
which could be us or could be an organisations and the cloud

125
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:19,722
service provider which is CSP. So it's a shared responsibility and

126
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:23,526
this adds up to efficiency and cost optimization at the same

127
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:27,422
time. But there are still few gray areas that we need to address and look

128
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:30,734
after. So as the saying goes, the chain is

129
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:34,558
only as strong as its weakest link, while a regular pen test

130
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:37,986
activity offers a certain level of assurance that yes,

131
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:41,646
we are safeguarded from the threat actors and our infrastructure is secure.

132
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:45,150
However, it may not go into the details of overall architecture

133
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,806
design and if we don't do the right architecture design, we could be in

134
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,534
trouble. So a secure review of architecture is very,

135
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:56,818
very important. It look at what's there in the internal network

136
00:08:56,914 --> 00:09:00,666
and what are the nuts and bolts of a network. We also

137
00:09:00,768 --> 00:09:04,902
need to have the information around our architecture.

138
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:08,886
We need to do some exercises to get to know our own network.

139
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:13,202
If we do not know, which is like security misconfiguration

140
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:17,546
or we have left a bucket open for anyone and everyone to see, the database

141
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:21,006
credentials are there in the code which is publicly available even when

142
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:24,418
you change it. The thing that is there on the code on public

143
00:09:24,504 --> 00:09:28,114
that will be cached forever. And the code of public or

144
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:31,874
cloud Secure architecture review is to identify and highlight those

145
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:35,410
cloud security weaknesses and strengths and provide the

146
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,426
right guidance towards making a mature security

147
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:43,538
architect structure. Now with an increasing number of organisations

148
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:47,718
which are moving towards agile and DevOps methodologies and running

149
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:51,734
their infrastructure in the cloud, and they are trying to attain

150
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:55,130
the whole product itself, their organisations is based

151
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,682
out of the cloud. So it's really, really important to secure that

152
00:09:58,736 --> 00:10:02,574
the attack surface has actually widened for them, and not

153
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:05,854
just for them, but overall it is widened and it's very,

154
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:10,000
very difficult to sometimes understand that what's our own

155
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,366
play area or what's our own environment now there has

156
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:18,274
been moving parts in that also wherein we are deploying changes into

157
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:22,322
the production itself directly. I have seen organisations deploying changes

158
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:25,906
to production, who does that? It's like the most unsafe thing to do,

159
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:29,894
that you're just putting an x on your own feet. So identifying the

160
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:33,734
attack surface and evaluating our own environment is the

161
00:10:33,772 --> 00:10:37,286
first and foremost thing. And if we don't understand and

162
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:41,306
address these challenges, we're going to be in big, big trouble. So do

163
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:45,034
we need an architecture review? Think about it. Obviously we do

164
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:48,826
need it, because we have seen that there have been increase in the

165
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,486
cybercrimes and breaches and every other day we see that were

166
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:56,122
is an organization getting attacked or hacked or breached.

167
00:10:56,186 --> 00:10:59,262
Now when that happens, as per one of the study,

168
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:02,158
when an organization gets breached. That doesn't happen for one,

169
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:06,114
like, that doesn't happen once. It happens a couple of times in

170
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:09,602
a short span. Now, the organization know that we have been

171
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:12,930
compromised, and still the same continues to happen,

172
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,566
because it's not that the organization don't safeguard them,

173
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:19,970
it's because sometimes we don't understand our own attack surface.

174
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:23,282
So it's very important to understand what's our protect surface,

175
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:27,090
which is like our own data network

176
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,694
assets or applications, or even our users. So it's

177
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:34,246
very important to understand these aspects. So if they don't

178
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,446
understand, what would be the impact. So the risk

179
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:41,434
of breaches can be huge. It can be that

180
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:45,638
organization could have penalties, which is due to regulatories,

181
00:11:45,734 --> 00:11:49,422
like they've seen so many penalties due to GDPR or

182
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:52,878
customer data loss. This is like losing the customer

183
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:56,642
data and then losing the customer. So we can have a big problem,

184
00:11:56,776 --> 00:12:00,146
and then the reputation, which is one of the most important thing

185
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:04,146
in brand value. Another thing would be once we lose one customer,

186
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:07,426
we tend to lose multiple at the same time. And when we talk about the

187
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:11,046
statistics that go a long way. So security breaches have

188
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:15,734
increased in huge number, I would say by 11% since 2018 and

189
00:12:15,772 --> 00:12:19,354
67% since 2014. There's a huge number

190
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:23,558
or huge increase. Hackers attack every 39 seconds

191
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:27,594
on an average. Wow, that's gross. So the average time

192
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:30,810
to identify a breach in 2019 was

193
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,122
206 days. God, if an organization

194
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:37,690
figure out that much of time, that, yes, they have been compromised.

195
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,498
It's a big problem. So all these data have collected from the Ponymon

196
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:45,674
research done by IBM in partnership with the IBM.

197
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:49,346
So you can look at the report done in 2020 that has the

198
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,946
latest data about what could be the impact of

199
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:56,574
all these breaches that are happening now. When we talk about migration

200
00:12:56,622 --> 00:13:00,210
to the cloud, that's actually a fear of unknown.

201
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,470
And cloud brings the Internet benefits and it brings the breaches also

202
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,038
at the same time. So building on top of the native security

203
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:11,190
of the cloud, which is there, will help us big time.

204
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,618
Sometimes we don't understand that, yes, this is there in the cloud and we can

205
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:17,594
take help from. I have seen it. So it's very,

206
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:21,158
very important to understand what our cloud security provider, which is providing.

207
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:24,574
So there are still so many questions that

208
00:13:24,612 --> 00:13:28,654
are unanswered, or there are gray areas which are lingering around and which

209
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:31,790
lead to these exposures and breaches that happen.

210
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,146
Now, what are these? If I talk about these

211
00:13:35,188 --> 00:13:38,638
questions, how my data look in terms of format,

212
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,274
state flow, and more when we talk about on premise and

213
00:13:42,312 --> 00:13:45,394
cloud. But what do we need to understand? Like, how are we going to

214
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:48,486
safeguard my data when we talk about moving from on

215
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:51,942
premise to the cloud, what level of access do the

216
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:55,714
cloud security provider employees get to the data when I host

217
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:59,346
on the cloud, like whether they're going to access my data, and if I host

218
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:02,426
it on the cloud, that means they have access to anything and everything. So are

219
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:05,898
they segregating it or not? At the same time, if I talk

220
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:09,530
about cloud security providers native security features, which are great,

221
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,246
I've seen with so many vendors, there are great features, but how do

222
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:17,022
I know how much of them have been exercised or thought through,

223
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:20,606
or whether they are even effective? And how do I get that there

224
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:24,714
is an assurance? Yes, there are regulatory requirements

225
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:28,034
my cloud provider have met and there are auditors who have

226
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:31,426
come and measured that. So it's very important for me to understand. And how do

227
00:14:31,448 --> 00:14:34,574
I get notified if there is a breach with that cloud provider,

228
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:37,234
or even if were is a breach attempt also?

229
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:41,174
So that's really, really a concerning area. And if I

230
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:44,534
talk about the research by Gartner. And Gartner predicts that

231
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:48,726
by 2023, the lead cloud service provider will have a distributive

232
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:53,126
ATM environment which have the presence to serve

233
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:57,734
many services and apprehensions to not take a backseat.

234
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:01,594
So all these things will be considered. Now,

235
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:05,710
if I talk about how should we do the architecture review?

236
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,200
Now, I have talked a lot about breaches. I've talked about

237
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,714
this could be the impact, but did I talk about architecture,

238
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:16,702
which is like, talk is all about. So now we're going to talk about architecture.

239
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:20,146
What are the lessons that we should be learning from that?

240
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:23,906
So first, and the foremost thing is that it's all about aligning the

241
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:28,146
fact that there are risks, understanding that there are risks when

242
00:15:28,168 --> 00:15:30,902
we are moving to the cloud, the first thing that we have to understand that

243
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:34,662
our network is hostile, completely hostile, before even moving

244
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:38,294
to the cloud. So we start that, yes, now we have to secure our

245
00:15:38,332 --> 00:15:42,098
environment, and that's where the first step lies. And when we

246
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:45,466
are there, we need to assess the risk and we have to have a proper

247
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:49,066
plan that how are we going to secure our own network. At the

248
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:52,558
same time, there are responsibility models that we are going to

249
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:56,506
be talking about. We need to understand them. That, yes, it's a shared

250
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,538
responsibility of a client and cloud service provider.

251
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:04,478
So it's a shared responsibility. I cannot say that I have hosted my data on

252
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:07,906
the cloud and I am all secure. No cloud security provider has

253
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:11,058
given you a platform, he has given you infrastructure, or he has given you the

254
00:16:11,064 --> 00:16:14,386
software, or they've given you that, but your data is on your

255
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,810
own responsibility. I can't say that. I have a house

256
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,206
and I have my tenants, and my tenants are going to take care of my

257
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:24,582
full house. No, that's not going to be there. You have to manage your own

258
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:28,022
house. Tenants will be there. If something goes wrong, they're going to call you,

259
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,706
they're not the offers. So it's like that when we are moving to

260
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:35,478
cloud, it's like we are moving to a house which is we have rented.

261
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:39,626
So we need to understand the whole clauses which

262
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:43,346
are there in the agreement. It's very, very important to get the lawyers

263
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:47,326
and the people who understand the language, or the auditors who understand the

264
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:50,526
language. Yes. This is what this cloud provider is abiding by.

265
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:54,366
And these are the things that needed to be

266
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,934
considered while moving to the cloud. Now let me show you an architecture.

267
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:02,270
This is an IBM cloud architecture. And if I talk about AWS

268
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,922
or Azure, most of the clouds almost look similar,

269
00:17:06,056 --> 00:17:09,762
wherein we have to address the concerns which are there as part of governance,

270
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:13,286
risk and compliance. Then we have to understand the different areas which

271
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:16,598
are there which talk about security in

272
00:17:16,604 --> 00:17:20,326
the cloud, like identity and access management, application security, data security,

273
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:24,102
infrastructure security, or anything else. Like there are multiple layers.

274
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:27,130
People say that there are seven layers that we need to understand.

275
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,050
There are seven parts that we need to understand, and it's an integrated thing

276
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,366
wherein we address the physical security, the whole platform security,

277
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:38,654
even the services that we are getting in the cloud. So based

278
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:41,966
on the business needs, companies adopt for different models which

279
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:45,354
are part of the cloud, like whether they want to go for public

280
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:49,170
cloud, private cloud, or even kind of hybrid cloud. And now

281
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,834
a thing called multicloud. So organizations have started to talk

282
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:56,578
about it. And when we are selecting the appropriate cloud, okay, this is what I

283
00:17:56,584 --> 00:18:00,534
need. We need to understand the deployment model, what kind of deployment model we will

284
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:04,006
be going by, and the type of application that we have,

285
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:07,926
the data sensitivity we have. We have to very much understand that and

286
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:11,066
the kind of business process importance, who will be

287
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:14,266
our target users. So it's very important. And if we

288
00:18:14,288 --> 00:18:18,646
talk about single deployment or development and management exercises

289
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:22,010
across the platform, if I talk about public,

290
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,658
private and hybrid cloud, it's important to understand the basics

291
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:29,274
that what do we need? If I am okay to take the route

292
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:33,118
for public cloud, or if I'm okay to take the route of private or a

293
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:37,458
public cloud, or do I really want to be a

294
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:41,246
part of multicloud strategy. So it's all depend on organization.

295
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:44,818
And the most important thing that we need to understand is that we need to

296
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:48,914
have a proper plan to address the security components that are part

297
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:52,086
of our security architecture. If I talk about network security,

298
00:18:52,188 --> 00:18:56,278
I need to understand that what will be my

299
00:18:56,444 --> 00:19:00,086
boundary protections or if I'll have isolation or not,

300
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:04,150
what will be the network access control would be there, or boundary protection

301
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,026
would be there for my web application or not, whether I will also have

302
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:11,866
a firewall which is there for my internal resources. I have seen cases

303
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:16,014
where we are talking about web app firewall or WAF for

304
00:19:16,052 --> 00:19:19,406
our external resources, but we tend to forget our

305
00:19:19,428 --> 00:19:23,134
internal resources. If there is an internal attack happens,

306
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,738
for God's sake, nothing should happen. If that happens, how are

307
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:30,146
we going to detect that, especially on our internal applications? We have so

308
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:33,182
many internal applications in the organizations, could be HR,

309
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:36,466
could be internal employee apps, or even for

310
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:39,874
learning portal. So there are so many applications that we have,

311
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,206
or there are some mission critical applications that we have. So how

312
00:19:43,228 --> 00:19:46,658
are we going to handle that situation? How are we going to address the concerns

313
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:50,362
which are there with the identity and access management? Especially now

314
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:54,214
when we are not in the four walls of an organization,

315
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:57,802
it becomes even more important to address these access

316
00:19:57,936 --> 00:20:01,574
or authentication or authorization related

317
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:05,134
flaws. How about having multifactor authentication, and not

318
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:09,118
just for the people who are privileged users, but for everyone and

319
00:20:09,284 --> 00:20:12,766
adopting the principle of least privilege, how are we

320
00:20:12,788 --> 00:20:16,762
going to, can we have different authenticator management systems?

321
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:20,386
Like I'm not comfortable in getting OTP on my phone. I have

322
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:23,826
seen a lot of recent cases wherein it was

323
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,042
cloned and then attackers gained lot of money

324
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:30,646
out of it. So those are SIM card issues. But then again those

325
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:34,342
are concerns. And when we talk about cloud, cloud is like,

326
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:38,102
if I get your credentials, especially root credentials, I can own

327
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:41,658
your network. And the fun fact is that for

328
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:44,694
one of the project I was working, it's not a recent incident,

329
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:48,074
but sometime old incident wherein the

330
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:51,562
developers were using the root credentials and I was like, wow,

331
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:55,054
if these credentials go anywhere, what could go wrong? The whole

332
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:58,446
applications can go down, or somebody might have access to anything and

333
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:02,174
everything at the same time. We need to address the concerns which are there

334
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:05,790
for our own application and workload security like vulnerability

335
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,946
scanning, understanding the virtual services which are there,

336
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:12,498
or the ingress points that we have. And now when

337
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,742
we are talking about Kubernetes services or services,

338
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:18,834
we need to understand that, how are we going to provide the access to that?

339
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:22,310
And are we going to have role based access what kind of access

340
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,054
are we going to have? So it's very, very important to have. We also would

341
00:21:26,092 --> 00:21:29,546
need to address the data security concerns, whether the data would

342
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:33,434
be encrypted at rest, motion or in

343
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:36,138
transit. Are we going to have TLS, endpoint security,

344
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:39,466
confidentiality and integrity, or are we going

345
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:43,342
to have encryption key management? So these are the things that

346
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:46,602
if we don't understand on, we're going to be in trouble.

347
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:50,302
And last but not the least, if we don't log it,

348
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:54,334
we can never safeguard ourselves. So how are we going to manage our

349
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:57,826
audit events, relevant audit logs, where are we going

350
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,978
to store it, for how long we are going to store it, how are we

351
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:04,194
going to protect our audit information? At the same time,

352
00:22:04,312 --> 00:22:07,666
what infrastructure we would be monitoring, where the

353
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:11,654
audit records would be there for retention. So it's very, very important to

354
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:15,400
understand that. And when we talk about architecture services.

355
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,702
So this is the architecture which I picked up from one of the social media

356
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:23,258
sites. I don't know who posted it, but yes, I found it really relevant that

357
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:26,954
these are the things that we need to address, which starts with the

358
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:31,110
whole strategy, planning and then having the right governance,

359
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:34,878
doing the gap analysis or education, which is important,

360
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:38,890
the training for the teams are very important. Doing the right kind of risk assessment

361
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,290
is very, very important. So we need to have an architecture review methodology

362
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,642
which starts with data flow diagram. And even

363
00:22:46,696 --> 00:22:50,466
before that, when I talk about the new normal that we are in,

364
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:54,594
businesses have to have a quicker and agile transition to the cloud,

365
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:58,658
which is with cloud enabled operations. This means thriving

366
00:22:58,674 --> 00:23:02,530
a lesser known environment with unprecedented threat,

367
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:05,638
which I don't know what we are going to be doing with those threats in

368
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:09,478
the cloud. So these unprecedented times or

369
00:23:09,564 --> 00:23:13,162
unknown times have taught us so many things about

370
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:17,002
our own environment. So this time has tough us a lot.

371
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:20,758
Were should we start off? We should first start off with the data flow diagram.

372
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:24,622
We need to understand our own cloud architecture infrastructure and

373
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:28,398
this will be done by referring to target organization, where we

374
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:32,474
need to have a high level cloud architecture. So data flow diagrams

375
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:36,370
actually help in that. Then we have to have a proper threat modeling done

376
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,334
of our cloud infrastructure and there has to be proper resources

377
00:23:40,382 --> 00:23:44,562
that should be created for that. We also have to have a risk based plan

378
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:47,926
that, okay, this is how we are going to move to the cloud. These are

379
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:50,886
the things that we need to safeguard. This is where we are going to be

380
00:23:50,908 --> 00:23:54,006
landing. And we need

381
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:57,654
to have adequate visibility on our environment and

382
00:23:57,772 --> 00:24:01,654
understand our own environment with a gap analysis.

383
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:05,366
Where is the gap? How should we address that so let's

384
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:09,274
start with the threat modeling. Threat modeling is crucial, as it

385
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:13,278
sounds, or it help teams to proactively understand and

386
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:17,130
develop a strategy for identifying the potential threats

387
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,526
early. And for cloud, it's very, very important to do

388
00:24:20,548 --> 00:24:24,254
the threat modeling of our own environment. There are multiple models which are

389
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:27,506
there like stride, pasta, trike, wasp. There are so

390
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:31,778
many. I have been working on stride a lot lately, and I

391
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:35,010
really like the kind of model stride is. And when we talk about

392
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,770
threat modeling, threat modeling can be done as a code. And threat modeling,

393
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,774
we need to understand that this is not just code as well. So the tool

394
00:24:42,892 --> 00:24:46,374
is less important than the data recorded. So we

395
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:50,202
have to have data recorded in that and using a tool already.

396
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:54,186
Okay, keep doing so if you're doing it. Whiteboarding is

397
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:56,886
my favorite. So I always say that for threat modeling,

398
00:24:56,918 --> 00:25:00,586
whiteboarding is like, amazing way to go. How are we

399
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:04,254
going to have the threat models that we have created for longer run?

400
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:08,046
Now, there's another thing that we have to understand. When we are doing the

401
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:11,502
threat modeling, we need to create data flow diagrams. Now, when we create

402
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:14,958
the data flow diagrams, we need to define our trust boundary.

403
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:18,318
And when we are creating those trust boundaries,

404
00:25:18,414 --> 00:25:22,126
we need to understand the whole architecture, especially this new normal

405
00:25:22,158 --> 00:25:26,222
demands businesses to have a quicker and agile transition.

406
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:30,182
So how are we going to connect the systems with the data flow and where

407
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:33,958
the data would be passing through? So it's very, very important to have

408
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:38,066
the whole map. So the advantages of utilizing these processes

409
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:42,090
or application flow diagrams, wherein we can create the threat models,

410
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,486
which are developer friendly, and wherein we can showcase, okay, these are the applications

411
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:49,690
we have. This is the whole architecture that we have.

412
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,754
And it can also help us in creating the process map, which shows how individuals

413
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,438
move through an application. Security professionals and developers can then view

414
00:25:57,524 --> 00:26:01,374
that these applications, if I don't act upon time, how the

415
00:26:01,412 --> 00:26:05,438
attacker might be envisioning them, which is more efficiently

416
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:09,026
prioritizing the potential threat. And if we have

417
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:12,594
a standardization of these threat modeling processes, it can help us in

418
00:26:12,632 --> 00:26:16,126
consistent, actionable output, which can help us a long

419
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:20,294
way. And companies need to govern how data or

420
00:26:20,332 --> 00:26:24,194
how connections to data sets are established, and we need to monitor

421
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:27,926
this data transfer. So data flow diagrams are the best way

422
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:31,270
to go. And employees, organizations need to understand

423
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,746
that the risk of data exposure is huge. And if we don't have the

424
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:38,426
right kind of training around these data flow diagrams, or in general about

425
00:26:38,448 --> 00:26:41,706
cloud security, it can lead us to a wrong way. Now,

426
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,086
we've talked about threat modeling a bit, data flow diagrams a bit.

427
00:26:45,108 --> 00:26:48,414
Now, let's talk about shared responsibility model that we were talking

428
00:26:48,452 --> 00:26:52,110
about in the beginning. So shared responsibility model, talk about that.

429
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,854
What would be the responsibility of the cloud provider

430
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:59,394
and what would be the responsibility of a client or us,

431
00:26:59,432 --> 00:27:03,438
let's say, to be precise. So identifying the security risk

432
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:07,490
management responsibility is very, very important. Clearly chartered

433
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,678
security responsibility model is the way to go.

434
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:14,050
So the Covid-19 pandemic changed the business practices

435
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,066
worldwide and the traditional workspace transformed

436
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:21,754
or changed for many, the new norm, like people are

437
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:25,274
saying, new normal, new norm, which is now a new home office.

438
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:28,746
We are all homebound, we are doing the virtual, we are in

439
00:27:28,768 --> 00:27:32,606
a virtual workspace, all servers are on cloud and we are

440
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:36,446
meeting over different platforms like Slack hangout teams and

441
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:40,222
whatnot. So the cloud is busier than ever. Making cloud

442
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:44,242
security is more important than ever. So in public cloud,

443
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:47,906
there is a shared responsibility model wherein how

444
00:27:48,008 --> 00:27:51,762
cloud security provider and we are going to manage it and security for things

445
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:54,942
like data classification, network controls,

446
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,680
physical security and whatnot. So if you can see on the screen,

447
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,382
we have talked a bit about data classification and accountability and

448
00:28:03,436 --> 00:28:07,042
endpoint protection. We have talked about application level controls, network controls,

449
00:28:07,106 --> 00:28:10,758
host infrastructure, and not to forget

450
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:14,010
physical security. If we don't understand and address

451
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,718
that, that can be a big concern. So based on whether we are running IIs

452
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:21,262
infrastructure as a service or pass implementation, which is platform as a service

453
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:24,798
implementation, we might want to certain the additional security

454
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:28,846
responsibilities that we have. So whether it's in the

455
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:32,046
data center, using a service, server based infrastructure as

456
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:35,506
a server instance or serverless system, or even a

457
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:38,674
past system, we are always responsible for securing our own

458
00:28:38,712 --> 00:28:42,606
data. Talk about information and data. If we don't retain

459
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,842
our control over the information and data which

460
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:49,078
we maintain, we would never be able to understand what is

461
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:52,534
the visibility of our data. We will have zero visibility into

462
00:28:52,572 --> 00:28:56,054
our data and all the data access in our control would

463
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:59,606
never be there. And again, another thing is identity and

464
00:28:59,628 --> 00:29:02,826
access management. So how there are different facets to

465
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,914
it, different terms to it. So if we don't have the right IBM set,

466
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:09,210
which is identity and access management set, right kind of group set,

467
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,178
we don't have a single sign on mechanism or multi factor authentication, we're going to

468
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,734
be in trouble, big trouble. Apart from that, we need to understand the

469
00:29:16,772 --> 00:29:20,350
application logic and code. So regardless of how we choose

470
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,074
to spin up the cloud resources, our proprietary applications are ours

471
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:27,986
to secure and the control throughout the application

472
00:29:28,088 --> 00:29:31,442
lifecycle. If we have moved an application to the cloud, we cannot say that

473
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:35,206
now the cloud provider is going to secure our application? No, there can

474
00:29:35,228 --> 00:29:38,742
be abuses that can happen. So this includes securing our own code

475
00:29:38,796 --> 00:29:42,406
repositories from the malicious or misuse and

476
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:45,974
talking about application build testing throughout the

477
00:29:46,012 --> 00:29:49,926
lifecycle, ensuring that secure production access is there and maintaining

478
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:54,326
security on any connected systems. Talk about virtual

479
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:57,706
machine accesses which are there in the cloud. So it's very important to

480
00:29:57,728 --> 00:30:01,322
have a role based access control or started using the

481
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:05,054
principles of least privilege. So when we spin up

482
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:08,654
the cloud environment, we control the operation environment. And how

483
00:30:08,692 --> 00:30:12,126
do we maintain or control those environments varies based on the kind

484
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:15,866
of instance that we are going for, whether we are talking about maintaining

485
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,426
the operating system. So we have to harden it. If we are maintaining the

486
00:30:19,448 --> 00:30:23,102
applications, we have to make sure that when we are doing the devsecops,

487
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:26,542
we are doing it with the right things. So for the serverless

488
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:29,954
resources, the cloud providers control planes

489
00:30:30,002 --> 00:30:33,830
give us the access to the setup of the configuration. So it's very, very important

490
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,414
to understand what's our control plane and the data

491
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:40,966
planes that will surround us and how the control plane will be

492
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:44,934
managing the configuration. And if a cloud provider is giving us the right to

493
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:49,174
manage that, there's nothing beautiful than that. And in case of server based

494
00:30:49,372 --> 00:30:53,274
instance, we need to understand that. How are we going to manage the identity

495
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:56,634
and directory infrastructure? How are we going to manage our own applications?

496
00:30:56,682 --> 00:30:59,406
How are we going to manage the network controls that are there? How are we

497
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:02,446
going to manage the operating system? I can go on and on. When we talk

498
00:31:02,468 --> 00:31:06,174
about shared responsibility model, there's a huge thing to understand

499
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:09,602
and not to miss. We need to have a right kind of risk based

500
00:31:09,656 --> 00:31:13,454
approach and if we don't have a plan, we can never attain

501
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:17,394
a right kind of shared responsibility model. It will just lie there and nothing

502
00:31:17,432 --> 00:31:20,614
is going to happen. So what are the various data sets plan

503
00:31:20,652 --> 00:31:23,874
to migrate to the cloud? Understand that. What are the regulatory

504
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:27,286
requirements from a trust border perspective? Like there

505
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:30,986
are data centers which are there. If I'm moving the data from one

506
00:31:31,008 --> 00:31:34,614
data center to another, how are we going to manage those cross

507
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:38,390
border perspectives? And do we have policies and baseline

508
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,786
defined to be enforced on these workloads? How does the

509
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:44,926
data lifecycle look like? How are we going to manage our

510
00:31:44,948 --> 00:31:48,234
own data? What are the encryption

511
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:51,726
measures which are there and how do we translate it to

512
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:55,106
the cloud? So the outcome would bring in a

513
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:58,946
clear and documented cloud security roadmap. If we

514
00:31:58,968 --> 00:32:02,494
understand these things, if we have a plan, we understand shared responsibility

515
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:05,906
model. We address the identity and access management concerns and the

516
00:32:05,928 --> 00:32:09,922
concerns which are part of the different layers that we have.

517
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:13,010
Last but not the least, gaining the right kind of visibility.

518
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,974
And if we have the right kind of visibility, we can have the right set

519
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:19,254
of service level agreements defined. What is actually

520
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:23,402
the need of the r for the business. So a due diligence. Diligence is

521
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:26,698
very, very important. And not to forget, we need to have

522
00:32:26,704 --> 00:32:29,942
a kind of right logging and monitoring. We have to have an incident

523
00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:33,982
reporting, a proper response plan

524
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:37,406
that has to be there. What will be the business continuity management if

525
00:32:37,428 --> 00:32:41,054
one data center goes down, what are the legal implications that would be

526
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:44,542
there or if were are contract that I need to change

527
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,246
if I want to move from one vendor to another, what will be the legal

528
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,802
implications or if I want to move services from one cloud provider to the other

529
00:32:50,856 --> 00:32:54,466
provider? And if there is a vendor lock in, how are

530
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:57,778
we going to move past that? So another important

531
00:32:57,864 --> 00:33:01,318
thing is that uptime a right to audit, can we audit the

532
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:04,822
cloud provider? I have seen that cloud providers are not, a lot of cloud

533
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:08,294
providers are not let clients do the risks assessment. Instead they

534
00:33:08,332 --> 00:33:12,282
give the reports which are there. So how are we going to understand that

535
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:15,626
these things are important for us, things which are not

536
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:19,222
to miss, which are latest things and people don't recognize

537
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:23,166
it and don't address it. So let's start with CASP. So Casp is

538
00:33:23,188 --> 00:33:26,430
cloud access security broker which is required as a

539
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,094
central shared security thing which can be there

540
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:34,046
at cloud edge which can help in cloud related traffic monitoring

541
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:37,806
and preventing controls. Another thing would be data user

542
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:41,822
behavior and activity monitoring within and across the authorized

543
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:45,154
and unauthorized SaaS cloud providers. How about using

544
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:49,046
the shadow it and how about using those shadow cloud

545
00:33:49,148 --> 00:33:53,074
and protect that? How are we going to have protection against the malwares?

546
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:56,786
At the same time, understanding the cloud infrastructure, configuration management,

547
00:33:56,818 --> 00:34:00,726
container security, traffic management, threat management. So CASp is

548
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:04,010
the anchored multi cloud safety net is very, very important

549
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,022
for us to use. Now how about were going to address the challenges

550
00:34:08,086 --> 00:34:11,886
which are there across the cloud security providers? We have to address the concerns for

551
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:14,830
identity, authorization and authentication mechanisms.

552
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,002
So we need to have a pragmatic approach towards implementing

553
00:34:19,066 --> 00:34:23,138
all across the cloud providers. Another thing is that application security

554
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:26,526
basics like implementation, configuration and audit

555
00:34:26,558 --> 00:34:30,146
of security design and configuration is very, very important,

556
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:34,078
especially if we have within SaaS has

557
00:34:34,174 --> 00:34:37,606
pass and now functional as a service as well. So what

558
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:41,714
will be the management from the cloud security provider, end IBM configuration

559
00:34:41,842 --> 00:34:44,950
or network configuration? What will they be managing?

560
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,206
What are the services that they are providing? So it's very very important to

561
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:52,778
address these concerns. When we talked about cloud security architecture. Now,

562
00:34:52,864 --> 00:34:56,474
to sum it up, we need to look at the broader picture that we have.

563
00:34:56,672 --> 00:35:00,186
We need to protect the customers, partners and our own business. We work with

564
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:03,406
a lot of partners. We need to think out of the box. We need to

565
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:07,086
have a different kind of understanding about our

566
00:35:07,108 --> 00:35:10,506
own network. I have seen organizations who are moving to cloud, they don't

567
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:13,954
understand their environment well. They don't know what they have in their

568
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:16,830
environment currently, which is a big, big gap.

569
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,334
And if we address that, we address the skill

570
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:24,146
gap that is there. Another important aspect is that

571
00:35:24,328 --> 00:35:27,762
when think about moving to cloud, we need to

572
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:31,366
do the design thinking. Like, okay, this is how my design is

573
00:35:31,388 --> 00:35:34,806
going to look. We need to involve all the stakeholders which will be part of

574
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:38,166
this movement to cloud. There must be multiple teams who would

575
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:41,702
be moving to cloud. So changed is the only thing that is constant.

576
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:45,270
And when we talk about cybersecurity, it's very important to address these concerns.

577
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,034
Now, one more important thing that I want to tell

578
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:52,874
before we go that building a security in the cloud is not

579
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:56,334
an easy task, but not a difficult task. What we can do is

580
00:35:56,372 --> 00:35:59,934
we can start with building the security architecture with zero trust.

581
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:03,578
