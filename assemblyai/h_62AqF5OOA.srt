1
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,366
You. Every January, thousands of people

2
00:00:29,468 --> 00:00:33,074
go out and buy treadmills, and come February,

3
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:37,046
the vast majority of them wind up looking a

4
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:41,126
little bit like this. And there's a reason for that.

5
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,170
Basically, what it boils down to is one simple truth,

6
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,674
and that is that buying a treadmill doesn't

7
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:51,754
make you a runner. Now, you might be wondering,

8
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:55,710
well, wait a minute, what in the world does that have to do with DevOps?

9
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:00,526
Well, as it turns out, there really are

10
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:04,546
no magical tools. So just as going out and

11
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:07,970
buying a treadmill isn't going to magically make you a runner,

12
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,542
going out and investing in bring new CI CD

13
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:16,162
tooling, brand new project management software,

14
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:20,306
et cetera, isn't going to magically,

15
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:24,040
in and of itself, take your team

16
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,014
and enhance your entire DevOps

17
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:32,234
process. Now, don't get me wrong,

18
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:36,266
tools are important. Having the right tool

19
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:39,420
does in fact make a difference.

20
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,854
But the tool itself is only going

21
00:01:43,892 --> 00:01:46,880
to be helpful if it's being used.

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,134
Now, a couple of months ago, I participated in

23
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:54,766
a set of roundtables at GitHub universe.

24
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:59,042
And these roundtables were attended by all

25
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:02,734
sorts of different DevOps professionals, all sorts

26
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:06,610
of different leaders, sea level folks, et cetera.

27
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,294
And if there was one common theme throughout all

28
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:13,414
of the conversations that we wound up having,

29
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:18,206
it was this. The most common blocker

30
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,166
to being able to implement new techniques,

31
00:02:22,278 --> 00:02:25,930
new patterns was team culture,

32
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,858
that all of this investment was being made in the tools,

33
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,280
but nobody was using them.

34
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,898
So rather than focusing solely

35
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:42,160
on what some cool new tool can do for us,

36
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,162
let's instead turn our attention to how

37
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:49,890
we can actually use those tools, how we can actually

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,954
implement the necessary changes to take

39
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:57,640
our DevOps practices to the next level,

40
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,698
and what it really all starts with, and I'm

41
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:05,414
going to work through kind of three main key points here,

42
00:03:05,612 --> 00:03:09,546
is, number one is asking the right

43
00:03:09,728 --> 00:03:14,090
questions. So going back to the beginning,

44
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,658
buying a treadmill doesn't make you a runners. I'm now a

45
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,166
runner. I didn't start life as a runner. It was

46
00:03:21,188 --> 00:03:25,086
something I picked up about ten years ago. And the reason that I

47
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:29,198
became a runner was because my body had

48
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:33,182
found itself in a shape, in a level of fitness

49
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:37,154
that I just wasn't really happy with. So I

50
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:40,562
wanted to improve upon that. But I knew in order

51
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:44,626
to do that, I was going to need

52
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:48,534
some form of exercise, some set of

53
00:03:48,572 --> 00:03:52,374
habits that I was going to be able to

54
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:55,574
stick with. And in particular, I needed something

55
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:59,322
that was going to be portable, and I needed something that was going to

56
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:03,194
give me tools. And the great thing about running is

57
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:06,918
all you need is a pair of shoes. You don't even need that treadmill.

58
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:11,174
And there's always some new race,

59
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:15,038
there's always some personal record that you want to be able

60
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:18,126
to beat. I want to go a little bit faster here. I want to be

61
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:21,630
able to run a marathon. I want to run some

62
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,074
new distance. So I had those challenges and

63
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:28,434
I had something that was portable and so that was

64
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:31,934
going to allow me to achieve my primary goal.

65
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:35,666
What was my primary goal? Well, it was to get myself

66
00:04:35,768 --> 00:04:39,398
fit and to make sure that my body took on a shape that

67
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:43,000
I really kind of wanted it to be able to take on.

68
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,566
Let's bring this then into our software

69
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:51,402
development processes. And we need to start by

70
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:55,098
asking the right changes, by asking the right questions

71
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:58,698
even. And number one is why

72
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:02,106
do we want to change? So it's

73
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:06,080
not just simply a matter of, hey, we want to

74
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,934
start automating CI CD. It's not just simply a

75
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:13,220
matter of we want to

76
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,450
adopt new agile methodologies.

77
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,570
The real question is why? What is it that

78
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,202
we are bring to achieve? I didn't set out just to go run.

79
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:28,646
I set out to try and improve my shape and try and

80
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:32,294
improve my fitness. So what is it that we're trying

81
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,194
to improve? So let's take an example of we have a mobile

82
00:05:36,242 --> 00:05:40,218
app, and our primary challenge when it comes to our mobile app

83
00:05:40,304 --> 00:05:44,586
is we're not as responsive to customer requests as

84
00:05:44,608 --> 00:05:48,300
we would like to be. So we have bugs in our application.

85
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,174
We don't have a really good methodology for

86
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:56,142
taking customer requests, taking customer feedback, being able to

87
00:05:56,276 --> 00:06:00,302
bring that into the product and our process

88
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:04,046
of, in turn being able to add those features and deploy

89
00:06:04,078 --> 00:06:08,078
that, but is also problematic. It's shoddy.

90
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:11,986
So what's our real goal here? Our real goal is to be

91
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:15,734
more responsive. Our real goal is to try and ensure that our

92
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:19,382
mobile app is going to be updated in a

93
00:06:19,436 --> 00:06:23,640
timely fashion. So that's our real goal. That's our real why.

94
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,706
Once we've established that, then we can

95
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:31,562
turn our attention to the how we're going

96
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:35,866
to do that. Then we can start to find,

97
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,478
well, what tools are we missing?

98
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:43,662
What are the challenges, what are the barriers that

99
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:48,030
we currently have? So is our CI CD solution

100
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,014
meeting our needs? And if it's not,

101
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,806
then we can take a look at incorporating that new tool. But you'll

102
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:59,794
notice that we're starting with the why. What is it that we're trying to

103
00:06:59,832 --> 00:07:04,494
really do here? What's the core of it all? Then we can start incorporating

104
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:08,246
those tools and identifying the challenges that are currently getting in

105
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:11,750
the way of us being able to achieve that goal.

106
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,110
Additionally, when it comes to making

107
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,634
these kinds of changes, we want to not just

108
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,534
identify what tools we're going to need, we want to not just identify

109
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:27,850
what processes we may need to implement,

110
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,806
we also need to identify who is

111
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:36,090
key to success. Because again, it's all about culture.

112
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,080
If we can get everybody on board,

113
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,520
the rest kind of doesn't matter.

114
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,662
Now, when people start to look around and try to identify,

115
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:50,740
okay, well, who are going to be the key voices here?

116
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,462
People typically start with the obvious, which is going to be leadership,

117
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:58,330
it's going to be sea level people, it's going to be our managers. And don't

118
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,670
get me wrong, that's certainly going to be important.

119
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,574
That I remember years and years and years ago that I was working

120
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:09,186
with a team to try and help them get from a waterfall

121
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:12,330
methodology to something that was going to be more agile.

122
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,586
And while the manager kept insisting, oh yeah, I'm all

123
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:20,442
for it, I'm all for it, I'm all for it, in reality,

124
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:24,014
he wasn't. And on top of

125
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:28,522
that, he was also listening to a couple of curmudgeonly

126
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:32,174
developers that really weren't on board

127
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:36,034
either. And so as a result, the whole

128
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:39,362
project kind of was doomed from

129
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:42,994
the start here. So we want to identify who's going to be

130
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:46,982
key to success. So certainly, yes, it's going to be all of those

131
00:08:47,036 --> 00:08:50,514
managers, c level people, 100%, but it's

132
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:53,858
also going to be individual developers,

133
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,670
it's going to be my mentors, it's going to be my leaders,

134
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,626
and it's also potentially going to be a

135
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:05,302
couple of those, hopefully lovable curmudgently developers,

136
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:07,690
the ones that are strongly opinionated,

137
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,694
because if I can bring them over to

138
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:15,642
my side, if I can impress upon them the importance,

139
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:20,254
the why we're making these changes now,

140
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:24,386
they can be champions for the cause,

141
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:28,162
they can be champions for the change that we

142
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,530
are trying to implement.

143
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,426
So why are we trying to change? What is that we're really hoping

144
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,014
to do? What are the challenges? What are the roadblocks? What do we

145
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:42,774
need to actually invest in? And then finally,

146
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:46,040
who's going to be key to success?

147
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,114
Once we've established the right questions, then we need

148
00:09:51,152 --> 00:09:54,060
to establish a plan.

149
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,620
So kind of kicking this back again, my plan

150
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:02,958
again, just trying to lose weight, find a particular set of

151
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:07,034
fitness, was to run a half marathon.

152
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:11,406
For those of you not familiar, that's 13.1

153
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:15,410
mile, 21.1 km roughly.

154
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,994
So I had a plan and

155
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:22,306
it was going to be to start from a particular set

156
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:25,938
of mileage very low because I was really just starting as a runner

157
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:29,574
and then building up incrementally until eventually I was going

158
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:33,558
to be able to run that race. So I had

159
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:37,058
a plan. I put that forth

160
00:10:37,154 --> 00:10:41,114
and now it was my job to start to

161
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,580
follow that plan.

162
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,142
So let's now bring this back to our scenario.

163
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:54,074
So we know we've established our real goal

164
00:10:54,122 --> 00:10:58,074
here is to improve upon

165
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:02,254
our mobile app, that we want to be able

166
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:06,046
to be more responsive, we want to be able to deploy faster, et cetera.

167
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:09,902
So let's start by clearly defining

168
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:13,426
success. In my analogy, again becoming a

169
00:11:13,448 --> 00:11:16,766
runner, my way of defining success wasn't

170
00:11:16,798 --> 00:11:19,814
just that I was going to be able to complete the distance, but also that

171
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:23,334
I was feeling more fit, that my clothes were going to fit

172
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:27,538
a little bit better. I want to be

173
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:31,606
able to clearly define success. So that might be that we're

174
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:35,146
bring to reduce the amount of time that

175
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:38,700
it talked for a piece of feedback to it

176
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,358
finding its way into our code base, to it

177
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:47,520
finding its way into my deployed application.

178
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,406
I want to define this is where we are,

179
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:55,006
this is where we want to get to. I want to make sure that it's

180
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:58,994
measurable. I want to identify all of

181
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:03,490
those different metrics so that way I know did

182
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,474
I succeed or potentially did I

183
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:11,000
wind up failing? So, clearly defined success.

184
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,622
The second is to now find the

185
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:19,754
right team, find the right champions to

186
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:23,482
begin to follow our plan, to be able

187
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:26,060
to implement this plan.

188
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,542
Now, hopefully you've already got

189
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:34,446
a handful of teams that are all set and ready to

190
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:38,174
go, but you may need to make

191
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:42,442
some changes to put together the

192
00:12:42,516 --> 00:12:46,370
right set of people to start down this path.

193
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,394
One of the things, of course, that's going to wind up happening as part of

194
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:55,720
this is you're going to

195
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,098
be asking people to change behaviors. Potentially you're

196
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,366
going to be asking them to do new things.

197
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:07,302
And one of the biggest roadblocks is if people have already

198
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:10,060
been bring the exact same thing,

199
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,346
they're going to keep bring that exact same thing.

200
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:17,610
And that's really what we're trying to change.

201
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,534
That's what we're trying to break but of. And so

202
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:24,782
one big strategy that you can use is

203
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:28,302
to start to form new teams. Now,

204
00:13:28,356 --> 00:13:31,966
forming new teams actually does bring an additional set of

205
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:35,714
benefits because it allows me to cross pollinate, it allows me to take

206
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:39,810
experiences from different parts of my organization and

207
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,186
share them together. That lessons that a developer may have

208
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,374
learned over here, lessons that a developer may have learned over here,

209
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,102
we can bring that chocolate and peanut butter together and find

210
00:13:50,156 --> 00:13:53,174
ourselves a more diverse team.

211
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:57,382
Diverse teams are inherently going to be more

212
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,570
successful. But on top of that, if we're already

213
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,962
making this big change that I'm taking these developers and I'm putting them

214
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:06,460
onto a brand new project,

215
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,538
it's the perfect time to now

216
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:14,526
start to implement additional changes. Because after all,

217
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:17,822
if you're already like changing the team that you're on,

218
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:20,958
changing maybe the frameworks that you're using, changing the

219
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:25,214
project that you're working on, you're not going to bring

220
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:29,202
with you some of those mental barriers of I've always done things

221
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:32,530
this way because you're working on a brand new project.

222
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,910
Now is a perfect time to start to develop some

223
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,990
new habits. So identify those teams and maybe

224
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,606
start to form some new teams as

225
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:46,918
you've identifying the teams that can then be that

226
00:14:47,004 --> 00:14:49,950
part of that pilot, that can then be those champions,

227
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,162
find the project for them to work on.

228
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:56,346
Now, in my example, I've been talking about a mobile app,

229
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:59,500
so of course that's then going to be the pilot project,

230
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,626
but that's admittedly

231
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:07,214
overly simplistic and it's being used for purposes of the

232
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:10,606
talk. Instead, what you really want to

233
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:14,302
focus in on is find projects,

234
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:17,746
find components that are going to be

235
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:21,554
meaningful, that are going to be large

236
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:25,294
but not overly

237
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,958
difficult. Try and find a better way to kind

238
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:32,354
of explain that. Sort of a Goldilocks for anybody's familiar.

239
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:35,126
Porch is too hot, porch is too cold. You want to find something that's just

240
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:39,146
right. So this might be an internal service

241
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:43,290
or an internal library that is used in

242
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,954
a lot of different projects. Maybe it's being

243
00:15:46,992 --> 00:15:50,394
shared. And what's nice about that is maybe it's something

244
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:54,126
that's relatively small, maybe it's handling auth or

245
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:58,302
whatever it is that it happens to be doing. But it's really important

246
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:01,870
to the success of the organization, to the success

247
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,666
of multiple applications that are now using this service, that are

248
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,798
now using this particular library. That winds

249
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:12,402
up being like a perfect spot for me to start.

250
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:16,482
So let's start to work on implementing

251
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:19,734
our updated processes. Let's start to

252
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:23,382
work on incorporating some of those new

253
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:27,702
tools, some of those new techniques into that

254
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:31,502
pilot, into that project. Or maybe it's,

255
00:16:31,586 --> 00:16:35,306
hey, we know we're going to be developing something new. Maybe we've been

256
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,554
doing an Android app and now we want to do an iOS app or

257
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:42,282
whatever it is that can also be a perfect pilot.

258
00:16:42,346 --> 00:16:45,950
And again, it's going to have that advantage since we're not already building

259
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,850
it, that it allows us to more easily

260
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,300
incorporate changes to that.

261
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,950
And then lastly, number three is implement

262
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,530
and review. So again, going all the way back to that analogy,

263
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,582
I start running and now I'm going to start to look

264
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,840
at am I having success?

265
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,174
And if I am fantastic, let's identify why and keep doing those

266
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:16,534
things. And if I'm not, then let me

267
00:17:16,572 --> 00:17:20,086
go back and take a look to see, well, is there an

268
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:23,434
existing behavior that I need to change or do

269
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:26,362
I maybe not have the right tool? Do I maybe not have the right plan?

270
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,114
Is there something else that I need to maybe adjust

271
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,790
or update to allow me to have success?

272
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,440
So I'm using an iterative process here,

273
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,834
bringing this back to our example of our mobile

274
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:45,362
app and all of our teams or

275
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,802
our singular team that's now going to be working on this.

276
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:53,060
How can we start to implement these changes?

277
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,814
I think the biggest thing that we can do is

278
00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:02,038
to focus in on adding behaviors rather

279
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:06,280
than changing them from the start. So for example,

280
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,878
one of the things that can be potentially problematic,

281
00:18:13,974 --> 00:18:17,420
that can cause problems is

282
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:22,110
large prs, large pull requests. Because the problem with a large

283
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,502
pr is it's more difficult to review,

284
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:29,694
it's more difficult to roll back. It can wind

285
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:33,490
up making changes to multiple different components inside

286
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,306
of whatever it is that we happen to be building.

287
00:18:36,488 --> 00:18:40,030
And it then in turn becomes

288
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,210
lets manageable. Okay, so I know that

289
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,526
a point that I probably want to get to is a

290
00:18:47,548 --> 00:18:50,870
new behavior of smaller prs,

291
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,434
but I don't want to go to my teams and go, hey, let's start change

292
00:18:56,482 --> 00:19:00,534
this. Let's start now only doing smaller prs

293
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:05,018
because again, that's going to be that behavior that's maybe ingrained into them

294
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:08,154
and we're not ready for that yet. Okay, cool.

295
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,658
We're not ready for that. So instead let's focus

296
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:15,422
in on trying to add new behaviors. So again,

297
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:18,814
kind of going back to that running analogy, I wasn't quite ready yet to

298
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:22,542
start having up all the burgers that I was eating. That's fine.

299
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:25,950
That wasn't the most important thing for me to start doing. The most important

300
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,266
thing for me to start doing was to add to what I was

301
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:32,510
doing in my life. So start lacing up my running shoes,

302
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,150
get out the door and away we go. So rather than

303
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,390
let's change to get all of our developers to start buying

304
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,710
smaller prs, let's instead focus on

305
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,598
adding behaviors. So if we're not already bring code reviews,

306
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:52,170
let's start to add those in. If we don't already have

307
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,346
tools to start doing linting or

308
00:19:56,448 --> 00:20:00,478
automate for checking code quality or

309
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:04,350
to add on unit tests and to start to run those.

310
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,266
Let's add those behaviors in, because here's what's

311
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:12,314
eventually going to happen, is a smaller

312
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:16,306
pr is going to be easier to review, a smaller PR is

313
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:19,934
going to be easier to add unit tests to. A smaller

314
00:20:19,982 --> 00:20:25,198
PR is going to be able to be updated

315
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:28,770
that much easier. And so eventually

316
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,134
what's going to wind up happening is because we're adding on

317
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,618
these new behaviors, because we're adding on code reviews,

318
00:20:35,794 --> 00:20:38,978
eventually people are going to want to make that part easier,

319
00:20:39,074 --> 00:20:42,346
that if I haven't had a burger the night before the run, the next

320
00:20:42,368 --> 00:20:45,434
morning becomes a little bit easier. Same concept here,

321
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:49,334
that if I'm adding on code reviews, code reviews are going to become easier

322
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:53,422
if I'm using smaller prs. So what's going to happen over time?

323
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:57,994
We're going to wind up naturally trending

324
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:01,242
in that direction towards smaller prs.

325
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:05,330
So let's focus in on adding behaviors rather than

326
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,946
changing behaviors, especially from the start. And what

327
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:12,530
we're going to find is that eventually those

328
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,838
bad behaviors, those behaviors that are getting in the way are

329
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:20,230
eventually bring to decrease.

330
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:26,006
Next, document our successes and

331
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:29,900
our failures. Things are going to work.

332
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,010
Things are not going to work. I want to know in both

333
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,234
situations why and what

334
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:41,694
can I do to continue to replicate and build upon my

335
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:45,614
successes and what can I learn from the

336
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:49,694
failures? What changes can I make here to

337
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:53,682
help ensure that we're now going to continue to

338
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:56,450
move in that right direction,

339
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,274
which then leads us to that last little circle there of

340
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:03,060
iterate and grow.

341
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,854
So as we continue to learn, let's now

342
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,006
turn our attention to bringing on another project, bringing on

343
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,960
another team, and continue to grow out from there.

344
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,278
Now, at this point, sometimes people will give me a little

345
00:22:18,284 --> 00:22:21,594
bit of pushback and they go, hey, wait a minute, Christopher, it sounds

346
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:25,178
like what you're really trying to say here is you want to

347
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:28,982
implement change through groundswell solely. And that's

348
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:32,654
not at all what I'm trying to say, because it does need to come from

349
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:37,098
both directions, that I need my managers, I need my leaders

350
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,830
to buy into what we're bring

351
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,594
to do what we're trying to accomplish. That's key to

352
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:48,594
success. But the other part to the key to success is

353
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:51,842
ensuring my developers are there as

354
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:55,970
well. And so I want to be able to grow from both directions

355
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,842
there. So let's continue to iterate. Let's continue to identify

356
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:03,766
what's working, what's not working, what changes can we make?

357
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:07,618
What behaviors can we add on and then continue

358
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:10,460
to grow from there?

359
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,918
Obviously there's no magical

360
00:23:17,014 --> 00:23:19,814
solution. As I said at the top, yes,

361
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:23,760
tools are important, but there is no magical tool.

362
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,720
Change, particularly when we're talking about cultural change,

363
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,718
is bring to take time and there are going

364
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:36,434
to be setbacks. We need to accept that.

365
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:40,942
We need to make sure that we're in this for the long haul,

366
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,738
that we're not just simply trying something, just for

367
00:23:44,744 --> 00:23:48,762
the sake of trying something, that we have a clearly defined

368
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:52,146
goal, that we know what it is that we're

369
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:55,814
trying to do, we know what it is that we're trying to solve. So that

370
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:59,114
way when there are those setbacks, we can bring that

371
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:02,598
right back to the very beginning. And what's the very beginning?

372
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,100
It's asking the right questions.

373
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,994
Bringing in a brand new tool just because

374
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:14,334
it's the cool new thing, just because everybody else is

375
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:17,998
doing it, or to make

376
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:21,854
a reference that some people may or may not get, just because it goes to

377
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:25,674
eleven rather than going to ten isn't

378
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:29,326
going to bring about the change that

379
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:33,102
we hope that it might. What's going to bring about

380
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:36,786
the change is, is defining

381
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:39,640
those goals, defining the why,

382
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,054
finding the right people to then champion that

383
00:24:44,252 --> 00:24:48,226
and then starting that process of adding on the behaviors

384
00:24:48,258 --> 00:24:51,638
that we're looking for, figuring out what it is that's working,

385
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:55,506
figuring out what it is that's not working, and then continuing

386
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:57,380
to make the changes from there.
