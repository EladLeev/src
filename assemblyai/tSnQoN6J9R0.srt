00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,918
You. Hi. I'm going

2
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:32,150
to talk today about postmortems and why I think

3
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,134
we can do more with this technique in the tech community than

4
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:39,366
we are using today. First, let me introduce myself. My name is

5
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:43,142
Fabricio and I've been coding since 2002. I've worked with

6
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:46,614
big corporations and also small startups, and I had my time

7
00:00:46,652 --> 00:00:50,794
in academia as well. Nowadays I'm the CTO at BXBlue

8
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,334
and this is the experience that led me to what I'm trying to show you

9
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:58,302
when I things about postmortems, I see in the community a grim face

10
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:01,994
about it. Even though there is this shared knowledge

11
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:05,386
that it's a powerful learning tool, we are always focused

12
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:08,706
on the failure part, but I believe there is more for us to

13
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:12,354
extract from it when we look at what we can celebrate and

14
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:15,906
what we can improve on it. So let me share about it

15
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:20,146
first. Looking what is a postmortems? According to the dictionary,

16
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:23,746
a postmortems is an examination of that body to determine

17
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:27,062
the cause of death. This definition comes from medicine, but it's pretty

18
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:31,046
close to what we think about postmortems when you're looking in tech as well.

19
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:34,038
It's not a surprise when you look for the definition of postmortems,

20
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:38,026
according to the PMBok, is that it's a process used to identify the

21
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,038
causes of a project failure and how to prevent it. So it's

22
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:46,206
similar to what medicine defines, with a twist that we're looking here not

23
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,630
only to determine the cause of death, but also to

24
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,914
learn from it and avoid it in the future. The counterpart

25
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:57,102
of a postmortems is a pre mortem, where instead

26
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:00,686
of looking to the past, we're looking to the future. And it's

27
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,098
a process used to foresee the possible causes of a project

28
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:08,274
failure and mitigate it. So it's a risk analysis that we're

29
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:12,134
trying to improve on what we are doing and avoid those

30
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:16,006
risks in the future. But when you want to look forward and you

31
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:19,494
want to try to foresee those risks, you have

32
00:02:19,532 --> 00:02:22,958
to learn from it in the past. So a post mortem

33
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:26,586
is one of the biggest tools to do a good premortin. And when

34
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:29,974
you're looking for a post mortem, for me, the best definition

35
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:33,886
of a postmortems comes from its synonym, autopsy, which comes from the

36
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:37,294
greek sing for yourself. So it comes from experience,

37
00:02:37,412 --> 00:02:41,034
yourself, your mistakes. And for me, this is a good postmortems.

38
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:45,218
It's a tool for learning. It's a tool for recording the history of a company,

39
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:48,830
of a product, the tasks and the moments that were shared.

40
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,210
So what some people experience it, other people

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,438
can also experience as well and share this context,

42
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,806
share these learnings. It's a communication tool for all

43
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:02,146
the teammates in a company. But the types

44
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:05,666
of postmortems that we are used, CTO, it's very limited. So I'm

45
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:08,934
going to share some other types, some other techniques that you can

46
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:12,522
use to improve on your postmortems. So I classified six

47
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:16,234
different types of postmortems, including the classic ones and

48
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:19,162
some new ones. So the first one is the classic one.

49
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:22,938
Those closure is the one defined for the pinbot.

50
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:26,586
It's not restricted, but usually started for project and it's

51
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:30,126
focused on reporting what succeeded. So you can double down on

52
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:33,902
that and what failed, so you can learn from that and

53
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:37,406
avoid that in the future. The second one is the root

54
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,326
cause. Analysis is the most common one. When you see a tech blog

55
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:45,214
about a post mortem, usually it's targeted on failures and downtimes,

56
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:49,014
and it's focused on reporting why it happened and why it

57
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:52,646
won't happen again. It tries to give the sense of security

58
00:03:52,828 --> 00:03:56,822
that you know how to fix it or that you already fix

59
00:03:56,876 --> 00:04:00,214
it and it won't happen again. A new one that I want to introduce

60
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:03,514
is the detective. This postmortems tries to

61
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:07,702
recreate, usually in a first person, a step by step description

62
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:11,678
of what happened. It's a good way to share with other people

63
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:16,206
what were your process of thinking when you're handling with a situation.

64
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:20,286
This will allow other people to look on your process

65
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:23,786
and learn from it, or even allow you to improve

66
00:04:23,818 --> 00:04:27,042
on your process itself. A different type, and is a very

67
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:30,702
uncommon one, is the open problem. It reports those findings

68
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:34,206
of an ongoing issue or a pain point without an implemented

69
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:37,846
solution yet. So here we are talking about something that is

70
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:41,222
not fixed or even you don't know the solution on how to fix it.

71
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:45,254
But it's very useful because you're onboarding what

72
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:49,958
you learned and inviting other people for either contributing

73
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:53,626
with the design of the solution or the investigation of

74
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:57,306
the problem. Or even if it doesn't come CTo be

75
00:04:57,328 --> 00:05:01,178
solved right now when it comes back in the future, you know

76
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:04,686
where to start from and you don't start from scratch. And those

77
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,414
last one, and not least, is the celebration. I'm pretty sure

78
00:05:08,452 --> 00:05:12,158
that you celebrate your achievements with your team, but usually

79
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:15,474
these are shared celebrations and they are pretty

80
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:19,010
much already defined. But each person has a different

81
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,450
learning curve and each person can have a different point of view.

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,438
But what is an achievement for them. So celebrating about

83
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:30,546
why things are important, it's very helpful

84
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:34,630
on recognizing that each person has a different

85
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,102
perspective on the team. So with those different types of

86
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:42,090
postmortems, what can you do? CTO keep up and do it in your team.

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,106
So first, schedule some time for it. Be it after a big event

88
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,594
or something that you think that you should record that

89
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:53,374
learning process or that context. Schedule some

90
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:57,150
time and just write it down. Then agree with other people

91
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,494
where you should start it. So other people know where to

92
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:04,398
look for context and where to find what happened

93
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:08,222
and when. Then after you write it down, collect some feedback,

94
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:12,322
not only to share what you learned with other people, but also to see

95
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:16,594
what they think about what you're writing. Also, they can share some light about

96
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:20,630
other things that you didn't notice and you also could learn from your experience.

97
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,482
Then share it, be it right away or afterwards.

98
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:28,070
When you see something similar happening. Share your postmortems so other people

99
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,674
can also learn from it and get some value from it. And also

100
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:35,306
the most important, just start doing it when you start doing it. If you

101
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,114
don't have the other parts already figured out, they started fitting CTO

102
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:42,698
place. So this is it. I hope I shed some light about postmortems

103
00:06:42,714 --> 00:06:47,150
for you, and I hope your interest had

104
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,166
a little push forward about starting yourself trying these

105
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:54,990
new types of those postmortems. I'm very eager to learn

106
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,054
about how you're doing your postmortems and how they are helpful or not

107
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:03,790
helpful or your challenges, and I'm very open

108
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,780
to discuss. So till next time.
