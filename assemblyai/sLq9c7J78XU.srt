1
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,418
This is the next phase of IoT and information and visualization

2
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:30,134
with digital twins. Let's get started a little bit about

3
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:34,754
myself. I am Tati Hikopian, a program manager

4
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:37,682
working with digital integration in the built environment.

5
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:41,526
I've been a course author and speaker for topics like

6
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:45,378
coding and building information modeling. So let's

7
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:49,106
get started with what are digital twins? Simple explanation

8
00:00:49,138 --> 00:00:52,686
here is a digital twin is a digital representation of

9
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:56,078
a physical object or system. For example,

10
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:59,770
you might have a robot arm like this. You would see in many different factories

11
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,240
as the physical object,

12
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,606
and you might be able to copy it as a digital twin

13
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:10,338
in a digital environment. Like in this example, where we see on

14
00:01:10,344 --> 00:01:14,210
the upper left inset a manipulating a robot arm

15
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,906
in real time, and then this digital representation in the larger

16
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,266
picture, showing the robot arm movements

17
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:24,360
as it is displaced from the original position.

18
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,122
This is a really good, straightforward example of what a digital twin does.

19
00:01:28,176 --> 00:01:31,942
It just replicates what's going on in real time in the physical

20
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,734
environment. So the ingredients of digital

21
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:38,860
twins is IoT, cloud,

22
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,102
and data. The IoT is just a device that is able

23
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:46,000
to be connected to the Internet at large.

24
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,106
The cloud and network infrastructure behind it lets

25
00:01:50,138 --> 00:01:53,918
you send the data over and

26
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:57,618
store it someplace. And then the data itself is the useful application

27
00:01:57,704 --> 00:02:01,646
we get out of twins, and they work in conjunction together. And let's

28
00:02:01,678 --> 00:02:05,814
talk about the use cases of digital twins in the world today.

29
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:09,270
There's manufacturing, factory automation, and simulation.

30
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,190
There's vehicles, tracking vehicles, sensors,

31
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,526
healthcare devices for monitoring the human body, which includes something as

32
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:21,354
simple as an Apple Watch or pippit that could track steps or

33
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:24,618
your heart rate. And then there's structures and buildings to

34
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:28,682
monitor your energy use, and equipment and buildings. Also useful things like trying to

35
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,646
track the displacement of a bridge over time to make sure it's

36
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:36,106
within tolerances. So what are the benefits of digital

37
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:38,590
twins, and why do people use them with IoT devices?

38
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,586
Well, it's real time. You can see what's happening with your physical

39
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:46,386
assets without having to send someone out there to check it, or going

40
00:02:46,408 --> 00:02:50,398
through some very intensive process to figure out what's

41
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:54,194
actually happening in the environment with the monitoring twenty

42
00:02:54,232 --> 00:02:57,622
four seven, you have always a picture at hand

43
00:02:57,676 --> 00:03:00,630
of what's going on with your physical assets.

44
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,130
It also provides historical data on things like maintenance,

45
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,334
operations, and metrics in one

46
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,422
place. That way, if you want to know what's been happening for a day,

47
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:14,074
a year, many years, it's at your disposal. You don't have to worry about

48
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:17,594
trying to collect disparate sources of information to understand the

49
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,158
history of your asset. You don't have to go through binders and

50
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:24,334
paper logs to get information. It's digital, it's in one place,

51
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:28,190
it's easy to sort through, and it's scalable

52
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,494
from small to large projects, because the fundamentals don't really change

53
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:35,966
that much, no matter how big you go. And you could predict outcomes

54
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:39,506
based on historical data and the metrics you're tracking, which is very useful for

55
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:42,130
things like maintenance and expansion of operations.

56
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,450
And this all leads to shared benefits for owners

57
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,538
of, say, a real estate portfolio.

58
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:53,382
You can understand where your assets are,

59
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:57,282
how they're performing, and how to improve

60
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:00,550
operations for long term return on investments.

61
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,700
Building managers and equipment managers can understand the

62
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,970
activity of the equipment at hand. For example, if you manage a

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,902
school as a facility manager, you can figure out with some IoT

64
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:16,514
connected devices like agarometers,

65
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:19,998
if there's some kind of leak in the lives. And instead of waiting until you

66
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,802
have a flood in the hallways, you can get an alert,

67
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:28,002
track it, and get ahead of the fix before there's any problems in school and

68
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:31,838
equipment manufacturers. If your devices are already enabled and equipped

69
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:35,646
with IoT devices on the edge, you could support operations remotely.

70
00:04:35,678 --> 00:04:39,058
If there's any kind of issues with the equipment that you sold

71
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:42,594
to somebody, warranty, upkeep, downtime,

72
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:45,846
you name it, you can get ahead of it by being able to tap into

73
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,902
the IoT gateway. So with that in mind,

74
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,198
there's a whole world of digital twins and visualization I'd like to

75
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,926
get into, because it's being, as you could see by the prior examples applied

76
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,146
in so many different fields in so many different ways. But of course, I want

77
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:02,922
to start with something. Our favorite topic, data standards. And data

78
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:06,202
standards are important. There are many different kind of standards.

79
00:05:06,266 --> 00:05:09,166
Depending on what kind of field of work you do. There's always more than a

80
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:12,782
few, and usually try to do their best to make it

81
00:05:12,836 --> 00:05:16,594
a straightforward, reliable process. But usually get this

82
00:05:16,632 --> 00:05:20,174
kind of situation where people want to make like the master

83
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:23,474
data standard or master standard, and you just end

84
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:27,666
up with more standards. So that's more

85
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:30,886
or less the kind of going on in data for

86
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:34,262
IoT in general. For example, these are different

87
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:37,918
industry bodies that will work on IoT for manufacturing,

88
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:39,820
industry 4.0,

89
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,230
manufacturing for certain types of devices,

90
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,926
like Internet consortium. So there's a lot of organizing bodies

91
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:52,190
around the world that will try to provide some kind of standardization.

92
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,366
So it's not for a lack of standards, it's just for a lack of

93
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,994
heuristics between the standards permeating what is the shared

94
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:03,646
kind of intent and terminology, not necessarily a

95
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:07,202
technical specification, because that really is sensitive to the field you work in,

96
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:10,866
how a vehicle manufacturer and how somebody working in

97
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:15,102
healthcare might have a very different perspective on the technical specifications.

98
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,902
It's more important about the shared language of the ways

99
00:06:18,956 --> 00:06:22,790
you go about getting started and accomplishing tasks.

100
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,406
What's great about that, though, is we now have this

101
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,306
bucket called a digital twin consortium, which brings a lot of different standards,

102
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:34,346
more than what you see here, and tries to harmonize the language and the

103
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:38,394
general operations between them. I bring this up because if you

104
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:42,314
ever wanted to really dive into digital twins, you do have to understand the flows

105
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:46,270
of data. And with something like a consortium standard, which brings in common

106
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,080
language, that becomes a lot more easy to communicate. For example,

107
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,650
they'll provide you with the input,

108
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,980
operational and output concept here,

109
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,658
simple representation digital twin consortium puts together for

110
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:04,018
how you would process reference data. So you don't

111
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,866
have to go into the weeds of a given standard. You just agree that there's

112
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:10,706
a process for taking whatever your x inputs

113
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:13,970
are, going through a system and getting y outputs.

114
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,718
This might seem simple and elementary, but I granted this myself.

115
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,742
Where we take things for granted,

116
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:24,806
we come from different places. I come from a construction

117
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:28,774
and design background. Other people might be coming from a telecom background,

118
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:32,734
other people might be coming from a cybersecurity background. And our terminology gets

119
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:36,746
mixed. So we start early and often with the idea of how to communicate

120
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:40,430
with each other. And even something as simple as a structured

121
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,502
store of information, again, can be very opaque.

122
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:49,454
If you don't specify that, it could be some kind of SQL

123
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,042
database, GIS CAD being point

124
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:56,614
clouds, IoT streams, and different log

125
00:07:56,652 --> 00:08:00,600
lives in history, you name it. Just be very clear and specific

126
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,426
and you won't go wrong. Otherwise, all your data is in an excel

127
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,174
database. Typically, I don't start conversations with

128
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:13,206
data standards first and foremost, but this is something you want to clarify

129
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:17,290
early and often is what are our standards? How do we communicate? Because again,

130
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,018
up and down that chain of IoT and

131
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:24,254
digital twins, there is a lot of communication, and not everybody's going to have the

132
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:28,318
same point of view about what a different term or system

133
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:32,090
that is viable will be. So just FYI,

134
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,534
this is something that is very pertinent in this world. Okay,

135
00:08:35,652 --> 00:08:38,098
now we've got that out of the way. Let's talk about tech stacks and how

136
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,970
you'd actually get anything done. And the fun

137
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,298
part of IoT and digital twins is you have to convert a lot

138
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:49,990
of things to a lot of other things, file formats, data stores,

139
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,226
and there's a lot of interoperability going on here. So it's

140
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:56,934
about as simple as this. Mixed it out to be.

141
00:08:57,132 --> 00:09:00,874
And we can simplify a little better with just this

142
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:04,346
idea of how IoT components and connections come together. Starting with the

143
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:08,422
red box here, the smart devices, whether that's streaming

144
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,302
video, a device, vehicles,

145
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:14,838
equipment, whatever it is, that's your starting point. That's the

146
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,086
real world where all the data comes from. You have to find a way to

147
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:20,990
make sure that somehow is connected to the Internet in whatever

148
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,930
way, shape or form, whatever wavelength standard,

149
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,506
Bluetooth, Wifi, you name it, whatever it is

150
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:30,354
IoT needs to connect. Those are the starting points,

151
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:33,666
which then goes to a gateway, Wifi or, excuse me,

152
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:36,878
the IoT device on its own typically does not have a gateway.

153
00:09:36,974 --> 00:09:40,914
So you have to have a gateway, like a Wifi router

154
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:44,418
or cable connection or some device nearby that can act as a hub

155
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:47,110
to collect all the data and then set it to the Internet.

156
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,962
This might seem like a no brainer, but sometimes your equipment is

157
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:55,882
in some remote area and the bandwidth is not great or

158
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:58,986
connections aren't there. So this is actually a bottleneck you have to work through.

159
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:02,282
Depending where you are. Sometimes your equipment or devices are moving.

160
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,502
Like I mentioned earlier, if you are asking people to use some kind of body

161
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:08,974
monitoring device, depending on where they are and how frequent you want that data,

162
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:12,542
you might have some latency issues. Then you want

163
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:16,086
middleware, whether it's a server rack,

164
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:19,746
a cloud host, some kind of database that can collect all this data and store

165
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:23,266
it someplace and potentially perform operations on it as part

166
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:26,610
of a network stack or platform stack. And then

167
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,322
from there, you can finally use all that great information as your applications.

168
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:34,214
You're basically the front facing way of

169
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:37,846
using digital twins. This is what we usually think of digital twins as the application

170
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:41,274
layer, but it goes all the way back to the hardware and

171
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:44,778
the real world assets. Otherwise, your applications are

172
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:48,186
not going to tell you anything very useful. So as long

173
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,694
as you get this chain going well, you can't go wrong. The thing

174
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:54,942
is, depending on what world you're working in, whether it's built,

175
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:58,526
environment, medical, industrial space,

176
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,294
it's all over the place. You can see here,

177
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:04,986
from manufacturing to urban design to point clouds

178
00:11:05,018 --> 00:11:08,466
to surveying, there's so many different solutions out there. There's even three D

179
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:11,406
engines you can use, like in a real unity to help you create digital twins.

180
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:15,182
So the point I'm making here is it's a very diverse

181
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:18,658
world of technology, and don't feel like there's going

182
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:22,434
to be an out of the box solution. There isn't

183
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:26,166
anything so far that I would really say you can rely on for

184
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:29,642
the next couple of years, at least, maybe longer. You really do have to be

185
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:33,082
sensitive to the different starting points

186
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:36,442
of your data. The legacy software and the up and coming

187
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:40,490
startups make it real. So be comfortable learning

188
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,510
and getting used to different kinds of tools,

189
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,478
because you could put it together yourself or use something like

190
00:11:48,484 --> 00:11:51,614
a data science tool to help you analyze the data. But this is just a

191
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:55,194
smorgasbord of all different kinds of technologies, like Jupyter

192
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:59,074
notebooks, power, Bi Kafka, you name it, that you can use for that

193
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:02,526
as well. So good news is you probably do already have a bunch of tools

194
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:05,966
that can be at your disposal for IoT, edge and neutral

195
00:12:05,998 --> 00:12:09,126
twins. The underwhelming news is you probably

196
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:12,774
have to learn a bunch more, at least be appreciative of other data sources and

197
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:16,230
operations to make this work. So keep it simple.

198
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,070
Don't feel overwhelmed. I'm not trying to intimidate people and make them scared.

199
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,086
Start with something simple lives. Sensors. What are the devices at your disposal?

200
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,210
Are these hypothetical devices that have not been installed yet? They're not available.

201
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,620
They're going to be built or deployed later. Are they real?

202
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:34,186
Pencil that out. Make sure you know what that is. What is the actual sensors

203
00:12:34,218 --> 00:12:38,094
and devices, how they connect to the real world? What kind of

204
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,282
digital representations do you have? Do you have actual 3d models,

205
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:46,526
point clouds? Is it just charts and graphs? What do you have at your disposal

206
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:50,482
and hosting solutions? This is actually becoming more and more an

207
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,842
integral part of the digital twins environment, because even

208
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:57,678
the big cloud hosts are permeating IoT

209
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:00,354
and digital twins specific workflows.

210
00:13:00,482 --> 00:13:04,262
So if you can figure out these three buckets, you're already way ahead,

211
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:08,722
because then it's just a matter of making a framework

212
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:11,834
that's suitable for the solution, because again, it can come from any different

213
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:15,126
angle. One example I like to throw out here is digital

214
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:18,346
twins by Azure. I am just showing here as

215
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:22,026
an example of a company and projects I've worked on have

216
00:13:22,048 --> 00:13:25,210
used Azure, so I thought IoT was a useful reference.

217
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,294
And you can see here the digital twins that zero provides can

218
00:13:29,492 --> 00:13:33,226
be pretty diverse. It's able to draw from many different

219
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:37,102
IoT devices, from vehicles to industrial equipment to manufacturing

220
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,946
to signals. So this

221
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:44,386
is an example of an actual product being released for a cloud platform to help

222
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,858
you package all the data and operations of digital twins.

223
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:51,414
And on top of that, they have an IoT hub. And this is how

224
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:55,426
you would take the different IoT devices,

225
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:58,950
event hubs, and just different data streams,

226
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,190
go through an abstraction layer, and then get actual automations

227
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,074
and functions out of them at the other end. I would say if you're trying

228
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,402
to get things going at a more enterprise friendly level,

229
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:12,906
this is the place to be. Otherwise you might be spending some time experimenting

230
00:14:12,938 --> 00:14:16,298
with different smaller technical solutions.

231
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:19,694
And what's great about Azure is you can start small and scale up

232
00:14:19,732 --> 00:14:23,870
given the technology. But this is also true of AWS. They have basically

233
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,234
their own version of this, and other cloud providers also

234
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:31,874
have something like this, and IoT just lives you a sense of what

235
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,662
you can do. This is Cosmos and IoT Azure. The reason I use this diagram

236
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:39,334
actually is a great representation that I was showing you earlier of the different

237
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:43,554
connections and hardware, the gateways, the data storage,

238
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:47,046
and the presentation. This actually does spell it out. Where on the left here

239
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:50,598
you have the IoT devices at your disposal. Like I

240
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:54,566
said, streaming devices, vehicles go to the gateway hub

241
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:58,234
and from there can connect to the different databases, and the

242
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:01,466
automations provided for those databases give you the

243
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:04,602
insights. And then from there, the actions, applications,

244
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,866
interface. Individual twins. So this is more what's under the hood

245
00:15:07,898 --> 00:15:11,374
and how the framework applies for just one tech stack. Again, there's many

246
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,218
variations of this, but it's a little more clear of how you would actually go

247
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:17,970
about executing these kind of architectures and patterns.

248
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,538
But it can get much more interesting. This is an example of using what

249
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:24,562
they call an ontology model and the

250
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:28,862
palantir foundry platform to get real time data out of flight patterns.

251
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:32,566
So this is getting the weeds. It's not just abstracted. This is

252
00:15:32,588 --> 00:15:36,514
really what you can do with these kind of platforms to get understandings

253
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:40,630
and insights of how complex

254
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,538
systems work. So I would love to go into a

255
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:48,378
whole talk about this, but this is really just kind of an overview to

256
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:51,894
give you how it works, many different technologies

257
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:55,326
and solutions of platforms and providers. But as long as you can figure out

258
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:58,702
a way to get some kind of data set from the devices in the real

259
00:15:58,756 --> 00:16:01,994
world and represent them. In this case, it's just a chart,

260
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:05,182
something fancy, just a chart streaming the data connections from

261
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:08,466
point a to b to c to z, and then be able

262
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:12,098
to host them and spread that information. You pretty much have a

263
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,154
digital twin at that point. So talk real quick about

264
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,702
hardware so you get a sense of what's under the hood. I'll keep this one

265
00:16:17,756 --> 00:16:21,206
pretty short and sweet. Let's say you have a built asset and you want

266
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:23,960
to show off some cool charts of what's going on,

267
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,966
I would recommend going with the

268
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,234
view. There's lots of great information available if you just

269
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:35,574
connect the devices with some kind of spatial recognition.

270
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:38,710
I work a lot with buildings, industrial spaces,

271
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,440
so something of a specialty topic. For example,

272
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:47,818
just a given house or apartment has multiple digitally

273
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:52,590
connected Internet connect devices, thermometers, security cameras,

274
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,370
door cameras,

275
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,906
your own phone. I actually have most of these things in my apartment right

276
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:03,826
now. And most people can have basically everything they need

277
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:07,822
for a setup to represent the different comfort

278
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:10,850
levels and activity of their own home.

279
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,638
So all you do is map it out. This is an important part of the

280
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:16,946
process, mapping out what you got. If you don't know what you got, you can't

281
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:20,566
use it. And usually a lot of the hardware we see

282
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:24,060
is little chips on these devices. But it could be as simple as

283
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,106
an Arduino board or something like an Arduino board. You can hook these up and

284
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:31,818
make your own little custom IoT edge devices. And you could

285
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:35,226
do something like this, slap it on the back of a wall or some equipment,

286
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:39,230
nothing fancy, just make sure the wiring is good and you could already

287
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,002
have something that can report the information. Good for temperature

288
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:46,266
sensing, equipment diagnostics. I mentioned earlier

289
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,938
about the plumbing of the school. There's a serious issue with a lot

290
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,514
of buildings where they leak and they cause us a lot of damage in the

291
00:17:52,552 --> 00:17:56,754
hundreds of thousands of dollars. And they're starting to use hygrometers that are small

292
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:00,166
and compact and retrofitting buildings with them. So if there

293
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:04,274
is a water alert, a humidity alert, it can go to a central database.

294
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:07,702
And it's as simple as something like this where you can quickly wire it up

295
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:11,114
or use wireless methods of reporting it, so that

296
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:14,934
with a modest investment, you can avoid serious cost overruns.

297
00:18:14,982 --> 00:18:18,746
So it doesn't have to be a huge, challenging project, but it

298
00:18:18,768 --> 00:18:22,906
can be. This is an example of the Dearborn vehicle production

299
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:26,254
plant by Ford in michigan. They basically not only

300
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,726
connected all their major mechanical equipment in

301
00:18:29,748 --> 00:18:32,458
the plant that runs the operations to IoT,

302
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:36,302
to have their facility units check status, their equipment,

303
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:40,846
so their really expensive capital expenditures aren't downtime,

304
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:44,034
which stops the whole line of production, but they also mapped it out in 3D.

305
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:47,874
So the next part here, we'll talk about the actual visualization of the

306
00:18:47,912 --> 00:18:51,542
digital twin environment. And what you want to do is make sure that

307
00:18:51,596 --> 00:18:55,426
what you have is useful to the end user. Not for yourself or specialist,

308
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,774
but just an end user that would be able to interact with

309
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:01,978
it and not disappoint them. You don't want to give them a blue screen of

310
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:05,722
death or some kind of glitch that would prevent the access. Remember,

311
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:09,546
we talked about all these examples of the hardware, the technology

312
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,914
stacks, and even the standardization issues. You want to keep these pretty straightforward

313
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:17,598
and effective and not over constraint what you're doing. Otherwise you might have

314
00:19:17,604 --> 00:19:21,342
some glitches. But we'll talk about the visualizations look like,

315
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:25,970
and typically the categories that fall into IoT is a 3d model, some geometric representation.

316
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,238
Charts, charts are great, different kinds of charts showing you bar graphs,

317
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:34,386
if that's something that's very useful for diagnostic information, VRA for

318
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:38,258
immersion, so that you can really clearly see what's going on

319
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:42,066
in a given space. And even simple maps and floor plans are very useful

320
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,606
for the average person, which can be done in multiple ways. Two D at three

321
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:49,138
d projection. So talk about 3d models. Here's an

322
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,974
example that came from the company Autodesk,

323
00:19:52,102 --> 00:19:55,866
and they're showing how you can go through different time of

324
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:59,782
the day. This is just a time series data explaining temperature

325
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:03,506
and lighting in a building. You can see on the right there the numbers changing

326
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:06,320
from different rooms and different settings they have in each room.

327
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,574
What's great about 3d models is they're very intuitive. People like

328
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:13,934
models. They like straightforward models. They can represent a space and

329
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:17,042
orient them very quickly and tell them something

330
00:20:17,096 --> 00:20:21,118
useful very quickly. In this case, you're pairing up a model with some sensors

331
00:20:21,134 --> 00:20:24,866
or giving you room information, and you could take a little further and

332
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:28,354
even make an interactive 3d model. People love playing with interactive

333
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:32,134
3D Models. They love going around and looking. And in this case,

334
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:36,226
we're seeing very nuanced data of the environmental

335
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:40,338
settings in heat maps from room to room. That way

336
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:43,846
people understand it's not just one size fits all reading,

337
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:47,846
but there is a little bit of variation in the kind of information they're

338
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,234
reading. And again, time series data,

339
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:52,640
hourly reporting in this case.

340
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,766
So what's really good about this day

341
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:00,426
and age is most building projects, and most projects in general, even for equipment,

342
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:03,646
they have 3d models. So it's not like you have to go and build

343
00:21:03,668 --> 00:21:07,086
a new one necessarily. You just maybe find one for an engineer

344
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:10,018
or architect and repurpose it.

345
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:13,826
This will make the client happy, because they might already have this asset. And if

346
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:16,546
you don't have an actual 3d model, you can use point clouds, you can use

347
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:20,338
a scanner system. Matterport has something like this. You can even start doing some basic

348
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:23,814
things with your phones. So 3d models are a great way to show up an

349
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:27,000
area space that requires area spatial data.

350
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,390
But you can go a little deeper and talk about virtual reality.

351
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,890
In this example, there is a training going on for

352
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,930
industrial equipment using digital twins.

353
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,958
What's useful about this, what's really beneficial,

354
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:45,406
is you can do remote training and get

355
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:49,210
a really good sense of how equipment works. It's an example of industrial IoT

356
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,370
being used to help workers understand the equipment they're using without having to necessarily

357
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,486
send them all into the same factory floor. This is a much more efficient

358
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:01,058
use of time. If you're just trying to get them used to the ins and

359
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:04,146
outs of something, then we talk about plans. In this

360
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:07,446
case, this plan here is just a floor plan of office, and you can

361
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:10,470
talk about occupancy, utilization, temperature,

362
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,902
equipment, adjacency. This is really useful for just the average office

363
00:22:14,956 --> 00:22:18,722
monitor, average office manager in the average

364
00:22:18,786 --> 00:22:22,214
office building. This could be for schools, medical facilities, you name

365
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:25,578
it. People just want to understand what's going on their space. If you ever been

366
00:22:25,584 --> 00:22:29,450
in a situation where you wonder why one corner of a building is so cold,

367
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,486
this is a great way to figure out what's the highs and lows of the

368
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:37,086
temperature. So this is nothing fancy, nothing hard to

369
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:40,734
do, but it's a great way of visualizing very quickly to somebody what's happening

370
00:22:40,772 --> 00:22:44,962
in their environment and help them manage work

371
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:48,674
environments. But beyond that, you can also start cataloging things.

372
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:52,354
In this example, the visualization just showing you

373
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:55,538
clusters of similar types of equipment. This is

374
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:58,878
from a hospital in the middle, you can see those blue gurneys. Hospitals have lots

375
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,966
of gurneys, but they need to know where they are so they can have them

376
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:04,806
available for the patients. And in a given facility where you have to

377
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:07,240
make sure your equipment is in good order,

378
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,694
inventory, maintenance,

379
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,698
and expansions and replacements are known. This is a

380
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:18,266
great way to figure out what is in your model, or, excuse me, what is

381
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:21,882
in your inventory and project and your building.

382
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:25,002
And it's actually a serious problem for many, many different industries,

383
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:28,142
because they kind of know, they may have an idea, but it's a very human

384
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:32,160
thing. So if Gus in facility management is

385
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:35,838
unavailable that day, you may not have no idea where anything is. But if you

386
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:39,278
have a database like this that represents everything very quickly, and it's been tagged

387
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:42,306
and verified in the field, you don't have to worry about that. You can leave

388
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:45,826
Gus alone and you can really quickly pull up all the different assets and the

389
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:49,426
serial numbers and the product data sheets. Last but IoT least,

390
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:53,398
game engines. This is an example of a data flow on

391
00:23:53,404 --> 00:23:55,942
the left side. All these different 3d file formats, which there are a lot.

392
00:23:55,996 --> 00:24:00,442
Going back to the whole digital twin consortium of putting the data

393
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:04,234
together is actually more challenging. They think in this

394
00:24:04,272 --> 00:24:08,086
case they're bringing in different 3d data assets with different kind of meshes and parametric

395
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:11,510
components into a layer

396
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,246
called datasmith that then goes into unreal, but it can then be hosted through

397
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:18,814
API connections on your cloud of choice. In that case,

398
00:24:19,012 --> 00:24:22,634
in this example of an industrial facility, you might get lots of different engineering

399
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:26,218
model formats from lots of different providers, and they may

400
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:29,934
not be playing nice with each other, they may not be mutually compatible,

401
00:24:29,982 --> 00:24:33,138
I've been there. But if you bring it into a game engine which

402
00:24:33,224 --> 00:24:36,310
handles that kind of exchange,

403
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,486
you can quickly put the industrial and

404
00:24:40,588 --> 00:24:43,734
building and gis and topography together, and then

405
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:46,978
provide the insights from the sensors as well from the cloud hosts.

406
00:24:46,994 --> 00:24:50,982
And before you know it, you have a whole dashboard explaining a very sophisticated

407
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:55,018
large industrial facility like this to clients and

408
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:59,226
operations who want to know what's going on in their spaces, which is actually

409
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:03,310
a serious problem. You'd be surprised how often it's not clear on a given day

410
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,242
how much energy a facility uses or how much of the facility

411
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:10,590
is operational, how much of it is vacant.

412
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,190
It really depends on the facility. So this is a great way to

413
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,666
make it easy for somebody at the top level of c suite or

414
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:21,698
a customer to understand what's going on. And this is a little more customized but

415
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:25,266
totally doable for most built environments and

416
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:28,674
their equipment. And last but not least, the urban scale.

417
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:32,562
This is Helsinki, Finland. They used a layer called city GML

418
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:36,294
as an information model to help organize their city assets into

419
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:40,166
a base layer for them to then host different other objects,

420
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:43,030
like the building information point clouds,

421
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,394
operational data. This is going to help the city understand what's going

422
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:50,486
on in the city, the flows of people, the kinds

423
00:25:50,518 --> 00:25:54,238
of places where activities at help will understand and better service the

424
00:25:54,244 --> 00:25:58,042
city in different utility expansions

425
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:01,850
in need of road work you need because again, it's usually just done manually

426
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,550
based on feedback from people, but you could literally just make it an urban level

427
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,518
digital twin, just like twins. In a sense, Google Maps, with their 3d immersion

428
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:13,774
view is a type of digital twin, but there's no real time reporting besides

429
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:17,058
traffic. So you could take this further and using the kind of

430
00:26:17,064 --> 00:26:20,166
architecture you see on left there, make your own digital twin. Keep scaling it to

431
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:24,134
a regional level, including topography, satellite data

432
00:26:24,252 --> 00:26:27,814
and hydrology, which is what they're trying to account for here. So the

433
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,626
scale is pretty much the

434
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:35,498
sky is the limit. And from here we'll talk about planning if

435
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:39,370
this got your attention, what would IoT take to plan for digital twins?

436
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,418
Well, the cornerstone here is owners,

437
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:46,640
because owners do have to pay for all this.

438
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,414
Usually, whoever's managing the end product, whether it's device or

439
00:26:50,452 --> 00:26:54,046
facility, they're the ones paying for it. So you have to get their ear and

440
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:57,454
you have to build a business case of what is in the proposal.

441
00:26:57,502 --> 00:27:00,498
What are you trying to actually, an RFP, a request for proposal. What is it

442
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:04,130
they're trying to get across? Potentially do a pilot program,

443
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,718
because this might be capital intensive or long term. So maybe you do have to

444
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:11,206
get their approval to work. Everybody's happy with

445
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:15,170
the proof of concept. Describe the ROA

446
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,758
based on the pilot and the RFP to make

447
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:22,426
sure everybody's happy, including the accountants, and look

448
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:25,338
for opportunities to roll these out,

449
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:28,118
because they may not happen all the time. They may be happening one offs,

450
00:27:28,134 --> 00:27:31,994
but once they are, there may get upkeep and

451
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,034
pro tip. You want to be on the leading edge of the adoption curve.

452
00:27:35,082 --> 00:27:39,066
Even if things aren't perfect, this environment around IoT digital twins

453
00:27:39,098 --> 00:27:42,574
and the visualization constantly changes. So the sooner you get started,

454
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:45,874
the easier it is to change. Because if you go on

455
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:49,534
the laggard edge, not the leading edge of the laggard

456
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:53,378
edge, you'll be in a rush to try to catch up with the

457
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:57,218
business need and use cases of digital twins, and then you'll end up with

458
00:27:57,224 --> 00:27:59,654
a Klude. And I worked on many of Kluge, and you don't want to be

459
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:02,886
there. And your project team just needs to be set up so

460
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:04,966
that you assess, plan,

461
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:09,106
document, train, create a common data environment

462
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:12,622
type of digital twin, an early release, a cloud hosting solution,

463
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:16,314
analyze the data, study the trends of that data,

464
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,898
create, update for your operations that are relevant from the

465
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:22,954
data, and then repeat. It's a cycle. And yes,

466
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:26,238
there are many handoffs, and yes, there are many steps that yes, you do have

467
00:28:26,244 --> 00:28:29,694
to be aware of them, because it's not one guy, it's not one app,

468
00:28:29,812 --> 00:28:33,226
it's many apps, many people, some who are not technically savvy,

469
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:36,962
but are very knowledgeable, and you just have to be mindful of the human lives

470
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:40,020
of exchange here. So to get started,

471
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,226
I have a couple of easy steps to help you. It's not as complicated as

472
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:48,130
we have here on this chart. Know what you want, what do you want to

473
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,726
do? What do you care about? What is it you want to get tracked in

474
00:28:50,748 --> 00:28:53,894
digital twins? Any simple thing. What are the

475
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,398
opportunities to apply that we talked about? Pilot project, perhaps maybe a

476
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,662
simple test. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just look for opportunities to apply

477
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:04,266
it, plan it out, chart the critical path and

478
00:29:04,288 --> 00:29:07,722
what it takes to get there and adjust as you go. It's a very much

479
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:11,306
touch and go operation in many cases, until you get the final result and then

480
00:29:11,328 --> 00:29:14,990
you can dial them in. So don't be afraid to modify Iot as you proceed.

481
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,514
Achieve you want building performance? Well, you need lots of sensors and analytics.

482
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:22,926
You want user feedback. Will you need a human facing element to get some

483
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:26,730
kind of survey data or some kind of human appreciation

484
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:30,306
out? If that's what your concern is. If you want people to make sure

485
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:33,298
they're happy with it. If it's not simply a machine spitting out data, you need

486
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:37,426
to make sure humans are giving you some kind of useful feedback and automation if

487
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:40,054
you want to just automate the whole thing. If it's already a solved problem on

488
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:43,720
the performance and evaluation, then maybe you need better

489
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,166
technology automation to get the data fast, because sometimes you have to report

490
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:52,154
thousands of operations a second in industrial equipment to make sure

491
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:56,262
that the data there is useful for maintenance

492
00:29:56,326 --> 00:30:00,314
operations. Bringing Iot all together. So from

493
00:30:00,352 --> 00:30:03,694
the beginning end, create connections to the physical environment, get live

494
00:30:03,732 --> 00:30:07,326
updates from the environment and make sure that reliable have a place to

495
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:10,846
store the data that is nice and secure. Analyze the

496
00:30:10,868 --> 00:30:14,286
data for notifications and usage. Upgrade your

497
00:30:14,308 --> 00:30:18,050
equipment and digital assets over time. Repeat forever.

498
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,330
Because just like the real world that we live in,

499
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,990
nothing stays in one place for too long. Everything changes.

500
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,190
The work keeps going, the ride never ends.

501
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,942
Twins is quite the adventure I've been on over the years from some very

502
00:30:33,996 --> 00:30:37,094
static kinds of data that rarely gets

503
00:30:37,132 --> 00:30:40,666
updated to super frequent data updates and all the

504
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:44,346
different changes in the digital environment over the years.

505
00:30:44,448 --> 00:30:49,322
So it is quite a fun

506
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:52,190
place to be. You never get bored. There's always something you can work on,

507
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,440
so just appreciate that you can't go wrong.

508
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,742
Takeaways digital twins are virtual representation of

509
00:30:59,796 --> 00:31:03,006
physical assets. They are not in and of themselves an

510
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:07,054
operation independent of the physical world. They all exist

511
00:31:07,102 --> 00:31:10,466
in a schema of connected devices. It's not one stream or

512
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:13,838
one flow, but very much a schema of different devices communicating

513
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:17,086
with each other to a digital environment. Use common ground

514
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:20,870
for planning with standardizing bodies and terminology to avoid confusion.

515
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,838
There are many modes of visualization for digital twins. Pick one that suits what

516
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:28,438
you're trying to achieve. Experiment a little bit. Create a

517
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,862
business plan of roadmaps, because these can take a while and they can have

518
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:35,386
many twists and turns. So make sure you chart out a course that can last

519
00:31:35,568 --> 00:31:39,094
for at least a few months, if not a year or two. Find opportunities

520
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:42,638
to use digital twins. Sometimes they're kind of handed to

521
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:46,206
you, outlined to you by other people. Sometimes you can get clever and create

522
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,850
different ways to help people understand the assets and environments they're

523
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,834
trying to evaluate. Here's some additional resources reading

524
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:55,866
about digital twins,

525
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:59,838
standards, enterprises, productivity, you name it.

526
00:31:59,924 --> 00:32:04,080
There's lots of material out here. That's a good starting point for you all.

527
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,086
That's it. Wrapping it up. Thanks so much for joining me in my

528
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:12,066
talk today. I hope you had as much fun listening

529
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:15,174
as I had talking about it. If there's any

530
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:18,674
questions or any outreach, please reach out to me, Tadehhakopian,

531
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:21,874
LinkedIn, GitHub, anywhere. I'm search engine optimized,

532
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:25,138
so you can't go wrong with those letters in that combination.

533
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:28,260
And thank you all again for attending my talk.
