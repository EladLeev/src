1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,430
It. Hi, this is Gordon Rudd coming to you from Conference 42s

2
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,014
Golang conference. I'm going

3
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:37,400
to talk to you today about information security and

4
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,266
specifically how to be a chief information security officer.

5
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:44,838
This is me. Please feel free to connect with me

6
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:48,530
on any social media platform. Give me a call anytime.

7
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,714
We're always here to go. So without further ado,

8
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:56,206
we've got a lot to go through today. I'm going to make sure that we

9
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:59,726
get through everything. And again, if we have any questions, connect with me

10
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:03,040
on social media. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.

11
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,042
We are going to talk about every CISO's 1st 90

12
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:10,318
days and how to achieve lasting success as a CISO.

13
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:13,938
Our agenda for the day is really quite simple. You want

14
00:01:13,944 --> 00:01:17,398
to be a CISO? Yeah, everybody wants to be a

15
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:20,966
CISO. Not everybody, but a lot of folks do.

16
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:24,514
And 30, 60, 90 day plans. You're a CISO

17
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:28,086
now. What should you be doing with your day? What should you

18
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:31,802
be doing for your organization? How should you be conducting yourself

19
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:36,262
and what does a world class CISO look like and creating your roadmap

20
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:40,090
for success. And we want to make sure during

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,286
this time that we're getting your head in the game and that we're

22
00:01:43,318 --> 00:01:46,494
giving you some clues on where to go to next. Because after

23
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:50,394
all, for a lot of people, being a chief information security officer is a dream

24
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:53,518
job. And we want to make sure that when you get that dream job,

25
00:01:53,604 --> 00:01:56,738
you understand what you're getting into. You are not going to be a

26
00:01:56,744 --> 00:02:00,354
rock star. This is a rock star. This is

27
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:04,286
a CISO. Cisos spend a good deal of time being underwater.

28
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,338
That's just the way it works. We are normally

29
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:12,406
a little bit behind the curve. We're trying to anticipate everything that's going to

30
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:16,230
happen. But as you might guess, anticipating what's going to happen

31
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,218
can sometimes lead you a little astray. What I'm going

32
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:23,418
to do today is give you a for sure

33
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:26,694
methodology for making sure that you succeed

34
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:30,166
as a chief information security officer, or chief information officer,

35
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:34,286
or chief technology officer for that matter. I'm going to really begin

36
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:38,090
to outline the measure, assess plan or the map

37
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,710
strategy, so that you can measure what you've got in place

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,086
when you get there. When you get to the new job, you can

39
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:48,254
assess the gap, figure out what's needed, and then you can simply

40
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,698
plan the work and work the plan. It's what we all want to do.

41
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:54,946
And it doesn't better how you came to be the CISO, whether you started the

42
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,598
help desk and went through network administration. Perhaps you were a

43
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:02,178
SoC analyst, maybe even a forensic analyst, and then a CISO.

44
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:06,534
It doesn't matter how we come to it. If you're going to have a

45
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:09,894
great career, if you're going to succeed as

46
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:13,482
a CISO, you've got to make sure that you're monitoring these

47
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,018
nine things all the time, the tone from the top. You've got

48
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:20,398
to watch the board and the senior management team and make sure

49
00:03:20,404 --> 00:03:23,950
that you understand their priorities and

50
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,286
what they perceive to be a complete information

51
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:32,074
security program. You also want to look at your GRC, your governance,

52
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:35,470
risk and compliance, and you want to make sure you stay with the cisos.

53
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,186
The kiss principle. Excuse me? You want to make sure you keep

54
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:43,502
it simple, not necessarily for the stupid, but for the sake of simplicity.

55
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:46,818
You want to make sure that you have employee ownership. The employees have to

56
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:50,118
own the information security program, because information security

57
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:53,590
is a team sport. And you're going to find that you can't do it without

58
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,682
everybody. So let's make them owners, let's get them involved,

59
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:01,162
and we're going to solve problems. And it's not just

60
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:04,886
buying new tech. A lot of times we find that organizations

61
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:08,282
will want to buy a new piece of software, some new

62
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:12,398
service, when they already have something on the ground that'll do it and

63
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:15,040
probably meet every specification they've got.

64
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,290
So we're also going to talk a little about finding your company's rhythm,

65
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,242
about due diligence, collaboration, and automating

66
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,670
everything as much as possible. Automation is your

67
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,322
friend. One of the first things I really want you to do if you're thinking

68
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:34,366
about being a CISO, is take a moment and decide what kind of CISo

69
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:38,666
are you? Are you a technical or a managerial CISO?

70
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:41,846
That's a hands on versus an executive. We've got a

71
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:45,554
lot of different acronyms, three letter acronyms, four letter acronyms,

72
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,646
or tlas and flas that we're throwing around today.

73
00:04:48,828 --> 00:04:51,890
Technically oriented CISO, that's the one that

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,306
would be the hands on CISO. It's usually a one man band, maybe two

75
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,598
or three people. A policy oriented CISO, also known

76
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:01,310
as a business information security officer,

77
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,786
that's somebody that doesn't touch the technology, that just kind of stays

78
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:09,306
in the sea level and makes sure that everything's itoperations

79
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:13,002
correctly from the strategic and tactical

80
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:16,650
levels, not necessarily boots on the ground. Or are you

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,530
strategically oriented CISO, or also a

82
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,050
strategic information security officer? Are you looking forward? Are you

83
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,346
looking at new things and trying to figure out how to dial them? Into your

84
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,798
organization. The first thing I want to make sure we're all doing is

85
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,526
getting our head in the game. And to do that, you're going to have to

86
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:36,678
measure asses and plan or map yourself. You're going to have to

87
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:40,186
do an agonizing self appraisal and find out where your strengths are and where your

88
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:43,274
weaknesses are. You're going to have to know, what are you?

89
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:47,580
Are you the information security CISO that everybody

90
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,214
talks about that can fix anything, or are you the strategy CISO?

91
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:56,286
Are you the executive CISO? You're going to have to figure out who you are.

92
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,934
I always suggest that to do that, you start with a diagram very

93
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:03,570
much like this, and you go through the who you are, where you're going,

94
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,346
how you're going to get there, what actions you're going to take, and how

95
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:10,834
to evaluate and review everything that's going on.

96
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:14,274
Those are stages that

97
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:17,766
will do you well. They will serve you well if

98
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:20,930
you use smart goals and objectives, specific, measurable,

99
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,870
attainable, realistic and time bound. The evaluate and review

100
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,474
that we see over here, this evaluate and review

101
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:31,740
that is absolutely part of the process.

102
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,962
Put times on the different activities that you feel

103
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:40,490
you have to have to make yourself a better executive.

104
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,022
And when you come to that time, mark,

105
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:46,878
reevaluate. You've got lots of things to think about as a

106
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:50,458
CISO today or as any technology executive. You've got a lot of decisions

107
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:53,982
to make. I strongly suggest that you find either

108
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:57,042
a coach or an accountability partner. Either one will do.

109
00:06:57,096 --> 00:07:00,830
You don't necessarily have to have a coach, but you need an accountability partner,

110
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,226
somebody that you can talk to and you can

111
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:08,134
work through the process of saying, I've got these things to

112
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:12,242
do, these are my timelines. And somebody just holds you accountable.

113
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:16,680
And I've always found that using your boss as that

114
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,594
accountability partner doesn't often work out the way you'd

115
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:24,330
think, because a lot of times you want to give some

116
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,638
reasoning why you're late. Many times the boss doesn't

117
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:31,034
have an ear for that sort of thing. I want you to remember that

118
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:35,722
you are running a marathon. As a chief information security officer,

119
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:39,438
however, that marathon is going to be running sprints. You're going to go hard,

120
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:43,198
stop and rest. Go hard, stop and rest. At least we hope you

121
00:07:43,204 --> 00:07:46,478
get that stop and rest cycle in there. So I want to make sure you're

122
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:49,858
ready for this because it's going to be sprint, rest,

123
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:54,126
sprint rest until you get the whole 26.2 miles.

124
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:58,214
Now, to get the job as CISo, you probably

125
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:02,230
had the whole, okay, we're promoted.

126
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,480
We're replacing somebody.

127
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,402
Candidate selection process. At any rate, as you went through all

128
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:13,654
these things, you did the resume, you did the COVID letter, you did the interview,

129
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:17,562
you did all your research at the interview. You should have

130
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:20,730
had in your possession a 30,

131
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,174
60, 90 day plan that you used as a

132
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:28,190
tool to tee up what you think

133
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,126
you should be doing during your first 90 days on the job. That you

134
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:35,674
can also use to find out what your supervisor, what your boss

135
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:39,474
thinks you should be doing every day on the job. That's the beauty of that

136
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:43,474
plan. It's a communication tool for you. And then you're going to take

137
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:47,494
your plan that probably looked like a word document and

138
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:51,110
you're going to break it down like this. You will notice that

139
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,470
before you got there, before day one,

140
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,626
you had a 30, 60, 90 day plan. You understood your manager's

141
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:02,506
expectations. You had a copy of the chart. You'd done your research on

142
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:06,714
the industry, the company, the department. And now you're going to start measuring things.

143
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:10,670
The strategic and tactical, the budget, the GRC policy

144
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,718
and procedure analysis, enterprise risk assessments, that sort of thing.

145
00:09:14,884 --> 00:09:17,706
Assets that are being managed, assets that are unmanaged,

146
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:21,690
vulnerability assessments, personnel skill access controls,

147
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,226
interviews. Those are just a few of the things that you're going to do.

148
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:28,078
You want to understand the change management process from jump.

149
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:31,794
Ask what the change management process is

150
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:35,474
and how information security fits into it. The other

151
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:39,126
thing you want to make sure you're doing is to assess the

152
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:43,110
enterprise's cybersecurity, their architecture and baseline their current training plan.

153
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,454
Software development teams, DevOps teams can be

154
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:49,814
the same thing. Maybe not. Some folks

155
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:53,734
just do development. Some folks do DevOps. We're seeing DevOps

156
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:57,546
take over. But there's still a significant number of organizations out there

157
00:09:57,568 --> 00:10:01,130
today that have the software development teams that are all developing

158
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,926
different pieces for the systems that are found throughout the

159
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:07,930
organization. How the organization is meeting,

160
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,486
all its, you know, it should be NYDFs,

161
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,770
not NTDFs,

162
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,450
CCPA, GDPR,

163
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,498
all those. How are you doing that? And you want

164
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:25,534
to look at your backup management plan. That backup management,

165
00:10:25,662 --> 00:10:29,522
especially if you're looking at a ransomware situation, can save

166
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,838
you. It will save you or kill you, depending on whether you're doing it right

167
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,422
or if you're just not paying attention to it. And then you're going to plan

168
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:40,102
all these things. Corporate information protection plan,

169
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:43,542
that's yours to create. You need to have one. You need to have it blessed

170
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:46,762
by the board. So from wherever you are to the board,

171
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,702
you've got to work your way through those layers of management,

172
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:53,002
filtering that plan, making changes and additions to it until

173
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:56,558
you get consensus on it. And you're going to have to build you,

174
00:10:56,644 --> 00:11:00,654
you're going to have to figure out where you are and where you

175
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:03,746
need to be. So you're going to plan for yourself, you're going to plan for

176
00:11:03,768 --> 00:11:07,630
your executive growth. You want to make sure that you're testing

177
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,358
every bit of business continuity management that the organization

178
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:15,298
has. Business continuity management, again, it's going

179
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:19,682
to make you or break you in any kind of an incident. So prep,

180
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:23,590
measure, assess, plan, mapping everything out. And again,

181
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,126
this is very generic. Yours is going to be different depending on

182
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:30,806
your industry, depending on your organization, and depending on your

183
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:33,930
skill set. Remember, we're all going to start out the same place.

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,146
We're all going to start out with data at the center. That app

185
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:40,042
is going to be, there's going to be an app wrapped around the data,

186
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:43,626
that's pulling the data in and reading and writing the data, storing the data.

187
00:11:43,728 --> 00:11:46,878
There's going to be a host that the app sets on. The host is going

188
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:49,678
to sit on a network. The network is going to have a perimeter, it's going

189
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:53,274
to have physical security. We're going to have policies and procedures

190
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:56,626
for data governance, and we're going to have a security education, training and

191
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:59,778
awareness program. Those are all things we have to have.

192
00:11:59,944 --> 00:12:03,650
Very interesting. When you start looking at it, you must

193
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,718
have those pieces to that puzzle. And the way we put them together for

194
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:11,586
chief information security officer is to create overlapping

195
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:14,966
layers of security to create this model so

196
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:18,898
that you've got your perimeter security. You step inside and you've

197
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,260
got another layer of layer of security.

198
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,906
Some of the items that you might find, like a

199
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:28,890
firewall and VPN on the outside, might have counterparts

200
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,960
in that middle circle. So if you're looking outside

201
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,480
at your perimeter and then looking a step inside,

202
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,398
this would be inside the firewall, that would be forward

203
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:46,062
facing what you're looking at the wild, wild west

204
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:49,682
and you're going to look at your encryption inside. What have you got

205
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,422
inside? Remember, cybersecurity is very complex

206
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:57,634
today. It's not just the agile development cycles or the DevOps

207
00:12:57,682 --> 00:13:01,174
teams that are creating code, packaging it and putting it through

208
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:05,714
change management and an automated process. We've got mobile, we've got websites.

209
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:09,882
Websites today are normally going to be the

210
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:13,530
busiest branch or physical location that you have.

211
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,274
Normally your website will do ten times more business every

212
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:20,778
day than all your physical sites put together. As just kind of

213
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:24,438
a rule of thumb that we're seeing. So that complexity means that

214
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:27,086
you're really going to have to stay on top of things. You're going to have

215
00:13:27,108 --> 00:13:30,782
to make sure that you're pitching in every chance you get

216
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,574
to keep the wheels turning. And to do that,

217
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:38,098
there's a skill set that if you don't have, you need to develop. If you

218
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:41,134
do have, you need to hone it. The security program, creation,

219
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,874
management and operations, creating the program,

220
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:47,738
managing the program and operating the program are three different stages.

221
00:13:47,854 --> 00:13:51,878
You need to be familiar with those stages. You need to understand them. The information

222
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,606
security core concepts. If you're a CISSP, look at

223
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:59,298
the domains that go with that certification. We used to

224
00:13:59,324 --> 00:14:02,534
have ten, now we've got eight. But they're still very valid domains.

225
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:05,638
So those are the core concepts. Encryption,

226
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:09,222
all that sort of thing that's found in those domains

227
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:13,034
is pertinent to your job. You should know those domains, you should be familiar

228
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:16,670
with them. You also need to have the ability to plan,

229
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,270
need to have a rudimentary understanding of finance, risk management and

230
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,454
vendor management or third party risk management.

231
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:27,806
Depending on the size of your organization, your governance, risk and compliance

232
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:31,540
is going to be key. And those five p's, program,

233
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,666
processes, procedures, projects and people.

234
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:40,066
You need to know your programs, your processes, your procedures,

235
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:43,814
your projects and your people. And it's at this point

236
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:47,574
that I would suggest to you that a project that's gone on for more than

237
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:51,250
that's allotted time, let's say just for the sake of argument, it was supposed to

238
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,506
be a year long project. You're going into year three. That's not

239
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:57,498
a project anymore. That's a process. Just call it a process.

240
00:14:57,584 --> 00:15:01,040
Declare the project done, take the win and go home.

241
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,422
And whether or not you're in information technology

242
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:08,750
or information security management, controls and auditing,

243
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,574
that ties into that GRC. How do you control it?

244
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:15,698
How do you audit and what techniques acumen do

245
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:19,218
you need? If you're hands on CISO, you're going

246
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:22,626
to need to understand the technology. And then we're going

247
00:15:22,648 --> 00:15:26,574
to take a look at the organization itself as part of that mapping

248
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:31,106
process. We're going to assess the organizational maturity and the operational readiness.

249
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:34,466
And the way we're going to do that is just use a basic CMMI

250
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:37,946
model so that we're starting down here in the

251
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:41,370
initial stages where all organizations start,

252
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,162
they're all pretty much, this is actually level one

253
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:49,146
down here. They're all pretty much competent people

254
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:53,886
using heroic efforts to keep things going, keep all

255
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:57,646
the wheels spinning round and round every day. And when you move up

256
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:01,786
from that. When you move up to the managed but isolated projects,

257
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:05,502
you start to see basic project management.

258
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:09,620
You start to see different tactics being used,

259
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,834
but they're used inconsistently. And as you move up,

260
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:16,494
you're looking at defined processes, multiple project capabilities.

261
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,766
So all of a sudden at level three here, you're going to be seeing a

262
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:23,206
project portfolio, and projects across the

263
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:26,994
entire organization are all going to be grouped together in one portfolio

264
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:31,398
and managed as such. You get up to level four. It's all counted.

265
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,246
Everything's counted, quantitatively managed,

266
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:37,946
quantitatively operated. Every one of those things

267
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:42,470
is absolutely where you want it to be, but it's counted.

268
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,314
And that's really kind of the bottom

269
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:50,382
line, because the five is going to be part of the defense industrial complex or

270
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:53,600
really big organization, federal government kind of thing.

271
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,534
All that sizing is

272
00:16:57,572 --> 00:17:00,914
to say that we don't want to throw anything away. We want to be able

273
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:04,306
to purchase the equipment we need today and figure out a way

274
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:08,226
for it to scale, because scalability gives the organization economic

275
00:17:08,258 --> 00:17:11,926
flexibility. So as we come up through our network with

276
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,846
our itoperations, systems, applications, the whole thing,

277
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:19,894
123456 serves as

278
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:23,226
we come up the seven layers. The one thing I want

279
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:26,826
you to understand is that every time you build in scalability, you're building in

280
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:30,310
economic flexibility, and that's important to your organization.

281
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,914
Okay. You've got to maintain the confidentiality,

282
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:37,534
integrity and availability triad while you're doing it. But you

283
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:41,306
also need to make sure that it's scalable. You don't want to do forklift

284
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:44,790
upgrades. You want to minimize the number of forklift upgrades you're

285
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:48,126
doing. And you do that by simply remembering that one size doesn't

286
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:51,966
fit all. It does not fit all. You're going to have different solutions

287
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:55,486
as the organization grows more employees than

288
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:59,314
organization has. The differences

289
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:03,206
in not only the infrastructure, but the information

290
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:07,222
security that's involved in securing that infrastructure will

291
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:10,982
change. But I want to make sure that the four points

292
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:14,486
of alignment, and you notice there's actually five things on that slide,

293
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:18,662
but we call them the four points of alignment because you see functionality twice.

294
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,394
You want to stop and say, what functionality do I have on the ground

295
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:26,430
right now? The pieces, parts, the systems that I have in place

296
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,238
today? What's their functionality? What's their capability? Then you want

297
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:34,074
to look at aligning the economics. Does it make dollars and cents?

298
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:36,386
And then you want to look at the talent. Do we have the talent to

299
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:40,194
drive the equipment we have, or is the talent not trained up

300
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:44,254
enough? So the talent your people are telling you that the equipment

301
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:48,862
doesn't function the way they need it to function. Not your optimum

302
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,750
situation to be in, but you can train your way out of that.

303
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,026
And then you want to decide, are we going to use our existing

304
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:58,370
equipment or are we going to use new equipment? Whose equipment are we going to

305
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,820
use and what's it going to look like? And we want to make sure

306
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,426
that you're leaving breadcrumbs, that you're creating a roadmap for

307
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:10,234
yourself. You're using everything you've got,

308
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:13,802
just using all the skills that you've been taught

309
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:17,406
and making sure that you're collecting all the appropriate artifacts. You want to make sure

310
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:20,702
that you're collecting threat hunting artifacts, that you're doing.

311
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:24,334
Log aggregation, every computer on the planet allows you to log everything that

312
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:28,098
happens on it. That can get a little messy because any computer on

313
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:31,634
the planet can exhaust any amount of disk space by

314
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,802
simply sitting there and operating and recording everything to log

315
00:19:34,856 --> 00:19:38,178
files. Log aggregation, log management,

316
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:41,714
very critical. Firewall clustering, AI user

317
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:45,298
behavior analytics are critical for you. Vulnerability management.

318
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,694
If you look at the threat hunting, threat hunting, vulnerability management,

319
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:51,834
and patch management all go

320
00:19:51,872 --> 00:19:55,494
together. So there's a little triad there, a little trilogy.

321
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:59,574
You want to make sure you're aware of your security research, your incident response,

322
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,980
your forensics, your training and cross training.

323
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,698
Those types of things are all artifact

324
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:10,366
driven. You want to record where you are and where you're going. You want

325
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:13,486
to make sure you know how you got where you are, and you want to

326
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:16,190
make sure you're looking at your network and endpoint defenses.

327
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,082
Are we monitoring multiple layers of security? Well, I hope

328
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,506
so. We should be by now. We want to look at our

329
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:27,262
firewalls, our dlp spam filtering, antivirus threat emulation,

330
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,982
HTTPs inspection, bot protection, application control,

331
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:34,706
and ur filtering. It's at this point that I would say, if you're not familiar

332
00:20:34,738 --> 00:20:38,246
with the OWAS model, you should be. If we go back here and we

333
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:41,194
look at the log aggregation, we just say, okay, great,

334
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:45,158
we're going to aggregate these logs. Why do we want to do that? We don't

335
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:49,100
have enough disk space for everything. So if you think about

336
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,306
a stream flowing into a creek flowing into a river,

337
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:57,146
that flows into a lake, that eventually flows into a bigger river and flows

338
00:20:57,178 --> 00:21:00,122
into the ocean, through that entire scenario,

339
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:03,822
you're looking at water on moss moving.

340
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:07,618
You're not looking at the drops of water in it. But as an information security

341
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:10,994
professional, especially if I'm into forensics, I'm looking

342
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:14,846
for the data points. Now, Python has been

343
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:18,370
the biggest thing in the world for security forensics,

344
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,618
and for analyzing log files,

345
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,902
taking care of everything. That is log

346
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:28,630
aggregation. That has been a python

347
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,442
kind of thing for the longest time. My friends that are really

348
00:21:32,576 --> 00:21:35,866
into forensics and

349
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:38,940
investigative services are telling me,

350
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,214
they started telling me this last year, actually, that they're moving to go because they

351
00:21:43,252 --> 00:21:46,846
find go to be easier to use,

352
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:50,446
quicker to learn, and you can do the same thing with

353
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:54,282
less lines of code. Now, I'm not a professional go programmer.

354
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,846
I could best be described as kind of an amateur. As a programmer,

355
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:02,098
I can do a little python, I can do a little go.

356
00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:05,874
And from what I've seen of go, I believe that it

357
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:10,020
has the strength and the flexibility of a.

358
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,598
A python, that kind of thing. But I think it's also a

359
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:17,894
little easier to use for me, it's easier for me to understand.

360
00:22:18,012 --> 00:22:21,542
So I'm looking at go as becoming

361
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:25,478
part of an information security professional's arsenal,

362
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:29,066
a tool that they're going to have in their toolbox. And we know that all

363
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:32,142
those things aren't enough because nothing's foolproof, okay?

364
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:35,678
Users make mistakes, vendors make mistakes. You and

365
00:22:35,684 --> 00:22:38,878
I have both are all, I guess I should say,

366
00:22:39,044 --> 00:22:42,446
gotten overwhelmed. And we've clicked on something that we

367
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:46,114
didn't look at closely, and we all know that what we don't see can kill

368
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:49,374
us. We can start a brute force attack accidentally.

369
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,942
The detecting and evading that the bad actors

370
00:22:53,006 --> 00:22:56,174
do, privilege, escalation, lateral movement,

371
00:22:56,222 --> 00:22:59,926
all those things we need to see. Protocol poisoning, something we

372
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:03,714
needed to watch. How do we gain insight? The AI insight

373
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,206
machine learning cluster, algorithms, you may have

374
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:11,386
to add staff. I like to automate where possible, because when

375
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:14,394
you automate it, the automation doesn't normally take the day off.

376
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,826
It doesn't have to have a vacation, doesn't have to have a

377
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:22,794
child's recital or a sick

378
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:26,302
spouse. Those are all things that happen in life.

379
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:29,806
If you're doing anything with a human, the humans that

380
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:33,822
you've got are going to have the same problems. All humans have nothing

381
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:37,746
wrong with that. Just acknowledge it and say, hey, people are just

382
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:41,060
not going to be showing up every day for work like you'd like.

383
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,882
And that's okay. There are people that AI inside

384
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:49,074
will give you the view you need. So if you look at the behavioral analytics

385
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:52,566
and you learn what your network traffic looks like, which to

386
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:57,046
bake it in is going to take six to nine months. And if

387
00:23:57,068 --> 00:24:00,438
the salesperson says it's shorter than that, you want

388
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:04,374
to look at them. Kind of funny, because I'm seeing more AI installs

389
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:08,326
simply because we're getting a lot more sophisticated at installing

390
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:12,234
them and tuning them up out of the crate. A lot of more AI

391
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:16,554
installs are taking nine to twelve months to actually normalize.

392
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:20,666
And by that I mean to ferret out all the false positives and false

393
00:24:20,698 --> 00:24:24,330
negatives and to actually be useful

394
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,986
for exposing intruders and seeing those individual drops of

395
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,474
water that are flowing around inside. So we always want to use

396
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,782
that. We want to make sure that we're letting it scan the networks and detect

397
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:38,290
new devices and that we're doing it in a controlled fashion.

398
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,934
When you first get your first AI tool, you're going to turn

399
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:46,914
on and see what's on the whole network. Well, that's the wrong answer because that'll

400
00:24:46,962 --> 00:24:50,194
probably cause enough network traffic that for all intents and purposes

401
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:53,090
your average user is going to think that the network is down.

402
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,138
Not a good idea, let's not do that. What are your benefits?

403
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:59,066
Where are you going to keep your vulnerable systems on your radar? You're going to

404
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:02,610
watch these vulnerability notifications that are going to pop up out of these systems.

405
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,646
You're going to be able to assign remediation tasks. You're going to be able to

406
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:09,722
track that remediation and make vulnerability management

407
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:13,246
workable. It's got to be workable. And you decrease your

408
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:16,466
attack surface. So as we're rocking along

409
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:19,774
doing these things, we want to make sure that we're constantly assessing,

410
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:23,426
we're constantly evaluating, and that's supposedly a

411
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:27,094
representation of the old stoplight method, green, yellow and red.

412
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,690
Because your success as a CISO

413
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,834
hinges on your team's ability to monitor

414
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:38,294
the central nervous system of your organization and

415
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:41,866
make sure that they understand everything they're seeing and can report it

416
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,242
accurately to the senior management team and the board. So while

417
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:48,954
we're talking about that, what you do for a living as

418
00:25:48,992 --> 00:25:52,494
a go programmer, as a python, programs anything in

419
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:55,978
it, unless you're talking to another IT professional,

420
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,534
the chances of folks really understanding what

421
00:25:59,572 --> 00:26:03,114
you're doing and who you are are kind of slim

422
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:07,346
to none. So I want to encourage you to over communicate what

423
00:26:07,368 --> 00:26:11,106
you feel like is over communicating. I'm not saying tell the

424
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:14,434
senior management team and the board how the watch was made. I'm saying

425
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,854
don't be afraid to communicate because if you don't communicate

426
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:21,446
they're going to speculate. And that is not a place you want to

427
00:26:21,468 --> 00:26:25,334
be in. One of those first things that you want to do is make

428
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:28,214
sure you're taking a look at this little red box here. You want to make

429
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:31,914
sure that you're looking at your strategic planning and

430
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:35,066
your project requests and how those are coming in and how

431
00:26:35,088 --> 00:26:38,394
you're doing them, because you're going to have

432
00:26:38,512 --> 00:26:42,026
an IT executive board, I don't know if you call it the president's

433
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,434
Cabinet Technology Operations service committee,

434
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:48,842
whatever you call it, you're going to have an IT strategic advisory

435
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:52,366
committee. You're going to have committees of the

436
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:55,562
board, like the audit committee that may meet quarterly.

437
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:59,122
And you're going to have all these issues that you see here.

438
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:02,830
Every one of these issues you're going to have. When it gets down to governance,

439
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,662
I want to make sure that for whatever reason you can

440
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:10,738
rationalize in your head, you put strategic planning

441
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:15,430
and the project request and project prioritization

442
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,142
ahead of all these other things. Because if you can do that,

443
00:27:19,276 --> 00:27:22,426
you can succeed as a CISO today. But you've got to be able to

444
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:25,610
understand the projects, the priority they have,

445
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,890
and how those priorities are going to change over time.

446
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,606
So to do that, you're going to have to communicate. If you're looking at

447
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:36,462
board reporting, you've got to realize that the board is 100%

448
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:41,114
responsible for the organization. In the story, the board governs

449
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:44,350
the organization, not the senior management team, but the board.

450
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,290
Members of the senior management team may have a seat on the board.

451
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,746
That happens. Some will, some won't. You're also going to make sure

452
00:27:51,768 --> 00:27:54,818
that you look at your regulatory guidance. If you're in the finance industry, you're going

453
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:58,466
to make sure that your ffic regulatory requirements are met.

454
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:02,166
If you're in healthcare, you're going to look at the high trust model

455
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:05,686
and you're going to make sure that you're ticking and checking off everything on

456
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:09,094
the high trust model. You always want that tone from the

457
00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:12,010
top, from the board and senior management team.

458
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,534
And you're going to find every industry

459
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:20,026
that has a regulatory body behind it is going to want the board to

460
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:22,714
be involved and they're going to want you to be able to prove the board's

461
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:25,198
involved. So how are we going to do that?

462
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:29,230
Well, boards today, even a small, medium size or small

463
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,006
to medium sized organization, may have as many as

464
00:28:33,108 --> 00:28:36,594
700 to 1000 pages that they're supposed to read every

465
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:40,206
month for a board meeting. Well, now, every board that I've

466
00:28:40,238 --> 00:28:44,430
ever been on, the week before the board meeting, they'll give you a board packet.

467
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,746
Basically they give you an iPad today and you log into a

468
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:51,278
website and the board packet is all online. You've got

469
00:28:51,304 --> 00:28:54,566
800 pages online. You've got a week to read it and oh, by the way,

470
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:57,638
you've still got a day job. It's going to be tough. So you want to

471
00:28:57,644 --> 00:29:00,806
make sure that you set up a frequency of reporting

472
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:04,166
so you're not inundating the board of the senior management

473
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:08,202
team. The board needs to have at least an annual report, should probably

474
00:29:08,256 --> 00:29:12,234
have quarterly reports and an annual summary, at least your governance,

475
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:16,330
risk and compliance, your compliance committee, risk management committee,

476
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,646
technology services committee, that sort of thing. You want

477
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:23,102
to report to them every month, every time they meet. Committees of the board,

478
00:29:23,156 --> 00:29:27,454
like the audit committee, may meet quarterly. You want to report to them quarterly.

479
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:30,722
And you want to make sure that you dial in

480
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:34,446
the board, the senior management and your key stakeholders when you're designing

481
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:38,174
this reporting framework so that they are up to speed on the frequency

482
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:41,846
and the content of the report so they know what to expect, that's good for

483
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:45,494
you. Surprising them, not good for you. Letting them know

484
00:29:45,612 --> 00:29:48,214
what you're going to do and how to do it before you do it gives

485
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:51,882
them an opportunity to put their thumbprint around if they so choose.

486
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:55,722
Always a good idea to give senior management the board an opportunity to

487
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:58,426
dial you into what their expectations are.

488
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:02,570
Cybersecurity board reports should include a total inventory

489
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,886
of everything you're managing, your status when it comes

490
00:30:05,908 --> 00:30:09,038
to threats, vulnerability and patch management. How that's working?

491
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:13,226
Is it working? Is something broken? The organization's risk

492
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:16,014
assessments now cybersecurity,

493
00:30:16,142 --> 00:30:19,406
it does risk assessments. You should do a risk assessment

494
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:22,754
on every new piece of equipment you get, every new projects, every new

495
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:26,114
service. All these have risk assessments. And every year

496
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:29,462
you should be risk assessing everything you've got. So you're going to have

497
00:30:29,516 --> 00:30:32,422
ongoing monitoring activities for everything that's going on,

498
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:36,342
and you're going to assess the risks that are in that and then any

499
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:40,426
material, upcoming contract renewals, terminations, any problems

500
00:30:40,608 --> 00:30:43,786
also need to be reported up. And I always recommend that the

501
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:47,642
board report contain at least one

502
00:30:47,696 --> 00:30:51,162
PowerPoint slide for each of these. Your asset security, these are your

503
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:54,734
columns, I'm sorry, these are your pillars or your

504
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:57,946
domains of information security. I guess domains is the thing I'm

505
00:30:57,978 --> 00:31:01,262
looking for here. It's your domains. So make sure you give them

506
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:05,170
a little information on each one of these and make sure

507
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,290
that the other component you recommend, I'm sorry,

508
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,046
make sure that the other component I recommend is included.

509
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:15,494
And that is a word document that puts more detail into

510
00:31:15,532 --> 00:31:19,174
each one of those sections. It also gives any important industry information,

511
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:23,110
any new regulatory guidance, updates on staff changes,

512
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,318
overall inventory of actively managed third parties, and any

513
00:31:27,404 --> 00:31:31,066
cybersecurity program. Changes, particularly focusing on the

514
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:34,714
changes to high risk and critical areas of operation. You can

515
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:38,614
make sure that you're doing the right thing by finding the right framework.

516
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:42,190
Find a framework, use it. There are many to choose from.

517
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,238
CISO, NIST, ISO, probably where you

518
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:49,326
want to start. If you're in the US,

519
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:53,058
you're probably going to be NIST. The rest of the world, you're probably, especially in

520
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:57,394
the european theater, you're going to be ISO. Find a

521
00:31:57,432 --> 00:32:01,806
framework and use it. Make sure you're assessing risks.

522
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:06,046
Risk comes in, there's really three parts to risk. There's the inherent risk

523
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:09,938
and there's the mitigating activities that are going to reduce the inherent risk,

524
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:13,602
and there's the residual risk and those risks.

525
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:17,926
You need to have an understanding of the people, processes and technology that

526
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:21,962
are going on within your organization, especially within it.

527
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:25,434
And information security. You need to be aware of. You also

528
00:32:25,472 --> 00:32:28,602
need to be aware of the people, processes and technology in

529
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:32,234
every line of business. Because every line of business is

530
00:32:32,272 --> 00:32:36,346
an attack surface. You need to know how the people are working, what processes

531
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:39,886
they're using, what technology they have in place, what are they doing all

532
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:44,510
day and how does it relate to securing the organization and maintaining that confidentiality,

533
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,710
integrity and availability triad?

534
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,214
You're also going to have to manage your team's talent

535
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:54,770
level and your project management capabilities.

536
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,422
Got to have an assessment on that. Standardization, how standard

537
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:03,714
are you? Do you have a standard desktop? Do you have a standard smart

538
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:06,998
device? I'll just say smart device. I keep wanting to

539
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:10,822
be vendor specific. If you've got a smartphone

540
00:33:10,886 --> 00:33:14,266
or a smart tablet, what are your standards for setting those up?

541
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:18,822
What are your standards for setting up a workstation, a laptop?

542
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:22,250
What are your standards? How did you standardize server configuration?

543
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,930
And what are your quantitative management

544
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,594
capabilities? The quantitative management capability that you have, the ability

545
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:33,442
to measure everything you're doing and assess what you're doing based on

546
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:37,470
numbers, based on calculations, based on figures,

547
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,882
based on quantitative analytics is

548
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:44,098
really the Golden Circle because once you get down to that, then you

549
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:47,634
can say, we're running a little shy in this area, we need to flange

550
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:51,094
it up or, wow, we have certainly seen

551
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:55,170
an escalation in the number of bad actors moving past our firewall.

552
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,020
Now, to do all this, you want to make sure that you understand

553
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,778
the skills that you have on your team. This is a

554
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:06,714
very simple skills determination. I think it makes the point

555
00:34:06,832 --> 00:34:09,660
you just take the person that you've got,

556
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:13,470
whoever the person is, the current role they're in,

557
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,214
the skills. Now, one person may have more than one

558
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:21,246
role, and one role may have more than one skills. So you

559
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:24,578
may have these things fanning out on you as you

560
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:27,870
go down. Then what's your current capability

561
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:31,730
and what's your ideal capability for that particular person,

562
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,134
for that particular job, and what's your developmental action

563
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:38,854
going to be? How are you going to bring them up to speed today?

564
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:42,486
I'm going to just go out on a limb and say this. You need to

565
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:46,354
stop looking for the unicorn employee. The unicorn employee

566
00:34:46,482 --> 00:34:50,006
does not exist. It's not there. If you

567
00:34:50,028 --> 00:34:52,780
find the unicorn employee, they're going to want too much money.

568
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,002
And then as soon as somebody comes along and offers them 20% to 25%

569
00:34:57,056 --> 00:35:00,794
more than you're paying them, they're gone. Don't look for that

570
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:03,920
unicorn employee. If one drops in your lab, take them.

571
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,530
No doubt about it. Stop looking for the unicorn.

572
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,342
Start building your team. Build your own unicorns and do it

573
00:35:11,396 --> 00:35:14,894
using a model like this. You can refine it, you can make it

574
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:18,110
do anything you need it to do for your organization,

575
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,666
but get a training plan in place to bring your team up to where they

576
00:35:21,688 --> 00:35:25,874
need to be, and you may have to include it in it. The technology

577
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:29,446
groups oftentimes have to move in tandem, and you needed

578
00:35:29,468 --> 00:35:33,186
to make sure that your people and the IT people have certifications.

579
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:36,946
Well, there are a few certifications out there. I didn't

580
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:40,458
list all the certifications from sans because there are

581
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,554
just tons of them.

582
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:47,430
CCNA, CCIE, all good certifications.

583
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,282
The CISSP is usually the cert.

584
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:55,038
By last figure, I saw 68%, almost 69%

585
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:59,706
of all chief information security officers hold a CISO.

586
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:03,154
So not a bad place to be. Now, remember, when we start

587
00:36:03,192 --> 00:36:07,486
talking about certifications, your certifications, your team's

588
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:11,940
certifications, I want you to understand that

589
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,366
they're going to have to go take tests. You're going to have to take a

590
00:36:15,388 --> 00:36:18,934
test. And it kind of behooves us to stop at this

591
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:23,240
point and take a look at what is

592
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,680
learning. Now, for those of you that have children,

593
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:33,834
especially ones that you might read a bedtime story to, the thing

594
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:36,634
you're going to notice at some point is they're going to want you to read

595
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:40,538
the same story over and over and over

596
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:44,078
and over until you're frankly sick of

597
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:46,734
the story. And then you're going to start,

598
00:36:46,932 --> 00:36:50,254
the child's asleep and you're sleepy, and you're going to start going through,

599
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:53,826
and you're going to be. And you're skip a word and

600
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:57,074
your child's going to say it. Didn't say that it

601
00:36:57,112 --> 00:37:00,574
says this. And even though the child can't

602
00:37:00,622 --> 00:37:03,060
read, the child has the book.

603
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,318
Every time you reread the same book to your child,

604
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:11,046
you're building the child's iq. They're learning.

605
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:14,806
They're building mental capacity. When they

606
00:37:14,828 --> 00:37:17,914
get a little older and they start playing video games, they're doing the same thing.

607
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,414
They're learning, they're building mental capacity in video games,

608
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:25,382
especially games that have problems to solve,

609
00:37:25,446 --> 00:37:29,606
whether it's something that's civilization

610
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:33,774
building or army building. Even first

611
00:37:33,812 --> 00:37:37,710
person shooter games all have the ability

612
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:42,400
to help the individuals that are playing them learn,

613
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,054
increase their iq, and get some serious

614
00:37:47,102 --> 00:37:50,466
problem solving skills. So remember,

615
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:53,826
your employees are going to start out right where you are.

616
00:37:53,848 --> 00:37:57,574
They're going to start out in that comfort zone where they feel safe. The next

617
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,070
zone away from comfort is fear.

618
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,282
You cannot learn when you're afraid, fear releases

619
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:08,790
a chemical in your body that shuts down your frontal cortex.

620
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:12,054
And I promise you, once the front part of your brain,

621
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:16,838
the frontal lobe, ceases to function normally,

622
00:38:16,934 --> 00:38:20,366
and it's in that kind of fight, flight, or freeze state, you're not

623
00:38:20,388 --> 00:38:23,680
learning anything. The learning zone actually

624
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,234
is the next zone over after fear. And the growth

625
00:38:28,282 --> 00:38:31,662
zone actually happens after the learning

626
00:38:31,716 --> 00:38:34,890
zone, where you know the material enough that you

627
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,620
can actually apply it, you can see how it works.

628
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,602
The best example I can give you of that is long,

629
00:38:41,656 --> 00:38:44,926
long time ago for the certified novell administrator

630
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:48,214
exam. I'd been a novel administrator for

631
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:52,422
four or five years before I ever took the exam. And they had know,

632
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:57,030
hey, if you do this, we'll give you a free exam ticket. So our organization

633
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,226
punched the first ticket. We got a free exam. I went and took the exam,

634
00:39:01,328 --> 00:39:04,554
passed it, and never really studied for it.

635
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,810
But then I had worked with Novell long enough

636
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,506
that I was not in the fear zone or

637
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:15,806
in the comfort zone or even the learning zone. You could ask me

638
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,974
how to do anything after working with it for five years, and I could tell

639
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:22,422
you. So I was, at that point, in a growth zone,

640
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:26,018
looking to get better. Not in the comfort zone, not in the

641
00:39:26,024 --> 00:39:28,210
fear zone, and not in the learning zone.

642
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,820
Remember, match your

643
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,014
frameworks to your industry and

644
00:39:37,052 --> 00:39:40,662
to your organization, and make sure that

645
00:39:40,716 --> 00:39:44,326
as you're pulling up certifications and saying, it'd be great if

646
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,846
we had one of those, make sure that that certification fits

647
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:52,118
with the framework. Certification must fit with framework.

648
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:55,382
There are Togaf certifications, Zachmans, ISOs,

649
00:39:55,446 --> 00:39:58,314
itils. Koso's got a cert,

650
00:39:58,432 --> 00:40:02,186
NIST, CFS. I'm sure there's a

651
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,454
cert out there somewhere for it. I don't know off the top of my head

652
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:08,942
where it is, but I'll bet somebody's providing it, and you

653
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:13,982
should have a clock in your head constantly

654
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:17,362
running. I like to

655
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:21,170
justify the technology that I have on the ground that I'm currently

656
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,102
using every 18 months. And 18 months isn't

657
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:28,686
something that it isn't

658
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,342
arbitrary, is what I'm trying to say. 18 months isn't arbitrary. Moore's law

659
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:35,718
says that every 32 months, the power of the technology

660
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:39,798
that we're using doubles. So if you've got technology that's

661
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:43,338
been on the ground for 32 months or more, it's probably time

662
00:40:43,424 --> 00:40:47,386
to upgrade it, because the power that

663
00:40:47,408 --> 00:40:51,754
you can get in that same equipment today

664
00:40:51,952 --> 00:40:55,854
is going to be at least double what it was 36 months ago.

665
00:40:55,972 --> 00:40:59,534
Well, that's all great. Especially Moore's law is a little

666
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:02,880
old. Now. Today, about every 18 months,

667
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,870
the power of the technology doubles.

668
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,834
So you want to make sure that you train yourself and your teams to

669
00:41:10,872 --> 00:41:14,066
justify that technology. And by that, I mean to take a look at it and

670
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:17,918
say, is there anything better out there? If you're looking at firewalls and you're

671
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:22,450
looking at the big players, the junipers, the CISos, the checkpoints,

672
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,862
the palo altos, you're looking at those. If you've got one,

673
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,462
let's say, for the sake of argument, you're a CISO. Every 18 months,

674
00:41:29,516 --> 00:41:32,282
your team needed to come back and say, yeah, Cisco is still the best answer

675
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:35,882
for us, and you want to make sure that you're training every

676
00:41:35,936 --> 00:41:39,722
three months. I like my technology teams to train for five days

677
00:41:39,776 --> 00:41:43,422
every three months. That doesn't necessarily mean they have to go away.

678
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:47,470
They may sit at their desk or stay home or do something

679
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,342
that's self paced learning. But every three months,

680
00:41:51,396 --> 00:41:55,442
they need to train for five days, and we need to train more than one

681
00:41:55,496 --> 00:41:59,074
person to do every particular thing. The old

682
00:41:59,112 --> 00:42:02,802
saying, two is one and one is none, is very

683
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:06,258
real. Make sure that you've got more than one person trained to

684
00:42:06,264 --> 00:42:09,654
do everything. You need at least two firewall drivers, at least two

685
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:13,042
network security administrators, at least two forensic experts.

686
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:16,562
Now, if you have, let's say, two forensic experts,

687
00:42:16,706 --> 00:42:19,586
you know that both of them aren't going to have the exact same skills.

688
00:42:19,618 --> 00:42:21,270
One of them is going to be a little ahead of the other one,

689
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,566
and that's okay. Figure out a way to challenge them so that they

690
00:42:24,588 --> 00:42:28,070
keep one up and the other one, and keep learning and keep raising the bar

691
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,350
for each other. Look at your framework adjustments. Frameworks get adjusted.

692
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,666
Gosh, about every month anymore there's a release

693
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:40,442
that says CISO or NIST is considering changing some framework

694
00:42:40,506 --> 00:42:44,462
somewhere, which means that down the line that framework

695
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:47,954
is going to get adjusted. You need to track those adjustments and say,

696
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:51,374
okay, what's NISt thinking? What's CISO

697
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:55,486
thinking? Where might this go? How should

698
00:42:55,528 --> 00:42:59,590
our organization react to it? And the generally available releases,

699
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,046
you're going to have every twelve to 18 months, a generally available

700
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:07,480
release of every piece of software you've got.

701
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,946
Okay, so we want

702
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:14,380
to make sure that every twelve to 18 months,

703
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,326
no matter what, we're looking at our GA releases.

704
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:22,302
Sometimes those are PRN. If you're in healthcare, you know that that means as

705
00:43:22,356 --> 00:43:25,866
needed, we're going to look at framework adjustments and generally

706
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:29,386
available release adjustments no matter what, every twelve to 18

707
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:32,970
months. And certainly as needed, the vulnerability

708
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:36,594
assessments, you need to be doing those daily. And by that I mean

709
00:43:36,632 --> 00:43:40,014
you're going to be scanning your networks. You're not going to scan the whole network

710
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:44,338
all at once. I think anybody that's been a CISO got

711
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:47,462
really happy and turned on their

712
00:43:47,516 --> 00:43:50,902
vulnerability scanner, got 9 million items for every

713
00:43:50,956 --> 00:43:54,342
thousand employees they had, and sit around

714
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:58,482
scratching their head going, wow, that's amazing. And then they realized

715
00:43:58,546 --> 00:44:01,834
that the call log to the help center went nuts during that

716
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,514
time frame and they're going to be wondering why they go nuts. Well,

717
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:09,706
the bandwidth utilization to do those scans is usually a little more extreme than just

718
00:44:09,808 --> 00:44:13,386
daily operations. So what you're looking at is a situation

719
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:17,326
where you can scan a network and decrease the bandwidth to the point that

720
00:44:17,348 --> 00:44:20,058
the network appears to be down to the end user.

721
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,722
Not a good place to be. So scan small network

722
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:27,742
segments daily. Scan something every day, but make it a different segment.

723
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:31,346
Unless something gets wonky on one of your

724
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:35,154
scans and you want to redo it, scan the next segment. Keep moving,

725
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:39,310
keep those scans going and that clock is going to keep on ticking. You're going

726
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,534
to be doing risk assessments at least annually or

727
00:44:42,572 --> 00:44:45,474
as needed. If you have a new product service or a new piece of gear,

728
00:44:45,602 --> 00:44:49,346
you're going to do code reviews, DevOps and software

729
00:44:49,378 --> 00:44:52,586
development or team sports. Code reviews are

730
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:55,974
a real deal. Isolated programmers

731
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:59,290
creating magic. Doesn't happen very often. Again,

732
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,746
those people are unicorns. Normally you're going to

733
00:45:02,768 --> 00:45:06,206
want to have more than one person reviewing the code that comes out

734
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:09,326
to see if it's efficient, to make sure there's nothing missed, to make sure that

735
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:12,814
all the security parameters you can are dialed into that code.

736
00:45:12,932 --> 00:45:16,594
Your patches every week. You want to make sure you don't have any

737
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:19,220
patches for anything or as needed.

738
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,742
That is one of those things. If we look at Spectra and meltdown,

739
00:45:23,806 --> 00:45:27,586
Spectra and Meltdown come out, I'm read up on them. We made a

740
00:45:27,608 --> 00:45:31,186
decision on what to do and I'm sitting around the day of the board meeting

741
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:34,758
that I'm not scheduled to be at, thinking I might want to

742
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:38,438
be ready to go to this particular board meeting. And time goes by and I

743
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,094
think, well, I'm going to be missing this one. Oh,

744
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:44,210
no. Still got to go to the board and say, hey,

745
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,418
the spectrum meltdown thing, that's a problem. What are we going to

746
00:45:47,424 --> 00:45:50,390
do? And then I had to explain that, yes, it is a vulnerability.

747
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:54,062
Yes, we do have it. No, at this point in time,

748
00:45:54,116 --> 00:45:57,566
nobody's weaponized that vulnerability. Yes, there is a

749
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,954
patch out. At that point in time, Microsoft had a patch,

750
00:46:01,082 --> 00:46:04,154
but our tests have found that if we patch the servers

751
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:07,558
we have in production today, it won't

752
00:46:07,594 --> 00:46:10,606
kill them, but they'll run so slow that the end user will think that they're

753
00:46:10,638 --> 00:46:13,906
down. So that's not something we can do. We're going

754
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:16,994
to have to trust our perimeter security, trust our behavior

755
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:21,042
analytics, and make sure that we're watching our log aggregation

756
00:46:21,186 --> 00:46:25,094
and the AI inside is tuned up and telling us what's going

757
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:28,626
on because we really don't want to patch Spectre

758
00:46:28,658 --> 00:46:32,218
and meltdown right now. And I think everybody went through the same kind of

759
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:36,234
thing and they're all the people that I know in information security going,

760
00:46:36,272 --> 00:46:40,042
well, you're going to have to wait for a new generation of processors before

761
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:43,566
we can do anything with it. That sort of

762
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:47,294
thing happens from time to time. And you're going to find things like the

763
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:51,082
solar winds utilization of a software

764
00:46:51,146 --> 00:46:55,040
repository didn't go exactly like they thought it would.

765
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,154
Those kind of things are going to happen. There's just no way around it.

766
00:46:59,272 --> 00:47:03,054
What you want to make sure you do is have your business continuity

767
00:47:03,102 --> 00:47:07,350
management in place so that you have a place to back up, back off and

768
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,026
make sure that everything you're doing can be restored.

769
00:47:11,138 --> 00:47:14,614
System configuration always happens pre production. You never

770
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:17,766
put a system in and produce it.

771
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:21,546
And the roadmap that you're going to have for cybersecurity for

772
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:25,690
any organization better include these nine items. Your security education,

773
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,806
training and awareness program. Who are your stakeholders?

774
00:47:28,918 --> 00:47:32,426
Who are they? Well, senior management, the board and heads of the lines of

775
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:35,806
business and anybody else that might be a key player for

776
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:39,146
you. Watch your numbers, watch your budget numbers, your number of employees,

777
00:47:39,178 --> 00:47:42,414
your burn rate. Burn rate is a term that you're going to hear

778
00:47:42,452 --> 00:47:46,174
venture capitalists use. Burn rate simply means, what does it

779
00:47:46,212 --> 00:47:49,778
cost to keep the doors open every day? So, for your information security

780
00:47:49,864 --> 00:47:53,010
program, you should be able to tell your senior management team,

781
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,386
your board of directors, anybody that asks, this is our burn rate. It cisos us

782
00:47:56,408 --> 00:48:00,166
this much every day or this much every month to keep information security

783
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:03,446
going. You should know that number. You should also be

784
00:48:03,468 --> 00:48:06,790
able to show what the organization is getting for that number

785
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,426
and know your four p's or your five p's, depending on how you look at

786
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:13,814
them. Your policies, your procedures, your processes,

787
00:48:13,862 --> 00:48:17,066
your projects, all those four things make up a program.

788
00:48:17,248 --> 00:48:21,014
So programs, policies, procedures, processes, and projects,

789
00:48:21,062 --> 00:48:24,554
you got to know them. What's your security architecture? Are you too tall?

790
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:28,414
If you're too tall. Tools. Hierarchical. You're not going to be able to shut down

791
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:32,014
segments efficiently without downing entire work

792
00:48:32,052 --> 00:48:35,842
groups that you don't intend to down. You want your network to be

793
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:39,122
as flat and as horizontal as possible. So if you do have something

794
00:48:39,176 --> 00:48:43,390
that happens to one network segment, oh, let's say ransomware

795
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:46,914
happens, if that happens, then you can close that segment down.

796
00:48:46,952 --> 00:48:50,134
You can isolate it, you can do your forensics on it, you can

797
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:53,862
maintain your chain of custody on it, and you can handle the problem without

798
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:56,818
it affecting the rest of your network, the rest of your plant.

799
00:48:56,914 --> 00:49:01,414
Make sure that your assets have been identified. Business continuity

800
00:49:01,462 --> 00:49:05,194
planning, disaster recovery planning. You got to have it. You got to

801
00:49:05,232 --> 00:49:08,806
understand it. You got to understand your recovery time objective, your recovery

802
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:12,490
point objective, and your maximum allowable downtime. The business

803
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,574
impact analysis is the tool that you should,

804
00:49:15,712 --> 00:49:19,594
if you're not involved in it, you should get involved in, because the BIA,

805
00:49:19,642 --> 00:49:22,830
the business impact analysis, will rank every process in the entire

806
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,482
organization for every line of business, and then

807
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:29,938
it'll tell the it folks, this is the most important

808
00:49:30,024 --> 00:49:33,794
process. That gives them the ability to say, that process runs on that

809
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:36,998
system. So that's the most important system we've got. We need

810
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:40,774
to make sure that either doesn't go down or can come back up within our

811
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:44,550
recovery point objectives. Recovery time objectives, and certainly

812
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,870
within the maximum allowable downtime.

813
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:51,546
Training. Training train. I think we made

814
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:55,066
the point on training. If we haven't, give me a call. We'll talk about

815
00:49:55,088 --> 00:49:58,678
it. Five areas where successful cisos excel.

816
00:49:58,854 --> 00:50:03,190
Well, cisos are usually smart, but they're also emotionally smart.

817
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:08,030
They also have their emotions in check, so their IQ and their EIQ are

818
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:11,594
in line. They have the ability to communicate. They have the ability

819
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:15,554
to talk to the board of directors, the senior management team, align a business or

820
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:19,122
an audience, such as yourselves, and they

821
00:50:19,176 --> 00:50:22,798
have technical kung fu instead of krav maga.

822
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:26,386
If you know anything about martial arts, you understand that kung fu

823
00:50:26,418 --> 00:50:29,810
is a very elegant art form. Krav maga

824
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,574
is extraordinarily brutal. You really want to

825
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:36,466
strive for technical kung fu versus Krav maga?

826
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:39,526
Now, we've all thrown stuff together to get it running in the middle of the

827
00:50:39,548 --> 00:50:43,082
night, and at 09:00 in the morning, you're going,

828
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:46,394
darn, we were up all night, and we've got this combo together, and we still

829
00:50:46,432 --> 00:50:49,770
got 72 things we need to do to make it stable.

830
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,614
We've all been there, but as much as possible, work your way out of that

831
00:50:53,652 --> 00:50:57,086
and get back to the elegance that, you know, your technology should have.

832
00:50:57,268 --> 00:51:00,574
High performance team building. Every successful C

833
00:51:00,612 --> 00:51:03,566
level, anybody, doesn't matter if it's a chief financial officer,

834
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:07,294
chief operating officer, chief information officer, chief technology officer,

835
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:10,702
chief information officer, or chief information security officer

836
00:51:10,846 --> 00:51:13,602
has the ability to put high performance teams together.

837
00:51:13,736 --> 00:51:17,574
If they don't, I'd suggest that the board needs to find somebody else.

838
00:51:17,692 --> 00:51:20,934
The third party risk management. Got to do

839
00:51:20,972 --> 00:51:24,386
it. You got to understand how to handle third party risk

840
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:27,362
today, because your vendors, vendors,

841
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:31,010
vendor could be the Achilles heel in your organization.

842
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:35,194
If you're not doing third party risk management, you're not doing it correctly. You're never

843
00:51:35,232 --> 00:51:38,826
going to find that out again. What you don't see, what you

844
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:42,926
don't know, can kill you. And remember, you're always going

845
00:51:42,948 --> 00:51:46,606
to be measuring, assessing and planning. You're always

846
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:49,822
going to be going through this loop. Measure it,

847
00:51:49,956 --> 00:51:53,714
assess it. It's a gap assessment. And then what's the plan to close

848
00:51:53,752 --> 00:51:56,958
the gap? Very simple stuff. Measure,

849
00:51:57,054 --> 00:52:00,206
assess, plan, map.

850
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:04,434
The information security department, the people in it, and the organization it

851
00:52:04,472 --> 00:52:07,954
serves. Sounds simple. It'll take you a little time,

852
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:11,894
but it's very insightful. It's a very insightful task or

853
00:52:11,932 --> 00:52:15,880
set of tasks. Very insightful project. Let's call it what it is. It's project,

854
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,382
and we want to make sure that we're developing organizational

855
00:52:19,446 --> 00:52:23,222
specific tools to accurately determine the capabilities

856
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:25,770
and operational readiness of the department.

857
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,594
My big tell on operational readiness, when we work

858
00:52:29,632 --> 00:52:32,746
with clients or somebody comes to me and says, I think

859
00:52:32,768 --> 00:52:35,614
I'm good to go, you want to take a walk through with me? The first

860
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:39,242
question I ask them is, well, show me your sock. Your security operations

861
00:52:39,306 --> 00:52:42,800
center. They may say, well, we don't have a sock. We've got a

862
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:47,410
nox job. Isn't exactly the same

863
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,870
as a sock, network operating centers and security operating systems

864
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,806
do have overlap, not the same. A good sock should

865
00:52:55,848 --> 00:52:59,686
have the ability to manipulate network segments and perform

866
00:52:59,788 --> 00:53:03,426
some exhaustive forensics from the SoC. I would submit

867
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:06,758
that a network operating center doesn't have a

868
00:53:06,764 --> 00:53:10,118
need to do that. Sometimes I get a

869
00:53:10,124 --> 00:53:13,434
little blowback on that. But for the most part, the sea level

870
00:53:13,472 --> 00:53:17,146
people that I work with really understand that you want to make sure that

871
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:20,426
you've got a security itoperations better because it's going to be doing

872
00:53:20,608 --> 00:53:24,014
a set of tasks with a set of tools that are different from

873
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:26,750
what the technology folks, the it folks are doing.

874
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,786
And you want to make sure that you're creating the people, processes and technology roadmaps

875
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:34,718
for your entire information security department.

876
00:53:34,894 --> 00:53:38,642
You're going to measure the department, the people, the organization it

877
00:53:38,696 --> 00:53:43,374
serves, and you're going to assess same department,

878
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:46,402
people organization over and over again.

879
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:49,894
We're going to do this and then you're going to plan same thing for

880
00:53:49,932 --> 00:53:53,206
this department, for the people, and for the organization that

881
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:57,266
you're going to create that information security plan for your entire organization.

882
00:53:57,458 --> 00:54:01,402
You're looking at that team, you're looking at your information technology team.

883
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:04,474
You're looking at your third parties. You're assessing them.

884
00:54:04,592 --> 00:54:08,378
You're making sure that they understand that you're going

885
00:54:08,384 --> 00:54:11,498
to plan the work and work the plan that you've got a strategic plan and

886
00:54:11,504 --> 00:54:14,686
you've got some tactical plans. You need to share those.

887
00:54:14,788 --> 00:54:18,346
That's where your competition or speculation comes in. What is your strategy?

888
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:21,946
What are your tactics? That should not be something that's

889
00:54:21,978 --> 00:54:25,422
a secret. If it's a secret with a closely held group, well,

890
00:54:25,476 --> 00:54:28,626
it's not a plan. Plans are something you can lay out on the table and

891
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:31,666
show everybody, this is where we're going, this is how we're doing it.

892
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,522
This is what it looks like. Please feel free to come on down,

893
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:39,330
do whatever you want, and you're going to measure your progress against your plan.

894
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,786
Plans have to have a timeline on them. And as Elon Musk

895
00:54:42,818 --> 00:54:46,454
said, if you allow a project to take a month, it'll take a month.

896
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:49,222
If you allow it to take a week, it'll take a week. Same project.

897
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:53,286
He's right. You've got to measure your progress, put a timeline on it that's

898
00:54:53,318 --> 00:54:56,282
realistic and measure the progress against it.

899
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:59,414
Demonstrate your program's effectiveness,

900
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:02,762
demonstrate the process effectiveness that you have within

901
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:06,718
your program and demonstrate the level of security that you have

902
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:10,174
to your senior management team, the heads of the lines of business and your board

903
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:13,678
of directors. And make sure that you constantly,

904
00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:17,006
constantly, constantly are measuring, assessing, and planning your industry,

905
00:55:17,118 --> 00:55:20,414
your organization's lifecycle position within the industry.

906
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:24,014
You're always looking at the industry expanding or contracting.

907
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:27,302
When you're looking at those things, see if there are ways that you can

908
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:30,818
actually help your company disrupt the industry.

909
00:55:30,914 --> 00:55:34,642
You're always looking for that disruption potential. Make sure that you have critical

910
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:38,022
infrastructure designations in your

911
00:55:38,076 --> 00:55:41,862
mind. The Homeland Security Department has 17 or 18

912
00:55:41,926 --> 00:55:45,226
critical infrastructure designations. If you're one of those,

913
00:55:45,328 --> 00:55:48,550
there's a lot of help out there for you. If you're in the finance industry,

914
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,598
defense, industrial complex, healthcare, communications, that sort

915
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:55,646
of thing, they being the Department of Homeland Security and

916
00:55:55,668 --> 00:55:59,854
the whole federal government, have a lot of resources. And make

917
00:55:59,892 --> 00:56:03,486
sure that you don't have too much culture shock for you or any new

918
00:56:03,508 --> 00:56:06,670
people you bring on. If you're looking at that operational readiness,

919
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,274
we want to make sure that we absolutely, positively, as we

920
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:14,370
talked about, looked at that BIA, RPO, RTO and

921
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,006
maximum allowable downtime. And in the

922
00:56:18,028 --> 00:56:21,366
business impact analysis, everybody can't be number one. You've got to

923
00:56:21,388 --> 00:56:25,106
define that criticality which comes from the tone

924
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:28,806
from the top. And you want to make sure that you also have disaster

925
00:56:28,838 --> 00:56:32,346
recovery, pandemic planning and incident response in your

926
00:56:32,368 --> 00:56:35,546
business continuity management plan. And you want to make sure that

927
00:56:35,568 --> 00:56:39,194
you understand disaster recovery only recovers three

928
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:42,886
things. We recover people, facilities, and systems. We recover

929
00:56:42,918 --> 00:56:45,326
them in that order. And the reason we do it is because if we don't

930
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:48,714
have people, we don't need facilities. If we don't have people or facilities,

931
00:56:48,762 --> 00:56:52,558
we certainly don't need systems. So we recover the people, put them

932
00:56:52,564 --> 00:56:55,770
in facilities or send them home. Home is a facility,

933
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:59,502
and we make sure they've got the systems they need. And we're going to assess

934
00:56:59,566 --> 00:57:02,734
risk. We're going to look for the context that a risk

935
00:57:02,782 --> 00:57:05,714
has. We're going to identify it, analyze it, and then we're going to look at

936
00:57:05,752 --> 00:57:09,746
handling it. We're going to accept it, mitigate it, transfer it, avoid it or exploit

937
00:57:09,778 --> 00:57:13,394
it. And risk analysis is really simple. You should have a risk appetite

938
00:57:13,442 --> 00:57:17,334
statement. If you don't, the thing I would encourage you to do is simply ask

939
00:57:17,372 --> 00:57:20,430
your chief financial officer what's a material loss.

940
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:24,362
Now, I've done that before, and when I'd asked the first time,

941
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:27,050
the CFO would say 25,000,

942
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,126
I'd ask him five years later and he's 300,000. So the risk appetite

943
00:57:31,158 --> 00:57:34,410
of the organization moves. The risk appetite of the organization

944
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:38,606
in different areas also moves. But you're always always going

945
00:57:38,628 --> 00:57:42,346
to be looking at the threat times, the vulnerability times, the consequences,

946
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:46,406
gives you your inherent risk. Your inherent risk minus

947
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:49,906
your risk mitigation is going to give you a residual risk and you're going to

948
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:53,374
be doing things that look like this. That's the same inherent

949
00:57:53,422 --> 00:57:57,106
risk you just calculated it. It moves to the next equation

950
00:57:57,298 --> 00:58:00,440
and you're going to put simple things together like this.

951
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:05,234
The earthquakes in Oklahoma is something that we lived through prior

952
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:08,458
to the early OS. We may have had one or

953
00:58:08,464 --> 00:58:11,386
two earthquakes every year or two,

954
00:58:11,568 --> 00:58:14,922
maybe in 2009, we had almost

955
00:58:14,976 --> 00:58:18,954
1000 earthquakes in Oklahoma. Virtually every

956
00:58:19,072 --> 00:58:22,254
square mile of Oklahoma had an earthquake in it.

957
00:58:22,372 --> 00:58:28,126
So while the probability pre 2009

958
00:58:28,228 --> 00:58:31,742
was close to one, it wasn't zero, but it was close to one.

959
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:35,470
The probability during 2009 was close to 100%.

960
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,654
So those risks are going to change and you're going to be doing risk assessments

961
00:58:38,702 --> 00:58:42,226
that are going to look like this. And of course this

962
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:45,518
is online for you to go back and look at later and you're going to

963
00:58:45,544 --> 00:58:49,046
expand them that look like this. And these

964
00:58:49,068 --> 00:58:52,902
are the risk assessments that you need to be doing. And you need to be

965
00:58:53,036 --> 00:58:56,710
aware of change management and how

966
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,426
change management differs from the Internet of things all the way through the

967
00:59:00,448 --> 00:59:03,702
SDLC. DevOps has a change management

968
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:07,446
style that's different. Agile has a change management style

969
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:11,180
that's different. You need to understand those and adapt to them.

970
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:15,102
Now, how do you adapt since

971
00:59:15,156 --> 00:59:18,686
we really have no logical alternative? Well,

972
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,514
you look at your hard skills and your soft skills, you look at your comfort

973
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:25,399
zone, and then you always surround yourself with smarter people. They're going

974
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,430
to help you figure out alternatives, logical alternatives,

975
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:32,066
alternatives that will work in your environment. And that's really what you want.

976
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:35,700
You want to make sure that you can do exactly

977
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,794
what you're planning. You want to be able to measure your skills with a skill

978
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:43,234
matrix, your EIQ, you can use a Myers Briggs,

979
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:46,646
you can use a disk assessment, you can use true colors, any of

980
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:49,686
those. Don't just do it for you, do it for your entire team.

981
00:59:49,868 --> 00:59:53,334
It will help you put together a better team. Look at your risk

982
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,586
appetite, look at your obsolescence. What is

983
00:59:56,608 --> 01:00:00,042
your end of life looking like for every piece of equipment you've got?

984
01:00:00,176 --> 01:00:03,802
Your team's composition, what are their hard skills, what are their soft skills?

985
01:00:03,946 --> 01:00:07,086
Where do they need help? Where do they need to be trained up?

986
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:10,382
Be willing to invest in your team, get them

987
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:15,214
certifications, get them more than one. There's always same

988
01:00:15,252 --> 01:00:18,626
certification slide, always a way to do it, always a way to make

989
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:22,386
it happen, even if it's lunch and learns. And remember, not everybody can

990
01:00:22,408 --> 01:00:25,198
get all the way over to the growth zone. A lot of people are stuck

991
01:00:25,214 --> 01:00:29,394
in comfort. They hit that fear zone when we start talking about certs.

992
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:31,986
To get them over it, you've got to get them through the learning zone,

993
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:34,754
and that's repetition, repetition, repetition,

994
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:38,466
repetition. And let's have a few final thoughts here, since we're

995
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:41,894
running a little long. I always like to make sure that the wire

996
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:45,418
is done right up front, that your network infrastructure is perfect.

997
01:00:45,584 --> 01:00:49,766
And for my money, you cannot have too much memory spinning disks.

998
01:00:49,878 --> 01:00:54,006
Why, they're a little archaic anymore.

999
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:57,674
It costs a little more to get some SSD, but I'm going to submit

1000
01:00:57,722 --> 01:01:01,118
that it's kind of the way to go. I've had a lot of

1001
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,334
good luck with it over the last five years. Some of the early fits and

1002
01:01:04,372 --> 01:01:08,030
starts seem to have worked out, so I don't really have a problem with it.

1003
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:11,154
Asset management, you got to know what's on the wire. When the wire's working,

1004
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:13,742
you got to know what's on it. Make sure you know what's on your wire.

1005
01:01:13,806 --> 01:01:17,042
Personnel people can be your best asset,

1006
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:21,490
so take care of them. And the CISO

1007
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,750
has released its best practices to save you from being

1008
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:29,626
disrupted by ransomware. Filtering network traffic to

1009
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:33,174
prohibit ingress and egress communications with known malicious ip

1010
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:36,550
addresses. Very important strong spam filters.

1011
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:40,490
Phishing. A set of programs. Security education, training and awareness.

1012
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:43,802
Extremely important. Implementing robust network

1013
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,562
segmentation between information technology and the operational

1014
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:52,042
technology networks is critical. Regularly testing manual

1015
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:55,794
controls. If it's manual, you got to test it at least every week and

1016
01:01:55,832 --> 01:01:59,666
ensuring that backups are implemented and regularly tested. Backups should

1017
01:01:59,688 --> 01:02:03,550
be tested every day. You don't have a good backup unless you've tested it isolated

1018
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,642
from your network connections. Oh my gosh,

1019
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:10,610
let's get our backups off of our network connections.

1020
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:15,126
You got to do that or you end up backing up the

1021
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:18,098
cryptography that's encrypting your network with ransomware.

1022
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:21,610
So when you go to restore, you're just restoring a bad situation.

1023
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,006
Don't want to do that. And again, please don't hesitate

1024
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:30,054
to connect with me on social media. Send me feedback

1025
01:02:30,102 --> 01:02:33,806
on what you thought about the program. And please

1026
01:02:33,988 --> 01:02:37,214
have a good day. Make sure that you're doing

1027
01:02:37,252 --> 01:02:40,506
everything you can to stay secure. If you want to be a chief

1028
01:02:40,538 --> 01:02:44,154
information security officer, that you keep a career

1029
01:02:44,202 --> 01:02:48,174
map in your mind and go ahead and write it out, plan it

1030
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:51,486
out, map it out for you so you can be

1031
01:02:51,508 --> 01:02:55,110
a world class CISO. That's all I have for you today.

1032
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,662
Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to

1033
01:02:58,716 --> 01:02:59,940
hearing from you in the near future.
