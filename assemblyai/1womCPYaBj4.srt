00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,486
You. Hi everyone. Thank you so

2
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:47,246
much for joining me. This talk will be about incidents management. Talk the

3
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:50,926
talk and walk the walk. When I was in high school, the common belief was

4
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:54,606
that if youll actively listen in class, you'll have 50% of

5
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:58,046
the exam prep already in your pocket. I want to show you how

6
00:01:58,068 --> 00:02:01,566
I adopted this belief to an actual proactive approach that you

7
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,158
could take that will help you manage incidents more efficiently, in a

8
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:09,426
more structured way and eventually preserve much needed hours of sleep.

9
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:13,586
So first of all, hi, my name is Hila Fish. I'm a senior DevOps engineer

10
00:02:13,618 --> 00:02:17,206
and I work for weeks. I have 15 years of experience in the tech

11
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,986
industry, which means a lot of production incidents. Recently I have

12
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,820
joined the AWS Community Builders program.

13
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,118
I live in Israel and I help organize events,

14
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:32,394
DevOps events like DevOps Days Tel Aviv and Statcraft monitoring

15
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:35,850
conference. I'm a mentor in courses and communities,

16
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,674
including communities for women in tech, specifically technical

17
00:02:39,722 --> 00:02:43,566
women in tech. I'm a DevOps culture fan. I think this is what helps companies

18
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:47,458
achieve great things. And I'm a lead singer in a cover band, as you

19
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:51,122
can see in this picture, which is a lot of fun. Okay, so today,

20
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:54,610
what are we going to cover today? Incidents management

21
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,806
in general. The necessary flow for me,

22
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:02,166
the structural flow to take the mindset that you

23
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:05,890
should have while dealing with production incidents.

24
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,274
And how can you be proactive and come prepared for

25
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:12,506
incidents. So let's start. So, first of

26
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:16,134
all, incident management is a set of procedures and actions

27
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:19,766
taken to resolve critical incidents. And it's

28
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:23,086
basically an end to end process that defines how incidents are

29
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:26,974
detected and communicated, who is responsible to handle them,

30
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:30,858
what tools are used for investigation and response, and what steps

31
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:34,674
are taken for resolution. And the

32
00:03:34,712 --> 00:03:38,450
thing were with incidents is that we need

33
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,098
to reframe our perspective. Because walking enough years in

34
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:45,446
the industry, we know that everything fails, right? All the

35
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:49,254
time. So since failures are given, we can't be in an ad

36
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,994
hoc putting out fires mindset. We need to refrain

37
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:56,374
the mindset to be structured and

38
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:59,706
say that, okay, we know that this

39
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:02,986
is going to happen, but at least I'm prepared to deal with

40
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:06,982
it. So business mindset is needed to grasp

41
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:10,386
the overall impact of incidents and mitigate damages.

42
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:13,680
Because without incident management, structured process,

43
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,946
or even without handling it properly

44
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,562
in general, then we could potentially lose valuable

45
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:25,694
data. Downtime could lead to reduced production

46
00:04:25,742 --> 00:04:29,566
and revenues, and the business could be held liable for breach

47
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:32,962
of service level agreements. Because as we know, each business

48
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:36,158
has its own sls defined eight nines, eleven nine.

49
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:40,470
So it's very important to treat incident management with all seriousness.

50
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,170
So that's why we need to reframe our perspective,

51
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,222
have a business mindset and have the incident management

52
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:52,586
be a structured process because a

53
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:56,374
structured process can lead to incidents production,

54
00:04:56,502 --> 00:05:00,522
improved, meantime to resolution and eventually to cost reduction

55
00:05:00,586 --> 00:05:04,350
since downtime was reduced or eliminated entirely.

56
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,658
So wait, a structured process of an incident,

57
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:10,890
but how could it be? We have a lot of unknowns.

58
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,802
Sometimes it's incident x from that reason, sometimes it's that.

59
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,766
So how can it be structured if it's not consistent?

60
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:22,594
So years it youll be a structured process so there are

61
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:25,590
pillars that you can follow through.

62
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,162
I'm going to cover each one of them, identification and categorization,

63
00:05:30,306 --> 00:05:33,634
notification and escalation, investigation and diagnosis,

64
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:37,302
resolve and recovery and eventually incident close.

65
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:41,034
And what you should do then. And I also put

66
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:44,874
some reference link here for an article by

67
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:48,202
on page. You can deep dive about these pillars later

68
00:05:48,256 --> 00:05:51,806
on. Okay. So during an incident you should really

69
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:55,118
keep calm and ask yourselves, and I'm also going to address

70
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:58,734
the keep calm further on

71
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:02,522
in the presentation. So you should really ask yourselves

72
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:07,214
these questions. First of all, in the identification and categorization

73
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:11,330
pillar, do I understand the full extent of the problem? If so,

74
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,706
awesome. I can ive right in and notify people if

75
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:17,798
I need to. Because sometimes if it's a

76
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:21,702
crucial issue, I know that I need to update person x or

77
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:26,354
even customer success to alert users

78
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:29,638
that the application is down or not.

79
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:33,706
Depends on the issue and the full extent of it. And if I don't know

80
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:37,530
or don't understand the full extent of the problem, then I should gather more information

81
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,938
that will help you, help youll help me

82
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,598
understand what's going on and what needed steps I

83
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:48,414
needed to do based on that. Next up is can

84
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:52,126
this wait and be handled in business hours? Because maybe you

85
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:56,066
got paged by 04:00 a.m. But maybe it's not that important

86
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:59,886
and the alert is falsely labeled

87
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,598
as critical. But it's actually not critical, it's minor.

88
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:07,334
So we should address that. And if we're not

89
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:10,582
sure if this can wait for business hours

90
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:14,166
or not, we should really ask and we use

91
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:18,470
the information that we gathered in order to understand that and escalate

92
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,314
if we need to. And also if

93
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:26,182
we saw that the incident is not really critical, it's minor,

94
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:30,330
we should really change the severity or the runbook accordingly.

95
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,910
And also another thing that we need to check is that

96
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,622
was I notified about this alert or this issue

97
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:41,870
from the proper or expected channels? Because if so,

98
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,630
awesome. And if not, maybe I need to not. Maybe I should add

99
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,994
note to self to fix that, because if I heard about an issue from

100
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:52,878
a user complaint and not from petrol duty or obstining

101
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:56,200
or stuff like that, then we should really handle that.

102
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,086
Next pillar is notification and escalation. So who should

103
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:04,182
be notified about this incidents? Here we have two routes during

104
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:07,990
an incident and in general. So during the incident

105
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,882
you should decide by incident importance. Because again,

106
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:15,066
if it's critical, if the application is down and affects a lot of

107
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:19,174
users, then we should alert the support or the customer success teams

108
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:22,438
to communicate to customers if need be.

109
00:08:22,624 --> 00:08:26,298
And in general, maybe there are other teams or key focal

110
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:30,126
points that care about the system and we need to keep them posted about the

111
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:33,646
system's health and status. The next pillar

112
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:38,190
is investigation and diagnosis. So what information is relevant

113
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,242
toward incident resolution? Because we should really focus

114
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:45,782
on what's important and what's relevant and put the

115
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:49,234
unimportant stuff aside because focusing

116
00:08:49,282 --> 00:08:53,014
on the non relevant information will throw you off route and

117
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:56,502
make you lose valuable time. When youll deal with

118
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,298
an incident, doesn't matter if it's during business hours or not,

119
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:04,874
it will lose you valuable time. So you should really focus on what's important

120
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:08,266
right now. Did I find the

121
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:11,354
root cause? Do I understand the root cause of the issue?

122
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:15,070
If so, awesome. I can progress according to that.

123
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,414
But if not, I should investigate more. And if

124
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:22,510
I see it takes a lot of time, I should really escalate to

125
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,034
other team members or team leaders or other teams to help

126
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:29,358
me understand the root cause. Because we don't want to lose

127
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:32,594
valuable time and have the system in

128
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:36,550
downtime. If I could prevent that by just asking for help.

129
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,070
Right? And also we should really prioritize root cause

130
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,320
over surface level symptoms because let's say

131
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,270
I got an alert service is down on

132
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,230
silver x. Okay, I started it. Nice.

133
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,166
Then it happens again. And then it happens again. And then I shouldn't

134
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:57,418
just start the service and go back to sleep or just continue

135
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:01,066
with my day. If it happens. I need to check what's going

136
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:04,922
on, right? I need to check the root cause of why the service got stopped

137
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:08,414
and what's going on. Because our focus is

138
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:11,806
the environment, the system's health. So we need to make sure

139
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:15,442
that we know what's going on and not just fix, not really

140
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:19,474
fix, but put a band aid over

141
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:23,326
the scenario. And the last pillar is resolve

142
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:26,706
and recovery. So which possible remediation step is

143
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:30,406
the best one to take? Maybe I found the issue. Maybe there are

144
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:33,622
a lot of stuff I can do about it right?

145
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:37,506
So the thing is that you should choose the fastest

146
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:41,414
solution to eliminate downtime without compromising

147
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:43,820
the system's health and stability. Because, yeah,

148
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,690
we all want to go back to sleep when something happens because

149
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,546
we care a lot about our quality of sleep,

150
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:55,182
but in this point of time, we should really care

151
00:10:55,236 --> 00:10:59,246
more about the system's health. So we should do whatever

152
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:02,914
is good for the system's health because it will

153
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:06,290
bite us in the if we don't.

154
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,038
And this is what were here for, right? We are either DevOps

155
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,670
engineers or sres. What is SRE? Site reliability

156
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,390
engineer. If I don't care about or don't take care of the site

157
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,120
reliability, I'm not really doing my job.

158
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,294
So there's that. Next up is are

159
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:29,674
there any action items needed after the issue got

160
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:33,082
resolved? Maybe it was the middle

161
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:37,354
of the night and there was really time to

162
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:41,018
go to the developer's code and wix the

163
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:44,302
issue properly. So maybe there was a patch done.

164
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:47,886
Okay, if there was a patch done and management knows about it,

165
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:51,262
everyone knows about it and agreed that it should be done. At that

166
00:11:51,316 --> 00:11:54,570
point, all good, but we should permanently

167
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,274
fix the issue because again, we want to, a, prevent a

168
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:02,498
recurring issue and b, we want to make sure the system health is

169
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:06,318
good. And if it's just a patch and not a permanent solution,

170
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:09,400
then probably the system health is not that great.

171
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,762
And last but not least is closure. So once the incident

172
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:18,630
got resolved, do I need to notify anyone on this incidents resolution?

173
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,014
We need to be end to end communicator. So if at the beginning we alerted

174
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:26,154
customer success or support teams that there's an issue,

175
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:29,386
we now need to tell them, okay, issue got resolved. Please make

176
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:33,082
sure that, a, you communicate it to the users and b,

177
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:36,650
let us know. Maybe we think the issue got resolved,

178
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,790
but something happens and they still experience issues.

179
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,106
Right. So they are our QA of

180
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:46,962
some sort to make sure that everything works okay.

181
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:50,866
But they also need to communicate the users that now

182
00:12:50,968 --> 00:12:55,294
the system should be back to normal. Were alerts

183
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:59,206
okay. Or they need tweaking because as I said, maybe we

184
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:02,370
got an alert in the middle of the night and it's not that critical.

185
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,326
We need to fix the alerts and tweak it. So we should do

186
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:09,786
that. Is a relevant incident runbook in place?

187
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:13,702
If it's outdated, maybe it needs to be updated.

188
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:17,674
Right. So runbooks are things that

189
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:21,458
we have during an incident or should have during an incident that helps

190
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:25,050
us resolve an issue usually, or mostly

191
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,082
when we need to have comes sort of judgment on an incident.

192
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:32,542
So let's say, if this happens, I need to do this,

193
00:13:32,596 --> 00:13:36,046
but unless the other log shows x, and then I need

194
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:39,534
to do that, right? So there are a lot of things and scenarios

195
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:43,566
where judgment is needed. In that case, we should really have runbooks

196
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:47,170
in place. If we don't have runbooks in place, please,

197
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,026
we all need to write them down. And even if we do have runbooks

198
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:53,766
in place, we need to update them to make sure that they are up to

199
00:13:53,788 --> 00:13:57,634
date. Could I help prevent

200
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:01,058
similar incidents from happening again? Maybe I noticed something that could

201
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:04,346
be tweaked or changed or fixed or edited in order to

202
00:14:04,368 --> 00:14:07,418
prevent similar incidents from happening. If so, create a

203
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:10,838
task for you in Jira or Monday or whatever tool that you use,

204
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:14,480
and help prevent the next incident from happening.

205
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,226
And also, of course, does this incidents require a postmortem

206
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:22,894
if years, then okay, jot down the notes as soon as possible while

207
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:26,674
it's still fresh in your mind. Because I think we all

208
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:29,810
know that we are human beings and we remember

209
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,650
things better once it's still happening, and not like after

210
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,606
an hour or two or even the next day. But just to

211
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,426
make an emphasis on that, were was a study conducted by Blumar

212
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:45,558
Zeigonik, who's a russian psychologist. She found, but that we

213
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:49,314
remember more details during an ongoing scenario rather than upon

214
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:52,966
their completion. So, in favor of a

215
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:57,194
better post mortem process, write the notes down as soon as possible.

216
00:14:57,392 --> 00:15:00,998
And if there isn't a need for postmortem,

217
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:04,606
still share the knowledge, either through a runbook or

218
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:08,078
a daily brief, or even do a mental check with yourself to

219
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:11,406
make sure that everything was handled as smoothly as

220
00:15:11,428 --> 00:15:14,100
possible. And if not, what could be done better?

221
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,174
Okay, let's talk a bit about war room conduct.

222
00:15:18,222 --> 00:15:22,194
So, war room is when you have, I would say, more than

223
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:25,810
three, four people handling

224
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,702
an issue, right? So in that case, we should really

225
00:15:29,756 --> 00:15:33,478
have an incident manager that really

226
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:37,334
divides the work and tell people what to do. This person should be

227
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:41,318
calm and collected and see things clearly

228
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:45,542
and not afraid to reduce people's involvement if it doesn't serve the purpose.

229
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:49,322
Because if, let's say we call this guy to help

230
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:53,050
with a certain thing now, this certain thing finished.

231
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,906
Okay, now, guy, please go away. Because we don't

232
00:15:56,938 --> 00:16:00,842
need the extra noise, because too many people can be too noisy.

233
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:03,674
It should be kept minimal and dynamic.

234
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:07,106
And there's that. And I want to tell you even a story about

235
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:10,398
that. On one of my previous jobs,

236
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:14,510
I was new at the company, and there was a critical

237
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,214
AWS issue that created a lot of bad stuff

238
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:21,734
for us downtime not good stuff. And I was

239
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,526
new, right? So I didn't speak up because I didn't think that

240
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:28,642
I have something to contribute because I don't know anything yet.

241
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:32,394
I'm new, but I was, were in the war

242
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:36,282
room like it was on Zoom. So I was just there quietly and

243
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:40,034
I saw that they are just going places

244
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:43,594
that are not really helpful. He pulls

245
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:47,534
this rope like this way and

246
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:51,360
he thinks about that and he talks about that and everyone just

247
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,714
doing their own thing and not really coming together. So at that point

248
00:16:55,752 --> 00:16:58,786
of time, I jumped the gun and said, guys,

249
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:02,130
I don't see that this is coming or going anywhere.

250
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,526
Let me help. And then I took the liberty to be the

251
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:11,254
incident manager. And then I told this guy, okay,

252
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:15,030
you check the logs, check x. I don't see that we have

253
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,618
a runbook for a proper startup of

254
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:22,234
the application to see the flow that needed

255
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:26,282
to be in a specified order. So please write down

256
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:30,140
the process for us to start the application

257
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,662
in the order that is needed. Right. So I took this

258
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:39,502
role upon me and then stuff started to really

259
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:42,894
progress towards resolution. So incident manager is

260
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:45,986
very needed in a war room conduct because we

261
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:49,362
need to have organized way of doing

262
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,562
things, as always. Okay. And speaking

263
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:56,450
of an incidents manager, there are a lot of things that you should

264
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,800
have qualities that you should have when

265
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,182
you handle an incident. It doesn't matter if it's in a war room or

266
00:18:04,236 --> 00:18:07,798
on your own, but there are a lot of qualities. Of course there are a

267
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:11,594
lot. I'm not going to tell everything here

268
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:15,738
or mention everyone because I can't mention all qualities, but let's cover

269
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:19,174
the ones that I think that are important and some tips

270
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:22,830
for me how to perfect them. So the first one is

271
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,394
think on your feet impromptu action

272
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:30,254
taker. So sometimes the

273
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,838
issue will be something that youll are familiar with it, but sometimes it

274
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:37,346
will be something in an uncharted territory. And you need to think on

275
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:41,234
your feet and be ready for anything. And in order to practice that,

276
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:44,210
you can participate in brainstorming sessions at work.

277
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,986
So whenever possible, you can jump the gun and participate

278
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:51,554
these sessions because these kind of scenarios of ping pong

279
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:54,600
will help you practice this quality.

280
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,126
Next one is differentiate between relevant and non relevant

281
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:02,794
information. As I just mentioned before in the

282
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:06,602
war room story, he said that,

283
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:09,802
he said that. And people talked and talked and talked.

284
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,406
I'm like, guys, we don't progress towards resolution. We need

285
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,526
to really focus on what matters right now.

286
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:20,302
So that's very important trait to have

287
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:23,646
to differentiate between what's important for fixing

288
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:27,266
the issue and what's not. And basically, the more

289
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:30,750
youll know how a system works, the more your ability

290
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,770
to separate the relevant from the non relevant information increases

291
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,174
operation under pressure. So let me also

292
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:42,502
tell you a story on another job

293
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,874
that I was there, I joined.

294
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:49,194
I also was new at that position as well. And I

295
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:51,180
had my first on call.

296
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,706
My first on call were, I forgot the word, my first uncle. And there

297
00:19:57,728 --> 00:20:00,938
was a big issue. I mean, a lot of alerts on the screen.

298
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:04,506
Like 100 alerts. It was crazy.

299
00:20:04,688 --> 00:20:08,046
And then I looked at the screen, I'm like, okay, I'm new. I don't know

300
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:11,758
what to do yet. Let's call the guy that's there for two years,

301
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:14,830
and he will help me, right? Because he knows what to do.

302
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,626
He's familiar with what's going on there. So I called him, and then

303
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:22,306
he sat next to me, and I'm like, okay, now what do we need to

304
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:26,120
do? And then I remember he just looked at the screen. He was like,

305
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,642
wow, there are so many alerts.

306
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:34,120
And I'm like, dude, dude, snap out of it.

307
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,682
So he was totally out of it. And I'm like,

308
00:20:38,736 --> 00:20:42,326
guy, dude, it's not helpful.

309
00:20:42,518 --> 00:20:46,218
We need to snap out of it and see what we can do

310
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:49,418
to fix that. Right? And the thing is that

311
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:53,434
stress is a symptom of being out of control, and collection

312
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:57,034
of relevant data will help you decrease stress

313
00:20:57,082 --> 00:21:00,254
levels. So when you know what to do, you're in control.

314
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:03,106
And in general, you should really keep a cool head.

315
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,626
Snap out of the uncertainty cloudiness, because when

316
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:09,330
it comes to multiple participant incidents,

317
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,098
it's also something that you should think about, that the

318
00:21:14,184 --> 00:21:17,718
stress level increases because everyone stressed and they want

319
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:21,382
to fix the issue, right? So keep a cool head and

320
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:24,886
just start to gather information that will help you

321
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:28,520
solve the issue and then regain your control.

322
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,562
A methodical work. So time

323
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:37,002
is of the essence, right? And there is a pressure to solve things fast,

324
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:40,598
as I just mentioned in the previous bullet.

325
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:44,282
But the thing is that methodical walk will help you gain faster

326
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:47,680
incident resolution. As I showed you before, structured process,

327
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,866
follow the rules, follow the questions that you need to ask yourselves,

328
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:57,742
and then it will help you regain control and progress

329
00:21:57,806 --> 00:22:01,774
you towards faster incident resolution. Be humble.

330
00:22:01,902 --> 00:22:05,378
If you're stuck, ask for help. So it's okay not to

331
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:08,360
know how to fix an issue on your own. That's okay.

332
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,834
But you need to understand that it's not your time to shine.

333
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:16,386
People say, I will fix the issue. I will be the hero,

334
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:20,474
and that's that. But no, your time to shine will be if

335
00:22:20,512 --> 00:22:24,054
you help the company not lose

336
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:27,274
money and not have downtime, right. So you will have a lot of

337
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:31,286
opportunities to prove yourself on your day to day. The best way to prove

338
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:35,134
yourself on instance is to take a step back and escalate an

339
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:38,478
issue. If you don't know what to do and you can't resolve it on

340
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:42,190
your own, because in that way you have the business interest in health.

341
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,980
Remember business mindset, it's exactly that.

342
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,662
Problem solver. So if you have a problem solver approach,

343
00:22:49,726 --> 00:22:54,100
whatever needed and can do approach, youll can basically do anything because

344
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,000
being positive is the way to go. And if you start from that

345
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,454
point and not be negative of like,

346
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:06,086
I'm not sure it can be salvageable or whatever,

347
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:10,022
it means that your ability to do stuff increases.

348
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:14,138
So always have a positive can do approach, sense of

349
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:18,266
ownership and initiative. So if

350
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:22,538
you're on call and you escalated something to other person, that's good,

351
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:26,494
right? We just talked about it, but you are still on call. It means

352
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:30,126
that if you escalated something, you're still responsible and you

353
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:33,134
need to have end to end handling of things.

354
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:36,826
So after escalation, wait ten minutes,

355
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:40,674
15 minutes, whatever it takes, and then ask, hey, what's going on? Do you need

356
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:44,626
help? Do you know what to do? And be sure that you know

357
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:48,646
what's going on and it's really handled because maybe you escalated. But the

358
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:52,626
other person, I don't know, he didn't understand it correctly

359
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:56,374
and he's not really handling it, and nobody's handling the issue right now.

360
00:23:56,412 --> 00:24:00,438
So communication is very important. And make sure that if you escalated,

361
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:04,570
this is really handling, someone is really handling it,

362
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,780
and it's an end to end process for that

363
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,598
good communicator. So you really need to explain

364
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:17,454
the issue to others that will help you and communicate the issue

365
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:21,086
for escalation purposes. So being a good communicator is very

366
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:25,566
important and communication guidelines can be established.

367
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:29,474
So let's say you're not good in communication, you're not great with

368
00:24:29,512 --> 00:24:33,106
that, you don't know who to talk to, or you

369
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:37,062
don't have the tendency of updating people, right? So if

370
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:40,834
your company or your department sets communication guidelines,

371
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:44,694
then you will know exactly what channels should be used and what

372
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:48,274
content is expected in those channels and how communication

373
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:52,422
should be documented. And if you have this laid

374
00:24:52,486 --> 00:24:55,866
all out for you, then you know exactly what should be communicated and

375
00:24:55,888 --> 00:24:59,562
it will help youll be a better communicator and lead

376
00:24:59,616 --> 00:25:03,694
without authority. It's mostly relevant on a war

377
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:07,690
room scenario with more than two people involved.

378
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,566
And remember that if you're nice and confident and you

379
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:15,314
make people feel at ease and project and everything under

380
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:18,674
control facade, then people will listen to you and follow your

381
00:25:18,712 --> 00:25:23,106
lead. And I think that the most important thing is

382
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,774
caring. You need to care about what's going on. You need to care

383
00:25:26,812 --> 00:25:30,454
about production. You need to care about your team

384
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:34,546
members, your company. If you care, then you will do the extra mile

385
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:38,166
and you will be able to do anything that

386
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:41,898
I mentioned here. And the structure process, and also the proactive approach that

387
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:45,482
I'm being to show you right now. Okay, so we

388
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:49,658
covered the mindset that you should have the business mindset when working

389
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:53,834
on production and handling production incidents. We covered

390
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:57,710
an incident flow, a structured one that will help you handle

391
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,882
an incident better. Now let's talk about being proactive.

392
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:05,534
The proactive approach that you should have in order

393
00:26:05,572 --> 00:26:10,786
to come prepared for an incident that will happen. Because as

394
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:14,306
the song by the Fujis. Right? Ready or not, here I

395
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:17,782
come. You can hide. So if you're not ready,

396
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:22,166
it doesn't matter. Page of duty or opgeny or victorops or whatever

397
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:26,374
tool that you use will call you anyway when you're on

398
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:30,074
call. So you better be ready. So how can we be

399
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:33,386
ready? Right? The proactive approach after the fact, after an

400
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:37,366
incident took place, looks something like that, in my opinion.

401
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:41,086
So first of all, on call shifts handoffs, I'm not

402
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:44,830
sure if it's something that is done on every company,

403
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,526
but let's say I finished the shift. By the way,

404
00:26:48,548 --> 00:26:52,640
this is the word that I looked for before

405
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,410
on call shift. So after an on call shift,

406
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,930
there were several issues. If they were minor, then okay,

407
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,350
but if there was something special or something recurring,

408
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,198
I should document it in an on call shift handoff, which is

409
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:12,614
a summary that I will post in my team's channel.

410
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:16,326
And then the uncle after me can read what's going on,

411
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:19,510
and that way he or she or they can be updated

412
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,354
on what's going on in production. And it will help them

413
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:26,860
have a better shift on their own because if they will have

414
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:31,126
an issue, and the issue was basically recalling

415
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:34,846
because I had it, then they would know better how to handle that.

416
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:39,114
So it's good for audit purposes because it is documented

417
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:42,766
in the Slack channel, but it's also good for your team

418
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:46,530
member success because you want to help them do their job better and have

419
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,450
a smoother shift.

420
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,306
Postmortem notes. So as I mentioned before, write them down as

421
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:57,618
soon as possible. And even if there's no meeting,

422
00:27:57,794 --> 00:28:01,606
do a mental check. Do a retro with yourself, see what you

423
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:05,410
could have done better new tasks.

424
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,334
So again, prevent the next incidents. Do you have

425
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:12,822
something in mind that could help, based on what you saw in the incident

426
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,798
that could help stabilize the environment?

427
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:19,686
Open a jira or a Monday ticket and fix it to prevent

428
00:28:19,718 --> 00:28:24,334
the next incident? Modify alerts so maybe you

429
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:27,566
saw some false positive alerts, and I think we

430
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:31,518
all seen it in our career, alerts that come up and after

431
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:35,182
a couple of minutes get closed. So don't just leave that,

432
00:28:35,236 --> 00:28:38,466
right? And don't just wait for the next on call to

433
00:28:38,488 --> 00:28:41,746
fix the alerts because maybe they will wait for the next on call and they

434
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:44,942
will wait for the next on call and then it will never get

435
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:48,786
happen and we all will suffer from these alerts.

436
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:52,086
So please fix them. Internet runbooks so

437
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:56,178
I mentioned it before, if you don't have Internet runbooks

438
00:28:56,194 --> 00:29:00,166
in place, please write them down and update

439
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:04,106
them along the way. And this will help you to have a

440
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:08,186
smoother process, right. Because you are already prepared, you know what to do in

441
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,640
a certain scenario than certain issues.

442
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,762
Automation. Let's say you found some candidates

443
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:18,942
for self remediation, some issues that could be self

444
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:22,398
remediate by the process or the flow itself.

445
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:25,700
So if so, open a ticket and make it happen.

446
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:30,466
And if the issue handled, share the knowledge. I mean, people could really

447
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:33,762
benefit from your line of thought and how you fix things.

448
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:37,334
And this share of knowledge is more in depth than in an on

449
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:41,254
call handoff, because in an on call handoff, you just write

450
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:45,010
down a summary, were, I mean, actual share of knowledge

451
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,106
to show people how you figured out things. What was

452
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:52,890
your line of thought? What was the flow that you had? It will really help

453
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,620
others understand what's going on and come prepared better

454
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,726
for incidents. So we covered the proactive approach

455
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,606
for after the fact, after an incident took place. Now let's discuss

456
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:08,506
what youll can do on your day to day that will help you come prepared

457
00:30:08,538 --> 00:30:12,298
for incidents. So, first of all, the onco shifts,

458
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:16,130
handoffs that I mentioned before, you should read everything, okay?

459
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,318
Not only the shifts that the handoffs

460
00:30:20,334 --> 00:30:23,694
that the person after you wrote,

461
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,234
but your entire team, it shouldn't take long. It just should

462
00:30:27,272 --> 00:30:30,550
be like a paragraph. And this could help you understand

463
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,310
what's going on in production when you're not there, when you didn't do the changes

464
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,114
yourself. So it's very important because that way you will always be

465
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,970
up to date with what's going on in production.

466
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,098
Escalation, a point of contact. So you support

467
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:48,394
several services at work, right? And you know the

468
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:52,970
needed pieces of information related to your realm. My realm is infrastructure,

469
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,558
so that's great, but you should also know

470
00:30:56,644 --> 00:30:59,950
other realms as well to have the full picture. So let's say

471
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,502
there's an issue with X. I've checked my side of things,

472
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:06,946
I don't see any issue, but I know that John is the one

473
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:10,178
that is handling X from the side of code, from the

474
00:31:10,184 --> 00:31:13,762
side of the developer side. So I should escalate to him to check things

475
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:17,202
on his end. Identifying services, escalation points

476
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:20,670
on a day to day basis, and not only ad hoc

477
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,454
when the occurs will save time and money

478
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:28,274
on incident management and save someone else's hours of sleep.

479
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:31,994
Right? Because if I don't know who's handling a developer side

480
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:35,338
of service x, then I need to wake my team member. I need to

481
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:38,678
wake my team leader and ask, hey, who's responsible

482
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:41,946
for that, right? So not nice. So I

483
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:45,806
can prevent that and already come prepared and know that these services are

484
00:31:45,828 --> 00:31:49,022
handled by these guys or these women or whatever.

485
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:52,426
And then it will save time for me during

486
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:56,130
the incident. And other than just

487
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,270
chasing my tail and figuring this out on the spot,

488
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,790
I know exactly who can I escalate the incident

489
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,006
to. Understanding system architecture. So if

490
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:11,446
I know weaker areas in the infrastructure or

491
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:15,206
in the code maybe, and vulnerabilities and sensitive or

492
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:20,410
blast radio scopes, then to help me understand the

493
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,330
severities of incident, to help me understand what

494
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,358
needs to be done, either escalation or root cause analysis.

495
00:32:28,454 --> 00:32:32,462
So understanding and really learning how our

496
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:36,350
infrastructure works and its vulnerabilities will really

497
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,710
help us come prepared for any incidents.

498
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,174
And coupled with that is learning application flows, because that

499
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,842
way we know the business impact. If something bad

500
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:51,522
happens, we have a service, we know if this is a service

501
00:32:51,656 --> 00:32:55,294
that affects a lot of users or maybe a few. So business impact

502
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:58,802
is very important in that case and also for escalation purposes.

503
00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:02,694
If I know application flows, I know that this service communicates with this and

504
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:06,294
goes to this and goes to that, then I can do

505
00:33:06,332 --> 00:33:09,334
a root cause analysis and go by the flow and see,

506
00:33:09,372 --> 00:33:13,002
okay, these logs looks okay here. It's okay.

507
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:16,826
Oh, were I have some issues, if I don't know the flow, I wouldn't be

508
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:20,766
able to go in this path. So learning application flows is very,

509
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:24,446
very important. Team members tasks. So as we

510
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:27,774
know, production happens not only by me or by

511
00:33:27,812 --> 00:33:32,074
you, but your team members also contribute

512
00:33:32,202 --> 00:33:35,460
to the production changes that happened.

513
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:40,818
And believe me, it really is easy for me to just lay low

514
00:33:40,904 --> 00:33:44,366
and deal only with my tasks. But I'm responsible

515
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,794
for production. I need to know what's going on so I need to know what

516
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:51,446
my other team members are doing and what changes they introduce to the

517
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:55,094
environment. Because I'm responsible for the environment and I need to know what's going

518
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:58,842
on. So it's very important. And again,

519
00:33:58,896 --> 00:34:02,570
coupled with that deployments or changes in production,

520
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,998
so ask about the changes and their possible impact.

521
00:34:07,094 --> 00:34:11,046
And as I said before, the previous slide ops

522
00:34:11,078 --> 00:34:14,350
genie or pagerduty doesn't care if you didn't do the

523
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,366
deployments or the changes by yourself. It will call you anyway if

524
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:22,286
you're on call. So you better understand and know what happened

525
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:26,370
in production in order to handle incidents better.

526
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,034
And last but not least, be a go to person

527
00:34:30,232 --> 00:34:33,314
as they say. If you build it, they will come.

528
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:37,414
If you are a person that is known to

529
00:34:37,532 --> 00:34:40,726
be proactive and know what's going on in the

530
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:44,626
system, people will come to you. Youll get push notifications

531
00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:48,822
and it will decrease your need to fetch the updates on your own because people

532
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:51,930
will come to you. So there's that.

533
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,514
And I say that in order to talk the talk

534
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:59,590
and walk the walk when it comes to incidents management, if you have your qualities

535
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,310
in check, so if you know that you're going to be stressed out,

536
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,134
work on that and other what is

537
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:13,070
in check, make the process structured and place.

538
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:18,356
Then prevent

539
00:35:18,388 --> 00:35:22,340
the next incident from happening. And remember, less incidents

540
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,328
means less downtime means business success and business success

541
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:29,760
is eventually your success. So thank you so much.

542
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,104
If you have any questions about incidents management or

543
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:36,816
any other SRE topics, I will be more than happy to help. Thank you

544
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:37,070
so much.
