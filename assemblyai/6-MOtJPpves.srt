00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,654
Hello everyone. My name is Humaira Ahmed. I'm the founder and

2
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:35,910
CEO of locale which is a mentorship platform

3
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,894
created for women in the workplace. We focus on one

4
00:00:39,932 --> 00:00:43,606
to one matching with industry leaders for mentorship as

5
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:47,446
well as guidance on the go. I'm so honored to be here in

6
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:50,894
the company of incredible people like like yourself.

7
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,918
And today I want to talk about a topic that is near and dear to

8
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:56,862
all of us, that impacts us every single day.

9
00:00:56,996 --> 00:01:00,702
It's the topic of fear. While fear has many different

10
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:04,894
forms, it's a broad topic and I want to focus on two

11
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,466
types of fear today. One is a fear of

12
00:01:08,488 --> 00:01:12,354
failure. It's the fear of losing, the fear of rejection and

13
00:01:12,392 --> 00:01:15,986
fear of not being good enough. And we all feel that.

14
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,826
And there is the other type of fear that I believe is worth fearing.

15
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:23,814
It is the fear of regret. Because it's the fear of regret that

16
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:27,218
drives us forward, unlike the fear of failure

17
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,938
that holds us back. So let me put this into perspective for you.

18
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,234
I'll share three of my life stories to give you more

19
00:01:34,272 --> 00:01:38,778
insight and to help you really understand the difference.

20
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:42,566
Story number one, I was born and raised in Pakistan and my family moved

21
00:01:42,598 --> 00:01:46,206
to Canada 15 years ago. So I moved at the age of

22
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:49,486
20. In case you're wondering. I don't know how

23
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:53,050
much you know about Pakistan, but it's a very male dominated,

24
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,514
mostly suppressive society towards women. Growing up,

25
00:01:56,632 --> 00:02:00,210
I was always told what I could do, who I could be,

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,094
what I couldn't do, who I couldn't be, and most importantly,

27
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:07,478
and unfortunately, who I would marry. And at

28
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:11,298
the age of 15, I was engaged to a man twelve years older

29
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:15,142
than me, almost twice my age. And guess what?

30
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:18,790
I hadn't even seen him. I also want to highlight something here

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,486
that in Pakistan, engagements are as serious as marriages.

32
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:25,706
It's the status quo. And although I hadn't seen the

33
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,050
guy and he was twice my age, what mattered the most

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,506
was that he was educated, he had a great job and he had

35
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:36,110
money. All the key ingredients that parents look for.

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,006
There was no consent on my end and I was told there was nothing I

37
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:42,426
could do to get away from all of this because parents

38
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:46,218
know best. On the one hand, I had fear of disappointing

39
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:49,346
my parents. I was always on a vegan girl, wanted to

40
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:52,834
make my parents happy. But on the other hand, I could also see my life

41
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,174
being thrown away. It wasn't what I wanted. I had dreams,

42
00:02:56,302 --> 00:03:00,086
I had goals like all of you. And I had

43
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:04,166
ambitions. And I knew that this marriage would take it all away.

44
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:07,990
There was only one thing that I could do. And I'm going to tell you

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,018
that it's going to sound lame, but that's the only thing I could do.

46
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,538
And I did. And it was to cry. I would cry every single

47
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:17,882
night. Go to my mom, tell her how

48
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:21,146
much I didn't want to be married and I wanted to do big things in

49
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,606
my life. And she would tell me to go study. This was going to

50
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:27,806
happen. We are your parents and we have decided for you

51
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:32,190
we know best. But two months before the wedding, something happened.

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,694
I became really, really sick. I was so sick that I couldn't eat,

53
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:39,170
I couldn't walk. And the doctors couldn't really find out what was going on.

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,702
Until one day, one of the doctors diagnosed me with acute depression.

55
00:03:42,766 --> 00:03:46,146
At 15, I was depressed. The medicine I got

56
00:03:46,248 --> 00:03:49,462
was for depression. And it started to work. After weeks,

57
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,914
I became better. And then, guess what? The marriage

58
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:56,610
was happening again. Back on track. But one month before the wedding,

59
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,374
my fiance called up my dad and he told him that after four

60
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:03,974
years of trying, he finally received his h one visa

61
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:07,386
to go to the USA to work. He was so excited. And he gave my

62
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:10,554
parents two options. He said, well, he really

63
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:14,046
wanted to take on this opportunity. He had worked really hard for

64
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:17,646
it. And he said one option is that we get married in

65
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:20,830
the next ten days and he goes to us while I stay with

66
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,446
his family for three years in his aim and wait for him to

67
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:28,322
come back and he'll take me with him to us. The other option,

68
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:31,794
equally charming, was that I wait for the next three years

69
00:04:31,832 --> 00:04:34,946
until he returned and know we could get married. So all

70
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:38,914
this time, either way, I was supposed to be tied

71
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:42,482
to him. And then, remember I told you that engagements

72
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:46,098
were has serious as marriages. His parents thought the same thing. They didn't

73
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:49,546
think anything would happen. I mean, negative. My dad, on the other

74
00:04:49,568 --> 00:04:52,874
hand, was furious. He knew that I

75
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:56,442
didn't want this marriage. He saw me cry every night.

76
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:59,626
He told a guy in that moment that

77
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:03,686
it was over. Nobody could believe it, but he said it was over because

78
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:07,134
my daughter is not a burden on me. And by the way, she's not even

79
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:11,290
happy with this marriage. And the options you've proposed are unacceptable.

80
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,486
So this engagement is over. That's how I escaped my first engagement.

81
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:19,586
And the lesson that I learned from this is that you never know.

82
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:23,246
On the one hand, I did have this fear of disappointing

83
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:26,382
my parents. A failure. But the bigger fear

84
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,054
was the fear of regret. I did the only thing I could

85
00:05:30,092 --> 00:05:33,366
do. And little by little, my tears had an impact on my

86
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:36,710
body, on my family, and in the end, it all worked out.

87
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,258
So listen to your body, listen to your gut. When something doesn't

88
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,954
feel right, it probably isn't. Story number two.

89
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:46,634
Roughly a year later, guess what happened? I was engaged again.

90
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:50,106
This time I had seen the guy and I can tell you did

91
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:53,598
not like what I saw. But you know what, he was also, by the

92
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:57,162
way, twelve years older. That's the theme here. But he had all the key ingredients

93
00:05:57,226 --> 00:06:00,382
that parents look for. He was educated, had a job,

94
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:04,318
had money. This time. I mean, I'm seasoned here. I've done this before.

95
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:07,938
I did my crying again, but I knew it wasn't going to

96
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:11,906
be enough this time. So I applied to the best schools and I knew that

97
00:06:11,928 --> 00:06:15,598
if I got into the best school for engineering,

98
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:18,978
I could negotiate with my parents. I was really determined to make my

99
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:22,326
dreams into a reality. And I did get into one

100
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,274
of the best schools for software engineering in Pakistan. And my parents

101
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:29,590
were so proud. In that moment of pride, my mom

102
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,226
called up my fiance's mom and she told her that I got into

103
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:36,998
the best school for software engineering and that she'll go to school soon. My fiance's

104
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:40,282
mom hung up and called back after half an hour and I was

105
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:43,610
sitting right there with her, with my mom, and this is what she said.

106
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,034
So I've spoken to my son and he's basically said that Shemera

107
00:06:47,082 --> 00:06:49,982
is not going to go to school. She's not going to go to school because

108
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:53,530
three reasons, very good reasons. She'll lose her complexion.

109
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,674
I mean, I'm going to get tanned. They like me because I was light

110
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:59,954
skinned. For Pakistan people, that is the thing. Two,

111
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:04,018
I'll have affairs because that's what happens. He doesn't want his fiance to go

112
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:07,446
to school to have affairs. And three, that I

113
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,302
wasn't going to work anyway after school. So why

114
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:14,754
waste your money? So three good reasons. Loose complexion,

115
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:18,514
she'll have affairs and she's not going to be working after marriage

116
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:22,166
anyway. Why are you wasting your money? Very good reasons. But here's

117
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:26,262
the interesting part. Not only that, they actually recommended

118
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:30,314
three things that I should be doing or my parents should be doing to

119
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:34,318
help. The first one is to learn to cook different types of

120
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:37,966
breakfasts because my fiance didn't eat

121
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:40,800
the same breakfast every day. So I mean,

122
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,666
of course that's a useful skill because that's how I'm going to make my husband

123
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,094
happy. So one was to learn to cook different types of breakfast

124
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,974
every day. Number two was to lose weight.

125
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:54,434
I was fat. I mean, I wasn't fat. I was athletic. But there's no

126
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:58,002
such thing as athletic in Pakistan. I should lose fat and

127
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:01,062
stop eating rice and potatoes and focus on my looks.

128
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:04,386
And the third thing is, I should learn to be a good housewife

129
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,526
and learn all the skills that I need to. If I really need to go

130
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:10,358
to school, I could go to home economics and just focus on how to be

131
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,818
a good housewife. These are the lessons that they believed that were going

132
00:08:13,824 --> 00:08:17,514
to be useful to me, helpful to my parents, versus going to school

133
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:20,714
for software engineering. And how could I? I mean, he was also, by the way,

134
00:08:20,752 --> 00:08:23,958
an engineer. How could I compete with my fiance?

135
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:27,566
So my mom was dedicated. And I remember she looked at me in the

136
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:31,342
eye and said, I am so sorry. We made another mistake. We rushed into

137
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:34,382
it and I think we're going to end this for you. I just couldn't believe

138
00:08:34,436 --> 00:08:37,860
it. I mean, once, sure, you can get away. Second time,

139
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,114
yes. My dad got home from work and my mom told him everything.

140
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:45,666
And my dad asked me for the rink back. I mean, I knew this

141
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,950
was legit, this was going to happen. And so

142
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,246
my dad called up my fiance's mom and said, we would

143
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:56,070
like to have you over tonight and talk about something important. And guess what?

144
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,590
They were waiting to come to our house. They came over

145
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,130
that night in full core with ten people. They have their family,

146
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,634
like the brothers, the sisters, the kids. Everybody came to tell

147
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:10,314
us how it was going to be done. And my dad, he just looked

148
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:13,742
at them and he's like, whoa, before you say anything else,

149
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:16,670
here is your ring back. This engagement is over.

150
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,926
My daughter, again, is not a burden on me. And you have shown us

151
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:24,066
your true colors even before marriage. And it was over.

152
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:27,726
They were crying. And anyway, long story short, that engagement ended,

153
00:09:27,758 --> 00:09:31,042
too. So the lesson I learned from that was to commit to

154
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:34,830
yourself. I knew that crying

155
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,780
was going to help a little bit, but because I had done it before,

156
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,086
this was not going to fly. This time, I needed a legit reason. But I

157
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:45,494
did that by really working hard to get into

158
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:48,878
the best school, because that was so important. I mean, in Pakistan

159
00:09:48,914 --> 00:09:52,202
and a lot of cultures like Pakistan, education is everything.

160
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:55,494
Like, you need to be a doctor, scientist, lawyer,

161
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,906
engineer, all of those things, and you're respected. And I

162
00:09:58,928 --> 00:10:02,622
had gotten into the best schools. So that

163
00:10:02,676 --> 00:10:06,510
was the one thing. If I had just sobbed and not worked

164
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,014
hard to get into this school, I mean, none of this stuff

165
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:13,714
would have happened, right? So commit to yourself.

166
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:17,806
Show up for yourself. That is an important lesson

167
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,746
that I've learned that we all need to do to

168
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:25,410
further our lives in the way that we want. Last story.

169
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,346
Story number three. Fast forward ten years from then.

170
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,854
I'm in Canada. Barriers to the guy of my dreams. I have two little

171
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:36,146
girls. I'm a mother of them, and they're just so wonderful.

172
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:39,218
And I have all the support in the world. It sounds fantastic,

173
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:43,050
but less than three years ago, I had an idea about my company,

174
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,314
Locelle. I wanted to be an entrepreneur. Many people told

175
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:49,466
me that only 5% of ceos in tech are women.

176
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:52,602
And over 90% of the tech startups fail in the first year.

177
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:56,350
So if you put the two and two together, the chances of me failing were

178
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,854
really, really high. Why bother? Not as many

179
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:03,886
female role models. And even today, there are so few women

180
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:08,034
leading tech companies. And I could have taken the easy route or

181
00:11:08,072 --> 00:11:11,246
get worried. Fear of failure, fear of losing. Fear of rejection.

182
00:11:11,358 --> 00:11:14,990
But I have two little girls, and I want them to lead life fearlessly.

183
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,086
And I wanted to set a really good example, not just for them, but for

184
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:21,378
other women and girls. So instead of fear of failure, I focused

185
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,800
on the fear of regret. Hey, sure,

186
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,526
a lot of companies fail, but what if I was one

187
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:31,146
of a few success stories? What if I didn't even try? I would never know.

188
00:11:31,248 --> 00:11:35,050
So when you have that feeling that you want to do something, go for it,

189
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,822
listen to it. It's rarely ever wrong. Lots of failures,

190
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:41,786
lots of challenges. But I have no regrets.

191
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,894
I've pursued every opportunity, including this.

192
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:48,906
And we're working with amazing tech companies, very reputable

193
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:52,830
tech companies, as clients, and we're making the world a better place.

194
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,382
We are on a mission to create equitable workplaces

195
00:11:56,446 --> 00:11:59,614
for women. And that's exactly what we're doing through our mentorship,

196
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:03,202
through our guidance, through our democratization of access

197
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:07,138
to knowledge for women. Because, again, we don't

198
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:11,314
have a playbook. We are creating that playbook. So, I challenge

199
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:15,330
status quo. I am one of the 5% of the CEO

200
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,790
in Canada today, but 90% of the companies

201
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,682
fail. Sure, I knew I would try it and see

202
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:26,506
what if I became one of the 10% of the companies that

203
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:29,594
actually succeeded? And I'm so excited to share with you that

204
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:33,326
we actually just celebrated a third anniversary last week,

205
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:36,942
and less than 30%

206
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:40,350
of the companies actually make it beyond the three years.

207
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,010
So in some ways, we have already challenged status quo.

208
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,362
And we have actually done a lot core than people

209
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:50,658
expected of me. I challenge status quo every single day.

210
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:53,406
By being a woman in tech, by being a woman leader,

211
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:57,398
CEO in tech, woman of color. And it's all worth it.

212
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:01,014
So with all these three stories, I want to share. Recap the

213
00:13:01,052 --> 00:13:04,834
common three lessons. One, challenge. The status quo.

214
00:13:04,962 --> 00:13:08,614
Especially if it's the right thing to do. There will be people who will

215
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:12,074
tell you what to do, do what feels right to you. Two,

216
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,546
persevere. Persevere with all your might for

217
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:18,746
the right things in your life. Never give up. And the

218
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:21,962
last lesson that I can share with you today is to commit to

219
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:25,326
yourself. Show up for yourself. And I know a lot of

220
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:29,226
themes, especially has girls, just people in general. We're raised

221
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:32,622
to put others before us, care for others, especially women

222
00:13:32,676 --> 00:13:36,462
and girls. And we give more than we take. But you know what? Sometimes it's

223
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:40,754
really good to be selfish and show up for yourself and put yourself first.

224
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:44,286
And so I'm now happily married with two girls. I'm an entrepreneur.

225
00:13:44,318 --> 00:13:47,890
I'm doing great things with my company, and I can tell you, even my family

226
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,182
is very happy. My parents are so proud. They share about me with everybody.

227
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:55,414
My girls have someone to look up to, and I'm helping other women

228
00:13:55,532 --> 00:13:58,790
because I did challenge the status quo. I did persevere,

229
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,902
and I showed up for myself. So today, I encourage

230
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,678
all of you to connect with people at this conference.

231
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:09,562
Reach out. They're amazing leaders here.

232
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:13,306
And show up for yourself. And today, I also

233
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:17,294
want you to think of something you really, really want for yourself. Write it down

234
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:21,038
and focus on it. Something you'll regret in life if you

235
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:24,542
don't go for your dreams. So I'm going to end this talk by

236
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:27,998
sharing that. Do not let the fear of failure stop

237
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:32,234
you from shaping your life. Use the fear of regret

238
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:36,614
to drive you to do the great things you are meant to do.

239
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:37,620
Thank you so much.
