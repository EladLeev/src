00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,486
Hello and welcome. My name is Mihankowski and today I would like to

2
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:26,886
talk you through the journey about out quantum computing. I would

3
00:00:26,908 --> 00:00:30,966
like to ask from the question is it actually real or

4
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:34,578
is it hype? Just brief introduction

5
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:37,946
of myself. I'm working for objectivity. I'm ahead of

6
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:43,450
emerging technologies so I onboarding

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,958
cuttingedge technologies to our customer organizations.

8
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:50,810
Right now my main focus is quantum computing.

9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,150
Previously I was focusing on Nova roll call, looking on my whole

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,402
career. I'm person with a strong technical background,

11
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:02,880
still working and playing with the technology,

12
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,414
sharing the knowledge during different events like this and others organizing conferences

13
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:12,222
and I'm also Microsoft MVP in category Asia.

14
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:16,174
I would like to encourage you to scan the contact or invite me on

15
00:01:16,232 --> 00:01:19,654
LinkedIn because if you have any question just

16
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:22,934
ping me on LinkedIn or send

17
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:25,720
me an email and I'm happy to answer all your questions.

18
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,094
Organization when I'm working in objectivity

19
00:01:31,142 --> 00:01:34,586
is a software house. It is part of Accenture and we

20
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:38,090
are existing on the market over 30 years already.

21
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,362
We are specializing in building custom made solution

22
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:45,918
for our customers and this is our core service and

23
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:49,326
together those core services we have some additional services like

24
00:01:49,348 --> 00:01:53,140
quantum computing, data and AI, machine learning and similar.

25
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:58,850
But today I would like to focus on

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,246
just brief introduction to the quantum technology agenda

27
00:02:03,278 --> 00:02:07,174
is very easy. I would like to ask on the question what

28
00:02:07,212 --> 00:02:10,886
is quantum computing, why we should look at this right

29
00:02:10,908 --> 00:02:14,598
now and how it can affect my organization. I've been

30
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:18,780
talking about this technology from the perspective that we are looking on

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,926
in our organization and I will give you also some insights

32
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:28,154
when I not cover some kind of the topics and I will leave them

33
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:31,966
for you. So let's start with the question, what is

34
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:34,960
quantum technology? Quantum technology,

35
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,942
this is the new way of maybe not so new away,

36
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:42,886
but this is like a way of making the calculation

37
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:46,926
that give us a possibility either getting results

38
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,194
faster, either getting better quality results, or working

39
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:53,970
with bigger problems. Also, there's a possibility that

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,610
when we are running quantum algorithm we could get multiple scenarios.

41
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,034
And this is based on the quantum physics and quantum phenomenon.

42
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:05,682
I do not want to go deeper into this topic

43
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:08,970
because I'm afraid that

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,778
if I would like to do it correctly, it should take like

45
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:15,850
almost half of the presentation.

46
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,986
If you think about what is the difference between quantum computing

47
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:23,374
and classical computing, think about the book.

48
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:26,398
If you have classical computer,

49
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:30,190
you need to read page by page. If you have quantum device,

50
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,210
you can read the whole book at once and

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,062
think about the calculation, thinking about solving complex

52
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:41,170
problems. This is like this on this maze,

53
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,414
like this animation of the maze. You can see that

54
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:49,382
each time that we are just having

55
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:53,266
a junction there, we can check both group path

56
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:56,946
in the same way. Very often when I'm talking about the quantum

57
00:03:56,978 --> 00:04:00,954
computing, there's always a question, will it replace the

58
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:04,422
classical computing? Actually not. For me, it is like an extension,

59
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:07,814
like something that will be working in concurrent

60
00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:11,166
way. Some of the problems will be solved on the classical computer. Some of the

61
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:14,910
problems will be able to run on the quantum devices.

62
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,894
Looking on different predictions, it seems

63
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:22,426
that the quantum computing will have bigger

64
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:26,660
adoption from the commercial perspective between five to ten years.

65
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,322
I providing here a quote from the report, state of the quantum 2022

66
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:36,098
from November 2022. And you can see there in the report there

67
00:04:36,104 --> 00:04:39,970
is information that 63% believes that commercialization

68
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,960
of the quantum computing will hit the market in next five years.

69
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:48,860
If we extend this timeline to 2030,

70
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,206
90% of organizations believe that they will be transferred

71
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:57,050
by quantum computing. And actually probably

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,274
you are thinking what is possible in the quantum computing.

73
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,726
And when I started my

74
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:07,198
journey, I was thinking, is it possible to run my application on the

75
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:10,826
quantum device? And it was easier

76
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:16,014
than I expected. This is example of IBM

77
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:19,586
quantum composer. This is one of the quantum devices that is available in the

78
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:23,810
cloud. And you can see here that the

79
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,406
screen is divided into five parts. On the left, top, left side

80
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:32,086
you can see there's operations. So this is the quantum gates that you

81
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:34,920
can put into the circuit. In the center.

82
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,178
You have already modeled a quantum circuit

83
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:44,006
by me. So you can see that in the circuit we are setting

84
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:47,830
the qubit to zero, then applying node gate.

85
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,206
It is working in very similar way like a classical node gate.

86
00:05:51,238 --> 00:05:53,902
So if we have zero, we are changing to one. If we have one,

87
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:57,790
we are changing to zero. And at the end we are measuring

88
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,266
the status of the qubit. This is visuala

89
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:05,860
representation. On the right side you have the

90
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,798
example implementation in one of the languages. Actually here is Opencasm

91
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:16,242
2.0. When you can see that we are setting the register

92
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:20,114
with zero to zero, then we are applying x gate

93
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:23,446
on zero and measuring it. In the bottom you have

94
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:26,998
a prediction. This is a simulation of the

95
00:06:27,004 --> 00:06:30,402
circuit. And you can see probably as you expected,

96
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:34,218
that if we have zero, if we are applying node gate, we are

97
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:37,754
getting one. So you can see this. On the lower left

98
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:40,638
side you can see that there is one. And also this is in the middle,

99
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:43,406
in the bottom, in the center,

100
00:06:43,508 --> 00:06:46,750
there's other representation of that. And this is

101
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,462
what you get without even logging to the system. You just open

102
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:54,206
the environment and you can use it if

103
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,066
you would like. To run this circuit on the real quantum device on

104
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:01,378
the right side you have set up and run. To do that you

105
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:05,026
need to just log into environment. So this is also you don't need

106
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:09,186
to provide any credit card, you can get just the device

107
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:12,630
and run it. When you hit this button

108
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,726
you get information about different devices. So some of them are

109
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:20,422
available for free, some of them are paid version.

110
00:07:20,486 --> 00:07:24,186
Actually the bigger quantum devices are

111
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,866
available by paying for

112
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:31,802
the access. Also you can see their information

113
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:35,370
about total pending jobs. This is a queue

114
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,974
that your job will be next one. So you need to wait

115
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:45,234
a bit. It depends on the time of the day and when

116
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:49,234
those processes that was scheduled before you will be

117
00:07:49,272 --> 00:07:53,730
completed, then your process will be also executed.

118
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,734
As you can see here I select IBM Oslo. There is

119
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:01,414
over 300 jobs before my job

120
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,646
and this computer has seven qubits and first queue to

121
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,946
quantum bulb. If I hit the

122
00:08:07,968 --> 00:08:11,834
run button then I would love to show you

123
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:15,802
real time demo on this presentation. But actually we will need to wait

124
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:19,820
a bit. So I just

125
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,266
share the results in the moment. This is default

126
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:27,898
setup and as you can see there are bigger quantum devices.

127
00:08:27,994 --> 00:08:29,406
There's like 64,

128
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:33,118
128 qubit quantum

129
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:36,850
volume devices, different type of the number of qubits.

130
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,834
So you can just select on

131
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:42,900
which devices you would like to run the application.

132
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,226
I decided to run this on the, on the smaller one, because for one qubit

133
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:51,410
we don't need to have like a bigger device.

134
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,526
And after running that we are getting the

135
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:59,434
results. So you can see that actually we was waiting about

136
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:02,966
31 minutes in the queue, the system, the algorithm

137
00:09:02,998 --> 00:09:05,770
was running 2 seconds.

138
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,134
And you can see also here that we was running

139
00:09:10,272 --> 00:09:13,310
1024 times of the circuit.

140
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,050
Why? Because when we are working with the quantum devices,

141
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,750
we need to think about probabilistic approach

142
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,220
and you can see that as a results. Most of

143
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,874
our measurements as are predicted in the value of one,

144
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:33,106
but some of them have also zero value.

145
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:37,586
And actually this is when we, from our perspective

146
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:42,262
looking on these results, we can say that almost 95%

147
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:45,906
about this number, the results

148
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:49,806
will be one. This is because the coherence times, because the noise,

149
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:53,866
because different type of the challenges that current quantum computer

150
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,802
have. If we have a bigger circuit then

151
00:09:57,856 --> 00:10:01,566
we have like a distribution because this is just one qubit here.

152
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,326
And then when we are looking on the

153
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:08,798
results we should have the maximum point of

154
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:12,106
the distribution. As to answer in most cases

155
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:15,906
and think about that. This is changing the way how we are working with the

156
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:19,234
computing. We know from the classical world that two plus two is

157
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:23,054
four. When we run the same application with quantum computing,

158
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:27,622
we should say two plus four is in 99% or maybe 95%.

159
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:29,400
It depends on the device four.

160
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,246
So you can see that you can

161
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:40,074
very easy run and I encourage you to just take

162
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:43,306
a moment after this session and run your first algorithm on

163
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,794
the quantum devices. And this is the way that

164
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:50,650
we are modeling the circuit very deeply

165
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,778
by using the quantum gates. But let's

166
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:57,760
think about why we should look on this technology.

167
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,686
And I already started at the beginning with the one of

168
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,858
the quotes that the future is almost there.

169
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:09,938
If you look on the different components like Capgemini Ey,

170
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,806
you can see that they are also providing very same results.

171
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:17,142
2025 2027 three to five years.

172
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:21,474
So that kind of the reports, and I encourage

173
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:25,494
you to read either UI or Capgemini report

174
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,778
about the quantum computer. They're a very nice report and you can learn a

175
00:11:28,784 --> 00:11:32,186
lot from them. They're also predicting that the

176
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,734
quantum technology will start disrupting

177
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:39,402
our market in next maybe three to ten years.

178
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:42,480
It depends how you are optimistic about the technology.

179
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,194
Very interesting report is also have been created by Heparin

180
00:11:47,242 --> 00:11:51,520
Research and published in November 2022.

181
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,046
They check in

182
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:58,986
the ecosystem of area adopters,

183
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,626
how successful PoC that they created that

184
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:06,200
they run on those devices. And looking at the report,

185
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,110
they are mentioning that area adopters are highly satisfied with their most

186
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,990
important quantum computing development activity.

187
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,550
Almost all quantum computing area adopters survey

188
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,486
indicated that progress to date was either very or somehow

189
00:12:22,518 --> 00:12:25,962
successful. So the algorithms that

190
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:29,734
they run, the problems that they wanted to solve in this quantum computing

191
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,640
was successful looking on the market.

192
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:37,326
I just provided we had two

193
00:12:37,348 --> 00:12:41,322
groups of the vendors. On the one side we have hardware vendors.

194
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,006
You can see here Microsoft, Google, Interhb, Alibaba, D Wave

195
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:48,546
and IBM. And there are many more vendors that are

196
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,746
providing quantum computing. Quantum devices that

197
00:12:51,768 --> 00:12:56,002
you can access. And actually it is important and

198
00:12:56,056 --> 00:12:59,414
interesting how you can access to these devices. On the one

199
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,950
side you can buy devices by your own.

200
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,200
It is not cheap device and probably it is

201
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,218
good. In the next year you need to buy the new one because the technology

202
00:13:10,304 --> 00:13:13,878
is growing so fast. But much more easier

203
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:17,306
way to start using quantum devices is

204
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:21,078
either run your application on one of the quantum vendors

205
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:24,366
clouds or also in the public clouds like

206
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,706
Microsoft or AWS. And there instead of buying

207
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:31,166
quantum devices, you can just render for a minute for

208
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:34,626
the run of the circuit. This is like for me

209
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,740
a game changer, especially when I'm working with the customers

210
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,786
and I can use the public

211
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,486
allow that they already have in the organization. And it is much

212
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:50,438
more easier to create and

213
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:53,974
also verify the proof of concept with those customers, because for them,

214
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:57,602
in the long term usage of the quantum

215
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,340
computing, if for example we use either Microsoft or

216
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,650
Azure cloud, it'd be like additional invoice,

217
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,646
additional row on their invoice. So it is much more easier

218
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:12,558
to get it because we don't need to have a legal check because

219
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:16,160
it should be already done for the scrubs. On the other side,

220
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,766
you can see a lot of area adopters that are checking the

221
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:24,660
technology, looking on this technology, trying to

222
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,574
somehow predict its potential. And those area adopters

223
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:33,774
are from the different sectors.

224
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:36,878
You can see here, aerospace, banks,

225
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:40,934
automotive, Freetown, finance and many more.

226
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,830
And this is just top of the iceberg,

227
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,546
which is very interesting when

228
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:55,754
I'm talking about the quantum, discussing about the quantum from

229
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,654
my perspective, it is also a lot of fear in this discussion.

230
00:14:59,702 --> 00:15:03,520
And looking on all of my previous experience,

231
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,950
I haven't seen such much fear

232
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,640
in scope of the discussion about the technology. And this is

233
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,954
strictly connected with the fear about

234
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:21,694
the possibility that on the one side, quantum computing

235
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:25,586
can break the encryption keys. That encryption methods that we are

236
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:29,666
using on daily, on daily life, think about that with

237
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:34,226
the quantum device will be very easy decrypt

238
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:37,946
the communication between our computer and our bank. So this

239
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:41,338
is one of the topics is security. And you are trying to

240
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:44,826
find the new way of sending, how to

241
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:48,634
send the information in secure way. From the

242
00:15:48,672 --> 00:15:52,474
business perspective. The other dimension

243
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:56,320
of fear is also that what will happen if we miss the moment,

244
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,246
think about that. Somebody will develop the

245
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:04,594
algorithm that will be give

246
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:07,838
him like competitive advantage for the organization.

247
00:16:08,014 --> 00:16:11,620
A huge competitive advantage actually.

248
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,940
He can live in bug all of the components that

249
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,470
didn't manage to work on the quantum computing.

250
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,240
Right now, regarding them

251
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,354
computing back to the security, there is a question

252
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:34,714
about the standards and there are already work to

253
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:37,878
standardize the new way of using quantum devices

254
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:42,442
and the new way how we should work with the encryption.

255
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:46,222
We are looking, we as human being,

256
00:16:46,276 --> 00:16:49,994
we are looking of the new algorithms that are either quantum

257
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:53,650
safe or we'll be using this on the quantum devices.

258
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,794
So we are trying to prepare to the future, and this is a huge

259
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:01,122
unknown when this

260
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:04,514
future will get us.

261
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:07,862
And this is strictly connected to what I said

262
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,510
before. Maybe in two years, maybe in ten years, but definitely

263
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,994
it will happen. Talking about the quantum

264
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:18,810
devices, especially when I finish the session and we have

265
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,062
a discussion next to the with the coffee,

266
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:26,906
there is always a question about the bitcoin, if we'll be able

267
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:30,122
to decrypt the bitcoin and for that

268
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:33,486
kind of the cryptocurrencies some of them are

269
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:36,926
quantum safe, some of them are not quantum safe. But I don't want to

270
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:40,320
go here into more detail.

271
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,354
I would like to share with you with my opinion why I

272
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:50,740
believe that this revolution is happening right now.

273
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,802
From my perspective, this is like three main

274
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:58,070
reasons. First of all, I already mentioned

275
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,766
that we

276
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:05,000
can run quantum application in the cloud.

277
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,394
When I started my journey with quantum computing like over one

278
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:13,962
year ago, I thought that will be something

279
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:18,074
very special, something that will need to have a

280
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:20,960
very specific competences in that area.

281
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,950
And that's true. But my thought evolve,

282
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,906
my thinking evolve. And right now, for me, the quantum

283
00:18:30,938 --> 00:18:34,606
computing is one of the methods that we are using to some

284
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:38,074
kind of the challenges. Sometimes classical

285
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:42,334
computer can be better, sometimes quantum computing can be better, sometimes it

286
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,640
could be hybrid. But the

287
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,302
possibility that we can run those application on the

288
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:52,998
cloud, in our existing application

289
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:56,902
ecosystem give us the opportunity that we can very

290
00:18:56,956 --> 00:19:01,914
easily check the

291
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:06,730
new method, check how quantum computing is affecting previous calculation.

292
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,302
And on the right side you can see Microsoft Azure cloud,

293
00:19:12,436 --> 00:19:15,774
Microsoft Quantum, and you can see

294
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:19,566
that there is like six quantum vendors that

295
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:23,326
you can run, six quantum

296
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:26,980
computing providers that you can select and run the application,

297
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,798
selecting one of them, Quantum, Toshibia, QCI,

298
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:33,090
regetti, Pascal, IonQ,

299
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,738
you can select one of those providers,

300
00:19:38,834 --> 00:19:41,986
run your application and will be charged for the usage.

301
00:19:42,018 --> 00:19:45,766
So this is like something that you can very easily try

302
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:50,090
your application, check how it's easy to

303
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,418
start using that kind of technology.

304
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:57,610
And actually Microsoft also giving you some additional credits

305
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,010
that you can use in this purpose.

306
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,118
The second very interesting and important

307
00:20:05,284 --> 00:20:09,006
vector that is helping me believing that is

308
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:12,714
happening also right now is looking on the technology

309
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:17,620
roadmaps from different quantum providers and

310
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,142
progression in a speed improvement

311
00:20:22,206 --> 00:20:25,282
of quantum processors. Those processors are right now

312
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:28,374
looking backwards into the past.

313
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:32,278
All of the quantum vendors, most of the quantum vendors, and especially

314
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,590
looking on those major ones like for example IBM,

315
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,666
they are keeping their promise. They are

316
00:20:40,688 --> 00:20:45,738
keeping their promise with developing the new

317
00:20:45,904 --> 00:20:49,434
quantum processors with bigger number of the qubits. Those number

318
00:20:49,472 --> 00:20:53,034
of qubits allow us on the one side to handle error

319
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:56,830
correction, on the other side allow us to handle

320
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,922
bigger problems in this ecosystem.

321
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:05,026
And this is growing very fast. The last

322
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:09,060
thing, and for me, the first and the last thing are the most important.

323
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,610
What is happening on those roadmaps.

324
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,350
In previous years, we was mostly focusing on the

325
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,414
number of the qubits. And right

326
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:25,766
now we are switching the direction into building

327
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,570
interconnectivity between quantum processors.

328
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,778
So we are learning, we are developing the technologies that

329
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:36,854
allow us to scale

330
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:40,574
up those machines and why it has been so

331
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:43,390
important. From my perspective,

332
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,534
looking on my whole journey with

333
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:51,002
the computers, I started very eerie. My first computer was Commodore

334
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:55,346
64, then intel two

335
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:59,166
eight, six. And I remember all of those single core

336
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:06,194
processors. I remember all of the parameters when

337
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:09,334
we moved to multicore processors. Actually,

338
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:12,966
I didn't remember I was looking on those parameters when

339
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:16,626
I was buying a cpu, when I was buying a new processor

340
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:20,122
in a computer. But then I forget the

341
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:24,586
speed improvement was so high that

342
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:28,278
I stopped caring about that because the speed

343
00:22:28,294 --> 00:22:32,398
of the processor was not the main parameter that was

344
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,434
important at the way. More important was the architecture,

345
00:22:35,482 --> 00:22:39,166
how those processor are cooperating with each

346
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:42,678
other, how many threads we can run in concurrent

347
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:45,810
way. And this is happening also with the quantum computing.

348
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,514
So I

349
00:22:52,552 --> 00:22:56,578
hope you, I encourage you that this is something important,

350
00:22:56,744 --> 00:23:00,582
and I hope, I encourage you that you just give a moment

351
00:23:00,636 --> 00:23:04,680
to this technology and check what is possible with that.

352
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,854
So let's think how we can check this technology,

353
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:13,834
and let's think how

354
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:15,850
this technology can affect your organization.

355
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,686
This is very important how you should check cuttingedge

356
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:24,734
technology and checking if actual ibis is real.

357
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:28,830
When I was starting with my journey with the quantum computing,

358
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,494
I know that as I mentioned at the beginning,

359
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:38,226
I'm technical person, so I'd love to play with

360
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:41,538
the technology. But actually I said that

361
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:44,874
I will not touch the technology at the beginning.

362
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:48,600
I would talk with the organization, with the people that

363
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,670
claim that they are using quantum devices.

364
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,974
Why this is so important? Because from my

365
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:02,140
perspective, if I want to offer the technology to our customers,

366
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,260
to people to discuss about this technology,

367
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,838
these technologies should bring the value to the organization,

368
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:13,310
should bring the business value, so it should generate

369
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,454
benefit for the people that are using the technology.

370
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:20,874
And when I see an initial benefit

371
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:25,060
of this technology, this means that this is a good moment that

372
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,506
we should think about this technology. And actually my first talks with

373
00:24:29,528 --> 00:24:32,750
this was with the organization that are using the quantum devices,

374
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,414
checking what value it is deriving,

375
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,640
checking if actually this is delivering any value.

376
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,118
Checking how easy is to learn quantum computing, how easy is to

377
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:47,946
develop algorithm, asking typical questions, how long it takes to

378
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:51,594
learn it, what type of the skills are needed? How much does

379
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:55,530
it cost? What is the value this technology generated?

380
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,740
Based on the answer on those questions,

381
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,120
I started to thinking, is it a good moment or not?

382
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,914
And as you can see, I'm talking about the quantum computing. I'm building quantum computing

383
00:25:09,962 --> 00:25:13,778
division in objectivity. So probably I get

384
00:25:13,864 --> 00:25:17,970
a lot of positive information here. And from our perspective,

385
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,414
looking on the quantum computing, there are mostly three areas

386
00:25:22,462 --> 00:25:27,042
of interest optimization. So solving

387
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:30,914
complex combinatorial problems optimization related

388
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,070
to staffing, scheduling, supply chain logistics.

389
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,534
The other area is modeling. So predicting customer behaviors,

390
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:42,490
forecasting team and future dementor of sales, or maybe

391
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,458
predicting the financial markets. And something

392
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,900
that looks very also interesting is quantum machine learning,

393
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,578
training models with the less data detecting

394
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,086
and management with the data, improvement in decision making with

395
00:25:57,108 --> 00:26:01,434
the classifier. Those three areas

396
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:05,502
are strictly connected with the services that we are having in objectivity.

397
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:09,540
And I'm saying, and saying

398
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,682
very high here that those three

399
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:17,378
areas are connected with the things that we are doing in the organization

400
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:21,190
when I'm working and why. I'm saying

401
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,526
that because in objectivity we

402
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:29,702
don't have in our offering topics

403
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,060
related communication and the security.

404
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,426
And this is something that I already mentioned, that we are

405
00:26:36,448 --> 00:26:39,180
afraid in this technology.

406
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,530
So if you are looking on this technology, think about

407
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,866
those additional additional areas. How we can use quantum computing

408
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:51,742
in communication, how we can send

409
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:55,666
the messages from

410
00:26:55,688 --> 00:26:59,620
the sender to receiver in the secure way. Think about

411
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,538
encryption, how this technology can

412
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:07,474
affect already using encryption

413
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:10,934
algorithms, how we can create any algorithms that will

414
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:14,310
support us. And also think about the sensing,

415
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:19,466
think about what type of sensors we can build with the

416
00:27:19,488 --> 00:27:23,866
technology. Figure out or think about that

417
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:28,940
with this technology, we can create

418
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,146
a sensor that will work like GPS and actually don't

419
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:36,926
need to have the link to satellite because it

420
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:40,810
will be so precise that it will just react

421
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:44,706
on different changes of

422
00:27:44,728 --> 00:27:48,178
magnetic fields. And based on this information, it can

423
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:51,550
position yourself on the earth.

424
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,126
And think about that. It can work under the ground, under the

425
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:58,120
water. This is like a possibility of this technology.

426
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:04,854
I'm just briefly finishing my talk

427
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:08,566
and I would like to show you two examples, what we managed

428
00:28:08,598 --> 00:28:11,958
to deliver in objectivity, in scope of the quantum computing.

429
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:15,594
First one, this is our PoC. This is

430
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:18,842
PoC when we are trying to help our

431
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:22,910
CEO to plan trips between our offices.

432
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,746
This is the result of one of the hackathons.

433
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:31,534
The hackathon was happening before the Christmas and

434
00:28:31,572 --> 00:28:35,410
we was helping our CEO to allow

435
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,830
him to meet with all of the people between our offices

436
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,210
and wish them merry Christmas directly.

437
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,322
So on the one side we have information about

438
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:49,782
availability of the people in the offices. On the other side we have

439
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:53,074
information about flights, shuttle between our offices.

440
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:56,360
And you can see here that on the main screen

441
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,950
our CEO is able to plan his trip. He can decide

442
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,930
if for him is the most important part, lower price,

443
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,834
shorter flight, or maybe minimization of the co2

444
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:11,374
generation. He can select the start

445
00:29:11,492 --> 00:29:15,470
office. He can select final

446
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,502
office, of course, end date is the Christmas, and also start date

447
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:22,880
is configurable. And also there's a possibility of

448
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,518
selecting the preference of how many days you would like to stare

449
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:31,314
in different places. When I hit the find the best trip button,

450
00:29:31,512 --> 00:29:34,734
I'm sending the defined problem to the quantum device.

451
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:38,486
And you can see we have Schrodinger card and in few seconds we'll get

452
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:42,038
the results. So in this particular

453
00:29:42,124 --> 00:29:45,666
case we are using DYF quantum annular.

454
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:49,450
So this is one of the types of the quantum devices.

455
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:54,186
And I'm showing this application to you because here is

456
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:57,546
a good example that this technology exists and we

457
00:29:57,568 --> 00:30:00,860
can integrate it with our existing application.

458
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,706
So you can see here that we find a solution, you can see the successful

459
00:30:05,738 --> 00:30:08,954
criteria, you can see which people you are meeting in each offices,

460
00:30:09,002 --> 00:30:10,560
you can see the flight plan,

461
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:16,210
and this is the integration typical like the others,

462
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,938
by just using API. And you can see that

463
00:30:20,024 --> 00:30:23,300
the communication have been done almost in the real time.

464
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,666
The second PoC that we conducted

465
00:30:29,698 --> 00:30:33,686
with our customer was related to

466
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:37,080
planning the production of

467
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:42,118
goods. That value was increasing

468
00:30:42,214 --> 00:30:46,502
in the time. And here we get from the customer recipe,

469
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:49,420
we get the information about the,

470
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,014
we get the information about the elements that are needed to

471
00:30:56,212 --> 00:31:00,046
product this good, and the number of those items in

472
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:04,370
the warehouses, and we manage. And also our goal was to maximize,

473
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,482
our goal was to maximize the production in those next

474
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,030
13 years. Actually we managed

475
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,506
to reduce the calculation time by using quantum device

476
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,430
from 4 hours to 90 seconds.

477
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,934
But this is just one of the benefits of

478
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:28,794
this technology. The more interesting benefits was that

479
00:31:28,912 --> 00:31:32,620
together with this reduction of the time,

480
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:38,234
reduction of time needed for calculation, we managed to

481
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:42,030
also generate additional scenarios of the solution.

482
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,222
Why this is so important? Because if customer would

483
00:31:48,276 --> 00:31:50,400
like to, for example,

484
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:54,946
reduce the level of the insurance of their

485
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:59,374
warehouses, or maybe reduce the number of the operation

486
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,490
in those warehouses,

487
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,758
it is much more easier to have multiple scenarios

488
00:32:05,774 --> 00:32:09,730
and just scoring the scenarios of finding which one is the best

489
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,906
from the positional criteria, instead of adding

490
00:32:13,938 --> 00:32:17,570
new dimensions to the model. And also you

491
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,014
can see from the time perspective, this 90 seconds

492
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:24,346
means that he can, and of

493
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:27,994
course it depends on the scenario, it can take

494
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:31,534
decision almost in the real time. So this is like

495
00:32:31,572 --> 00:32:35,166
a possibility that this technology is giving to

496
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:38,414
us. Probably you are thinking how the

497
00:32:38,452 --> 00:32:42,686
code can look like on the one side. I already show you how

498
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:45,890
we can develop the algorithms by using quantum gates.

499
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,482
But the quantum gates looks like assembler and probably you don't want

500
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:54,594
to work with this technology that way. If we use

501
00:32:54,712 --> 00:32:58,278
higher level languages, higher level libraries, you can

502
00:32:58,284 --> 00:33:02,486
see that the application looks very similar to something what

503
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:06,086
we know from the current model. Do some kind of

504
00:33:06,108 --> 00:33:09,666
initialization of the object and building and adding

505
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:13,306
some kind of variables, then distributing some

506
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:16,474
kind of elements. But you can see if you go

507
00:33:16,512 --> 00:33:19,882
deeply in the code. If you show this

508
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:23,642
code to somebody who is for example, data scientist

509
00:33:23,706 --> 00:33:27,086
or machine learning engineer for some

510
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:31,326
of the libraries, it would be hard to check if this

511
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:35,794
problem is run on the classical computer or

512
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:39,710
on the classical device. How to prepare your organization

513
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,730
for the quantum revolution from our perspective,

514
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,166
we divided this process into four stages. First of

515
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:52,054
all, you need to build awareness in your organization. You need to help

516
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:56,230
your organization to understand what this technology is,

517
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,594
what is possible with this

518
00:33:59,632 --> 00:34:03,354
technology in the short, in the long term, and also

519
00:34:03,552 --> 00:34:07,146
how it will benefit for your

520
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:11,318
organization. Then working with the

521
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:15,406
organization in the discovery phase, you need to figure out a

522
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,246
roadmap of the potential use cases for the quantum technology.

523
00:34:19,428 --> 00:34:23,434
You should select the cases that will bring

524
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:26,158
and generate the biggest value for your organization.

525
00:34:26,334 --> 00:34:29,860
Prioritize them by the value and by the

526
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:33,890
study of the possibility of delivering this on the current devices.

527
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:39,986
And when you have this backlog, you should think about creating

528
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:43,602
like a business case, like a plan of the adoption.

529
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:47,350
Because in most cases you will need to find a sponsor

530
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,642
that will allow you to go further with that. The next

531
00:34:51,696 --> 00:34:55,526
stage is POC. So we are selecting the most beneficial,

532
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:59,740
the most possible to deliver project

533
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,886
and you are building proof of concept. So you are verifying the

534
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:07,114
idea, building a prototype and checking

535
00:35:07,242 --> 00:35:11,246
how this technology is behaving with the data. And actually here you

536
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:15,110
can get different results.

537
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,474
Either quantum computing will be successful either no.

538
00:35:19,592 --> 00:35:23,410
So this is very easy, but very often when we are working with

539
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,510
quantum technology, you will learn something about the process, you will learn

540
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,320
something about your challenge that you have and

541
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,346
it will affect also on the classical solution.

542
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:38,802
So even if you will be not successful

543
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:42,682
with the quantum projects, there is a huge chance that you will figure

544
00:35:42,736 --> 00:35:46,666
out something that will increase the value of the classical solution to

545
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:50,326
your organization. And I think this is the most important part when you are working

546
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:53,838
with the technology. Finally, it should generate the business

547
00:35:54,004 --> 00:35:57,358
value for your organization. And at the end,

548
00:35:57,444 --> 00:36:00,814
you need to think about delivering the application to the

549
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:04,466
production to allow your organization using

550
00:36:04,568 --> 00:36:07,940
this technology. Summar of this talk I would

551
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,714
try to answer on the question, is it really hype or

552
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:15,750
not? Actually, from my perspective, we can see

553
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,310
a huge hype on the topics related to quantum computing.

554
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,870
But still this huge hype has a strong justification.

555
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,498
Looking on how fast this technology is growing and

556
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:34,410
how fast, we can see the new information about adoption.

557
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,770
We can see a lot of use cases,

558
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,634
a lot of use cases of the quantum computing, quantum inspired or quantum

559
00:36:42,682 --> 00:36:46,954
hybrid projects that are verifying

560
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:50,846
and that are successful on the market. So this

561
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:54,434
is something that you should look to inspire you from

562
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:57,602
my perspective, and I'm very optimistic about technology,

563
00:36:57,736 --> 00:37:01,794
so just judge this information by

564
00:37:01,832 --> 00:37:05,406
yourself. Read a bit more about the quantum computing.

565
00:37:05,518 --> 00:37:08,902
But from my perspective, I would say that we should probably

566
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:12,502
think about waiting like additional two, four to five years

567
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:16,406
to get this technology enough mature to

568
00:37:16,428 --> 00:37:19,494
be ready for the universal purposes.

569
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:23,034
Right now, it is very good for the optimization for some kind

570
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,522
of narrow cases that are not suitable for the current

571
00:37:26,576 --> 00:37:30,494
devices. And multiple case

572
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:34,480
studies that we can see published in the market

573
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:40,590
shows that actually this technology is working and

574
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,994
providing advantage to organizations. So from

575
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:48,654
my perspective, I would recommend you that if you don't have quantum computing

576
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:52,386
technology in your strategic focus, in your

577
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:55,860
roadmap, put it there.

578
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,134
If you don't want to onboard it to this organization, if you don't

579
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:03,926
want to work with this technology and check it,

580
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:06,070
just have it on your radar,

581
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,634
try to remember it and check from time

582
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:14,426
to time because I would like to avoid the

583
00:38:14,448 --> 00:38:19,482
situation that you miss the moment that this technology will be actually very

584
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:23,290
beneficial for organization widely adopted.

585
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:26,590
With this thought, I would like to finish the presentation.

586
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,470
Please remember that I'm only message or a call away from you.

587
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,038
So let's together unlock the potential of

588
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:38,414
the quantum technology in your business operation. And if you have any
