1
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,026
Hi, I'm Emily Arnott. And I'm Nick Mason.

2
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:48,534
And we're here to present too many people in the room,

3
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:52,078
the incident room, that is. So here we're going to take a

4
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:55,934
look at an often overlooked challenge when

5
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,594
dealing with incidents, which is you can actually overcrowding

6
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,274
your incidents response. And this might seem a little counterintuitive.

7
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:06,046
So we're going to start off by talking about what we really mean when we

8
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:09,746
say too many people. Then we're going to take a look at this instinct to

9
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:13,074
kind of get all hands on deck. Why is it that you call in as

10
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:15,650
many people? Why do incidents get crowded?

11
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,186
Then we're going to take a look at how to achieve those goals

12
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:23,606
while still preventing overcrowding. We're going to look at how to manage

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,958
that urge during an instinct for people to rush in and try to help.

14
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:31,514
And then we're going to look at how to cement this in

15
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:35,174
with a cultural foundation to make this not just kind of an arbitrary

16
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:38,966
policy change, but to have a culture around incidents

17
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,230
where they don't end up getting overcrowded.

18
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,522
So you might ask, and I think this is a pretty reasonable

19
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:50,174
question, isn't having more people better? You might

20
00:01:50,212 --> 00:01:53,982
think when something goes wrong, it's pretty natural to just want

21
00:01:54,036 --> 00:01:57,426
as many people as possible there to help you out. And we don't want

22
00:01:57,448 --> 00:02:00,782
to discourage that type of thinking because it's true that people trend

23
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:04,180
to add value when they contribute to a problem.

24
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,158
There's tremendous value in bringing in a diversity of people that

25
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:12,130
might have fresh ideas, that might have a different perspective.

26
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,718
But if you just end up with too many people, if you kind

27
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:19,362
of go too far with this thinking, it can lead to

28
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:23,178
a lot of problems. So let's take a look at the problems

29
00:02:23,264 --> 00:02:26,986
here. As you can see, there's quite a few things can

30
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:29,660
get confusing. You might start to wonder,

31
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,566
what is each person doing? Communication kind of beats poor when

32
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,974
there's so many people. People might do redundant work. There might

33
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:40,574
be excessive communication, which you might

34
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:44,126
wonder what that looks like. But if you're scrolling through hours and hours worth

35
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:47,860
of slack messages, you'll know what excessive communication is.

36
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,002
Time could be wasted as people show up and just sort of stand

37
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:55,042
around in the incident room when they could be working on something else.

38
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,854
There could be extra stress from all these people overcrowding in. You're not

39
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:02,294
sure how to reassure all of them, and they

40
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,766
might not be sure how that they're actually going to contribute. There could

41
00:03:05,788 --> 00:03:09,846
be some anxiety about what can I do to help? There doesn't

42
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,130
seem to be anything to do to help. Tons and tons of stuff

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,570
just piling up when you have this overcrowded incident.

44
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,474
Yeah, and I think that's definitely something that we think about when we're trying

45
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:26,334
to handle an incident. And the problems that go with it is it's already

46
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,834
a stressful situation. And then there's all these other components that you just discussed,

47
00:03:29,882 --> 00:03:33,674
Emily, that are just piling on top of it. Way too much stress.

48
00:03:33,722 --> 00:03:37,330
We want to make sure that we can focus our energy on solving the problem.

49
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,406
And one quote that really resonated with me as a solutions engineer,

50
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,542
I talk with various prospects and customers on a daily basis,

51
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:48,334
and talking with an SRE manager, they were noting

52
00:03:48,382 --> 00:03:51,430
that it takes ten to 15 minutes for someone on their team

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,614
just to get caught up to speed with an incident, just the high

54
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:58,566
level information just to get started. And this seems to be a

55
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:02,422
reoccurring theme as I've talked to several different leaders

56
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:05,322
within our space, and that's just way too much time.

57
00:04:05,376 --> 00:04:08,874
And what this ultimately boils down to is on the next

58
00:04:08,912 --> 00:04:12,382
slide. You can't help if you don't know what's happening, right?

59
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:16,078
You can't just throw people at the problem. As tempting as it is,

60
00:04:16,244 --> 00:04:20,490
they need to know what's happening and how can they effectively contribute.

61
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,838
So teams not having this information who are trying to

62
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:27,346
solve this problem, as well as a lack of communication both internally and

63
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:30,942
externally, are just a few of the reasons why organizations typically

64
00:04:31,006 --> 00:04:35,042
bring too many people to the incident room. And what this

65
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:39,058
basically boils down to is a lack of classification

66
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:43,494
when it comes to incident types. And what I mean by an incident type is

67
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:47,414
what type of problem are we actually fighting right now?

68
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:51,946
And it also boils down to not having a defined escalation policy

69
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:55,926
or a cultural mindset that tasks

70
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,306
are going to be completed if you're not constantly checking up on the team.

71
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,966
We've all been there before in the past.

72
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:05,790
It's perfectly okay to have those thoughts. Other problems

73
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,054
I've personally seen from prospects include not having the right

74
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:12,606
visibility into the impact of the incident based on your

75
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:16,098
monitoring tools, or maybe not knowing who the subject matter experts to

76
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:19,714
help you solve this problem are. There are plenty of tools out there that give

77
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:23,378
your team visibility into who's on call for a

78
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:27,822
particular service or who that subject matter expert is. But oftentimes

79
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:31,254
these tools are not naturally integrated into the communication tool

80
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,006
where you may be going back and forth with the team trying to solve the

81
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:38,034
incident. And this results to excessive context

82
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:41,914
switching and as I mentioned before, stressful situation.

83
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:45,174
You don't want to add more stress, you want to alleviate that stress.

84
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:48,710
And if you're thinking, as I'm talking here, I see Emily

85
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,390
nodding. And these are all natural

86
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,834
problems that we encounter on a daily basis. You're not alone,

87
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:59,978
but there, but there are some ways that we can try to improve

88
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:03,342
in these practices by not overcrowding the incidents room.

89
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:07,250
And personally, for me, what it all kind of starts with is

90
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,294
really putting a definition around the incident type and their corresponding severity

91
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:14,974
level definitions. So what is an incident

92
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:18,294
type? You may be asking me, Nick. I have no idea what that means.

93
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,734
So some things that I've been successful in with

94
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:25,526
defining what an incident type is, is maybe it's use case based. So is

95
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:28,726
this customer impacting? Is it a security incident? Maybe it's a

96
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:32,282
planned software outage. Just being able to name a few.

97
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:35,686
Right. I've also seen several teams be successful in defining

98
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:39,542
incidents when it relates specifically to the team that's

99
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:43,626
going to be involved in solving that problem or maybe a particular service that's

100
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:47,326
being impacted. And as you start to go ahead and define these

101
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:50,590
different incident types and their corresponding severity levels,

102
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,206
you're able to do a couple of different things. Right. First and foremost, you're able

103
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:57,586
to bring the right people to help you solve this problem, as well as put

104
00:06:57,608 --> 00:07:01,026
together a framework in place as to what

105
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:04,878
should the team actually be doing. More to come on that in a few slides.

106
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:08,722
But another important distinction here is that depending on this

107
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:12,146
incident type and severity that you've captured at the start of the incident,

108
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:15,766
this is going to help you bring in different groups or teams to help you

109
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:19,434
solve that particular type of problem. And the

110
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:25,242
last note I'd like to add on this slide here is by

111
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:28,554
defining an incidents type, the severity level has just

112
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:32,240
as much impact as the type of problem. Right? So for example,

113
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,714
a severity three customer incidents versus a severity

114
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:40,250
zero. Severity three being not as prioritized,

115
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,606
versus sev zero being all hands on deck. Maybe for a sev three

116
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,970
I only need to bring in one person to help me solve the problem.

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,554
But a sev zero, I need to bring all hands on deck because this is

118
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:55,074
impacting everyone. Making sure you have those distinctions is

119
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:58,322
just as important as defining the problem itself.

120
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:01,014
So one thing I'd like to add to that is when you think about the

121
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:04,534
impact, often where companies get chipped up is they don't think about

122
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:07,878
it in terms of customer impact. One thing I

123
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:11,414
like to always say is if there's an incident in the middle of the woods

124
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:15,146
and it crashes, but it doesn't make a sound. Or if

125
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:18,474
nobody hears it, does it really make a sound? So don't just think

126
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:21,978
in terms of how much of your system is affected, but in

127
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:24,640
terms of how crucial that is to your customers.

128
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,054
So I think a common situation is, oh, we have an outage that

129
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,974
requires the most extreme reaction we can possibly have.

130
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:36,574
But if it's an outage of a service that's actually relatively unpopular,

131
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:40,194
this could actually be a lower severity than just

132
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:43,966
a mild slowdown on part of your service that absolutely everybody uses.

133
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:47,874
So having that more like nuanced understanding of how incidents

134
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:52,086
actually impact your customers and how it impacts your bottom line can

135
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:55,286
help you respond appropriately and not overreact and

136
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:59,306
overcrowd. Yeah, that's a fantastic point. Thank you so

137
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:03,370
much for adding that. And that's why these definitions and

138
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,274
severity definitions are so important when

139
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:11,374
you're trying to tackle can incident. Kind of the three words that

140
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:14,814
I can put when describing how to get started with this

141
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:18,270
is, before you start an incident, stop,

142
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,966
think and assess. Right, what type of problem are

143
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:25,502
you encountering? Who is it impacting? Just like Emily said.

144
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:29,022
And how fast does a escalation actually need to be obtained?

145
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:32,402
Because all of these are going to be contributing factors and getting the right people

146
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:34,530
to join who are going to be efficient.

147
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,962
And even though you may have this great communication

148
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:42,790
that we're discussing here about defining your incidents and

149
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,614
corresponding severity levels, you also need

150
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,374
to know how to properly escalate. If you and the team eventually hit

151
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:53,834
a roadblock, it's inevitable, to say the least, that at

152
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:57,754
some point you may not have the answer. And that's perfectly okay, right?

153
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:01,226
That's why we have a team that's here to help you. But instead of

154
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:04,574
just having that straight line of escalation where you bring in more and

155
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:07,550
more different types of people to help you solve this problem,

156
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,146
or you bring in more senior people and they get alerted

157
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:14,618
that something is on fire. Something that we recommend

158
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:18,174
is that you try to make a more diverse network

159
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:21,826
of people that you feel comfortable to reach out. And the operative word there

160
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:26,274
is comfortable because, for example, if you

161
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:30,054
need to go reach out to your vp and

162
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,926
you feel a little hesitant reaching out to them because you're like,

163
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,200
oh, they're going to think I'm not doing my job.

164
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,166
Having that kind of first layer of people who, you know, can help

165
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:43,850
you solve the problem before you escalate to that individual can definitely help

166
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,674
kind of ease that burden of saying, hey, I'm unable to finish this,

167
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:51,638
can you please step in and help me? And just as importantly,

168
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,858
we want to make sure that we reach out to people who have the bandwidth

169
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:59,146
to actually help you. So I've seen several different organizations

170
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:03,390
that I've worked with in the past where they'll go and

171
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,974
they'll have some sort of escalation policy where

172
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:09,986
they'll reach out to. Let's just say I reach out to Emily. I'm like,

173
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:13,682
Emily, I really need your help. Can you come in here? And then I check

174
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:17,378
on your calendar, and you're completely

175
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:20,306
swamped the entire day. There's no way you can help me.

176
00:11:20,408 --> 00:11:23,846
So what did I do? I added another person to the incidents room, and then

177
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:26,966
I have to go find another person who can actually help me solve this problem,

178
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:29,100
has the time to help me solve this problem.

179
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,940
So we're just piling on to the problem itself.

180
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,598
So we recently had a webinar that discussed incident command

181
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:42,278
with a couple of people from blameless and two guests from other companies.

182
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:45,502
And one of them described a policy where they had

183
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,782
incident buddies that is kind of like

184
00:11:48,836 --> 00:11:53,086
always the first person you can reach out to just for a sanity check

185
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:57,218
to help give you confidence to escalation further. Because it

186
00:11:57,224 --> 00:12:00,802
is a really human thing. We can't overlook the human qualities of being

187
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:04,622
nervous to contact people and escalate being uncertain.

188
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:08,514
And that's why often we end up with these really strict escalation

189
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,778
policies that are very linear, very hierarchical,

190
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:15,062
but in the end, maybe aren't that effective. So instead,

191
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:18,482
we encourage you to kind of lean into this human aspect

192
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:22,154
and really think about who do I work well with? Who do I

193
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:26,026
know that actually really knows this subject matter? Who can

194
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:29,738
I count on to help explain this problem to me and walk me through it?

195
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:33,790
And then you can have this kind of more personal, adaptive, on call relationship

196
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,066
that isn't just swarming the incident with as many senior

197
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:40,474
people as you can get. Yeah, that's a fantastic

198
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:44,286
point. And something that resonates to me personally is that whole idea of the

199
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:47,906
sanity check, right? Especially as you're in there fighting a particular

200
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:51,646
problem and you've tried something three times and it's

201
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:54,930
not working, and you're like, I know this is supposed to be working.

202
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,042
Just getting that extra layer of eyes on it, someone that you feel comfortable

203
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:02,678
taking a look at it and not kind of roasting you

204
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:05,990
that you're doing the wrong thing is super important, right.

205
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,090
Because that's going to move you towards a escalation at a much quicker pace

206
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,074
than if you kind of keep it to yourself and continue to try something over

207
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:18,406
and over. And what this really kind of nails

208
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:21,766
down to is get just the right people who can contribute

209
00:13:21,798 --> 00:13:25,502
right away and escalate strategically only if you have to,

210
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:29,086
but if you have to, having some of these ideas that we talked about today

211
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:33,134
will definitely help in that process. And as

212
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:37,122
you're bringing in more people into the incident room, the slack channel,

213
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:40,834
the teams channel, wherever you're managing incidents today,

214
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:44,514
it's just as important for these people to know why they're being

215
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:48,422
called into the incident room as being involved within

216
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:51,990
the incident. So defining these incident roles and

217
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,446
tasks can help with this. Right. So what are

218
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:59,298
some examples of different incident roles that I've seen be successful?

219
00:13:59,394 --> 00:14:03,078
The incident commander, as an example, as Emily mentioned beforehand,

220
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:06,346
that's usually the person that's in charge of facilitating and moving the

221
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,866
incident forward towards a resolution, kind of making sure

222
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:13,502
everything's on track. Communications lead is another big one,

223
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:17,086
because most organizations, communication is

224
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:21,086
usually a broken process, and one of the reasons why we're having this conversation here

225
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:25,074
today, and that role is typically in charge of facilitating both

226
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:29,330
internal and external forms of communication to different stakeholders.

227
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,282
And the last one I'd like to note, too, is some kind of

228
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:36,638
technical or engineering lead. So that's typically the person that's

229
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:39,778
there to help you try and solve the problem from a technical standpoint.

230
00:14:39,874 --> 00:14:43,554
So a combination of those three roles is very powerful

231
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:47,446
to make sure that there are particular lanes of focus in order

232
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:50,866
to help you try and drive towards resolution of the incident quicker.

233
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:54,314
And I think this really alleviates one of the big fears that we talked about

234
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,686
earlier, is that people start to get paranoid that maybe something won't

235
00:14:57,718 --> 00:15:01,454
get covered, that some part of the response process will fall

236
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:04,350
through the cracks. Maybe someone won't get informed,

237
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,446
maybe some due diligence around recording things won't get done.

238
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:12,218
So if you have these roles and these checklists already defined,

239
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:15,954
people will be confident. Oh, I know there's enough people in there to

240
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:19,346
handle communications and to handle recording and

241
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:22,514
to handle leading up the technical front,

242
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:26,326
and they won't have that anxiety that might make them want to jump in or

243
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:30,262
call in a bunch of extra people. Yeah, that's a

244
00:15:30,316 --> 00:15:33,654
super important note to mention there,

245
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:35,880
and thank you so much for bringing that up.

246
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,926
Oftentimes, people come into the instant room because they feel like

247
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:43,642
they need to get an answer quicker. But one of the kind of

248
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,066
highlight moments that I'm going to mention here is that sometimes you just

249
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:50,710
have to trust the process. So in order to have.

250
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,554
Establishing these different roles and tasks, making sure that someone that's

251
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:57,806
qualified to move the incident forward

252
00:15:57,908 --> 00:16:01,386
based on those roles and the tasks that they're provided

253
00:16:01,578 --> 00:16:05,198
is super important. And to me, it really boils

254
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,734
down to three key aspects of roles

255
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:12,802
and tasks. Help with accountability, right? So if

256
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:16,882
sales needed to get an update for this particular incident type and severity,

257
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:20,422
the communications lead is held accountable to make sure that they're getting

258
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:24,294
that update. Consistency in the incident process is something

259
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:27,830
that's just as important, right. As you're building

260
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,522
out your kind of initiative to drive towards

261
00:16:31,596 --> 00:16:35,046
Sre as a whole, you need to make sure that you're following

262
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,506
the process so you can use it as an opportunity to learn. If you

263
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:42,366
don't follow the process the way it's been built today, you're not going to be

264
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:45,882
able to make those gradual changes that will make your incident

265
00:16:45,946 --> 00:16:49,530
management process more efficient. And then lastly,

266
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,086
roles and tasks help with communication. And as I

267
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:57,230
mentioned before, that's one of the reasons why we're here today as the incident

268
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,542
evolves, communicate, period.

269
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,274
Right? You want to make sure that you get the word out to as many

270
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:07,458
stakeholders as you can, or more specifically,

271
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:10,918
those who need to be notified. Right? We recommend trying to

272
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:14,674
get a system in place to automatically deliver these updates to relevant

273
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:17,814
stakeholders, customers, management, et cetera.

274
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:21,258
But specifically, people need to know things

275
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:25,098
immediately, and other people only need to know

276
00:17:25,264 --> 00:17:29,146
what's happening for high level outcomes. Right? So make

277
00:17:29,168 --> 00:17:32,574
sure that you differentiate these different groups and respond to them

278
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:36,334
accordingly. But at the same time, having these

279
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:39,914
automated communications in place, you also need to have some sort of method

280
00:17:39,962 --> 00:17:43,838
to send out ad hoc forms of communication through the

281
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:47,074
communication tool that you're using or being able to send.

282
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:51,214
But emails or text messages, status page updates,

283
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:54,786
kind of on the fly. So the communication of those two are

284
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:58,162
very important. What is one of the kind of main

285
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:02,006
areas that you've seen, Emily, in terms of communication that can kind of

286
00:18:02,028 --> 00:18:05,254
be improved upon based on your experience? Well, I think something that

287
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,822
happens very often is that higher rungs of management will get anxious

288
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:12,890
during incidents. They'll start to wonder, how are things progressing?

289
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,418
Have they considered this? What messaging can I take

290
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:20,410
to our other stakeholders, to our board, to our customers?

291
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,222
And you start getting these layers of minimal management, jumping into the incident without

292
00:18:24,276 --> 00:18:27,854
really being able to contribute a whole lot and sometimes putting a lot of

293
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:32,106
pressure on the engineers who are trying to focus to give them these answers.

294
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:35,874
So I think proactiveness is really, really key here.

295
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:39,774
And like you said, having automatic systems set up to deliver

296
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:43,954
messages when status changes or when different things progress is really

297
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:47,846
great because then nobody has to kind of lift their head up off the

298
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:51,346
desk. They can stay focused in on the applications

299
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:54,582
they need to be in and not have to worry about sending off an email

300
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:58,962
or whatever. I think really communication

301
00:18:59,026 --> 00:19:02,730
should be something that alleviates these sorts of concerns,

302
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:06,874
that gives them confidence in the process and the system so that they can

303
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:10,494
focus on what they need to do, knowing that the incident is being taken care

304
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:14,302
of. So it's important to kind of walk the line

305
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:17,710
between personally addressing whatever

306
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,182
might be concerning these other stakeholders and

307
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:25,474
also having something really fluid and automatic that

308
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:29,086
doesn't take people out of their tasks. So it's

309
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:32,594
a difficult process to pin down. But with good tooling and with

310
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:35,982
having somebody focused on this sort of communication aspect,

311
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:39,990
you can really alleviate a lot of the burden and a lot of the overcrowding.

312
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,846
Yeah, 100%. And if any of you out there

313
00:19:43,868 --> 00:19:47,880
are listening to this and you're thinking that, oh, can this sounds like a big

314
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,820
change or we don't have any of this in place today,

315
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,514
like I mentioned earlier, you're not alone out there.

316
00:19:55,552 --> 00:19:59,306
Right? This is all natural to be feeling and it's a gradual change. And that

317
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:03,170
kind of beats us into our final couple of slides here of listening

318
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,606
to everything that you've talked about today. What will you need to remember and

319
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:10,378
to start? Communication doesn't need to be limited to that particular role.

320
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:14,018
Right. The communications lead who their job is to send information

321
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:17,634
but about the incident to those key stakeholders. But as

322
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:21,742
someone that's involved in solving the problem at hand, don't be afraid

323
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:25,726
to mark something as important when communicating. The process shouldn't

324
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,254
be rigid, but it should be a foundation that you can work on top

325
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:33,366
of, for example, being able to mark something that

326
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:36,386
is a key finding within Slack or Microsoft Teams.

327
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:40,374
As you're in the incident room, you're troubleshooting as important.

328
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,022
I see organizations gain benefit from this on a daily basis.

329
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:47,706
Adding those key pieces of conversation to your incident timeline so

330
00:20:47,728 --> 00:20:50,666
you can go back and take a look at what was important for helping you

331
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:54,126
solve that problem is just as important. The worst thing

332
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:57,886
you could do there is not market and then it

333
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:01,566
may have gone unturned. Right? Or maybe that was the

334
00:21:01,588 --> 00:21:05,314
solution to the problem. Mark it down as important and let

335
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:08,830
those key contribute with incident roles, handle their tasks.

336
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,510
So a great example of this, collecting relevant comments

337
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,194
from the Slack channel to document in the incident timeline is a great

338
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:19,494
example of something the commander would do. Hey, I'm scrolling through.

339
00:21:19,532 --> 00:21:22,470
I'm seeing all this kind of chat back and forth,

340
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,738
is this relevant? Someone marked it as relevant. Being able to efficiently,

341
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:30,554
for example, within slack toggle, yes or no,

342
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:34,486
is this important or not? Is something that a commander

343
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:38,138
would technically be in charge of doing. Having some

344
00:21:38,144 --> 00:21:41,942
of these elements that we discussed today incorporated into your incident management

345
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:45,486
process will help you cut through the noise and drive towards resolution at

346
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:49,226
a much quicker pace. This is cultural change, and it's

347
00:21:49,258 --> 00:21:53,294
a communication that we're trying to build. So make sure you're trusting that process.

348
00:21:53,492 --> 00:21:57,362
The retrospective or the post incident analysis is a great

349
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,546
way of driving that cultural change. So being able

350
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:03,742
to ask your team after the incident has been completed,

351
00:22:03,886 --> 00:22:07,442
everybody's tired, they're ready to go home for the day. But making

352
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:11,320
sure that you still get the answers to some key questions, like,

353
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,122
did you have the right team automatically added to the incident

354
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:18,746
channel to help you troubleshoot that problem? Or did you feel like

355
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:21,914
you had the resources you needed in order to start addressing that

356
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,434
issue? Or were the

357
00:22:25,472 --> 00:22:29,798
right individuals or channels automatically sent communication

358
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:33,998
when the incident was created? These are just a couple questions that

359
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:38,174
I've seen kind of help in that cultural adoption. Emily, is there

360
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:41,694
any particular notes that you have when it comes to kind of

361
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:44,110
like this cultural foundation?

362
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,194
So one thing I want to point out is when we're talking about this idea

363
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:51,154
of learning from incidents and the retrospectives and such,

364
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:54,802
I think it really is an often situation where

365
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:58,594
people will jump into the incidents room because they want to know what's going

366
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:02,406
on. And like you said, it's another instance where they have to be able

367
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:05,446
to trust the process that if they think, oh,

368
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:09,110
I need to be there because otherwise I'll have no clue what ended up happening,

369
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,100
no clue what the resolution was, and I could run into the same problem later.

370
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:17,018
That's not the best reason to actually be involved in an incident and be in

371
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:20,474
the response room. Instead, they should trust that, oh, someone is

372
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:24,110
recording what's important. There will be a document that's made.

373
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,358
I will be able to go back and learn what I

374
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,814
need to from this. Like you say, yeah, it's all but

375
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:35,086
trusting the process and process isn't something that gets built overnight.

376
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:39,726
You really do need a cultural foundation that's

377
00:23:39,758 --> 00:23:43,262
built around that trust that gives people confidence,

378
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:46,520
oh, if we keep doing this, the process will get better and better.

379
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,082
And I think a major thing is this idea of kind of psychological

380
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:55,638
safety that you're not going to get

381
00:23:55,724 --> 00:23:59,222
punished for screwing up the process,

382
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,838
whether that be, oops, I accidentally invited

383
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:06,330
the entire development team for this project because I was freaking out.

384
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,374
You know what? That's okay. It's probably going to cause some problems in the incident,

385
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:13,020
but it's not going to be the end of the world. It's a learning experience.

386
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,654
And similarly, if you see an incident happening and you see

387
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:20,366
that there's some people working in it to have the psychological safety to

388
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:23,582
say, you know what? I wasn't called on this.

389
00:24:23,636 --> 00:24:26,894
I wasn't alerted. I'm maybe a little concerned,

390
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:30,114
I'm a little curious, but I'll trust the system and I can stay

391
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,742
out. And to know that you're never going to get reprimanded

392
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,380
and be told, hey, why didn't you join? Why didn't you try to help?

393
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,986
So just this culture of feeling safe, because you're

394
00:24:42,018 --> 00:24:45,378
trusting in the process and you're trusting in a culture where you're

395
00:24:45,394 --> 00:24:49,014
not going to get blamed, you're not going to be given at fault, but where

396
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:53,100
all these errors will just be learning opportunities to improve the process.

397
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,546
It's okay to fail at this stuff. It's okay to have a

398
00:24:57,568 --> 00:25:01,518
system that doesn't work right away. It's all about iterating and learning

399
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:04,160
and understanding how you can get better in the future.

400
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,850
Yeah, 100%. That's super powerful.

401
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,534
And there was kind of two key takeaways that

402
00:25:11,572 --> 00:25:14,080
really resonated with me is that,

403
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:18,370
as I mentioned before, the worst thing you could do is not

404
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,934
suggest something right when you're popping

405
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:25,300
in or you've been assigned a role and you have an idea,

406
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,398
you may not know that it's the answer, but it could be the answer.

407
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:32,758
Jotting that down and having that psychological safety to do so

408
00:25:32,844 --> 00:25:36,678
is the step one. Because if you don't feel comfortable putting that information

409
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:41,382
down, you may not overturn

410
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:44,682
what the solution actually was. So that's super

411
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:47,930
important. And I think the other key piece

412
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,614
that really resonated with what you said was that

413
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:54,798
you want your employees to feel heard, right?

414
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:59,162
So the retrospective or the post incident analysis

415
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:02,814
is a great way for your employees to feel heard after they

416
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:05,620
spent that energy fighting the problem.

417
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,258
If there's any changes that need to be made in your incident management process

418
00:26:10,344 --> 00:26:14,334
or these communication workflows that you've set up, the team that was battling

419
00:26:14,382 --> 00:26:18,594
the incident will be the first line of information to streamline your incident management

420
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:22,294
process as a whole. And that's where that iterative process really

421
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,462
kicks in and making those gradual changes over time.

422
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:28,866
So that process makes everyone feel more included,

423
00:26:28,978 --> 00:26:32,438
heard, and it's moving towards a resolution at a

424
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:35,538
quicker, um,

425
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:39,350
that's all I got here. Emily, is there anything else you'd like to add?

426
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,360
I'd like to just thank everybody for coming today and listening to our talk.

427
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,546
Yeah. Thank you so much for listening. We hope that we've convinced

428
00:26:47,578 --> 00:26:51,566
you that sometimes a lean, focused team can beat out a

429
00:26:51,588 --> 00:26:55,294
large all hands on deck scenario. And we hope

430
00:26:55,412 --> 00:26:58,080
we gave you some tips on how to move towards that.

431
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,014
Awesome. All right. Thank you all so much. Thank you so much. Have a great

432
00:27:02,052 --> 00:27:02,140
day.
