00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,134
Hello guys. I'm here to talk with

2
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:34,022
you about Pyto as an

3
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,410
oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop,

4
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:41,046
oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop, oop,

5
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:43,960
oop, oop,

6
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,658
oop, oop, oop, oop. Teaching tool

7
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:53,134
in the information to thank you for the opportunity for

8
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:56,686
this opportunity to talk a little bit about education.

9
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,950
To talk a little bit about Python.

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,822
So, I've been teaching

11
00:01:03,886 --> 00:01:07,086
since 2010 here in Brazil

12
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:10,930
in a small university called wengi.

13
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,862
I teach at information systems

14
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:19,282
course. I live in a small town named

15
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:21,190
Ituyutaba.

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,986
Well, during my master's

17
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,178
degree, I studied a little

18
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:32,650
about gamification and how

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,610
we can use these mechanics of gamifications,

20
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,594
these mechanics that is used in games,

21
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:47,486
and how we can use this in other ways.

22
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:51,438
For example, in education, how can we

23
00:01:51,604 --> 00:01:55,854
teach in a better way using games

24
00:01:55,902 --> 00:01:59,620
mechanics? So, in other words,

25
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,634
the concern of teaching and how

26
00:02:03,752 --> 00:02:07,638
to teach better, how to teach in a

27
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:11,942
profitable way for students has always

28
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:15,110
been in my goals as a teacher.

29
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,726
Of course, English is not my main language,

30
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:24,234
so I apologize in advance if I make any

31
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:27,020
mistakes. Well,

32
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,054
our goal is to share the

33
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:38,606
experience of using the Python language to teach

34
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:43,182
objectoriented programming to difficult found pedagogical

35
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,814
approach that I used exercise practice

36
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:50,466
performed with our students. This is

37
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:55,846
our goal here, to share with you a

38
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:59,906
little experience of what I've

39
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,302
been doing to teach in a better way. We will

40
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:07,534
talk a little about the difficulties we encountered,

41
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:11,740
how we conduct all this work with our students,

42
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,594
and how we are

43
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:20,490
always aiming on real world activities.

44
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,750
Well, one of the biggest problems

45
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,910
found here in Brazil in technology courses,

46
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,298
mainly in technology course, is the high level of

47
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:38,866
evasion. Many students, a lot

48
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:42,302
of students of eight, start studying

49
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:45,910
computer science or any other course

50
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,640
in this area, for example,

51
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,920
system information.

52
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,326
But they end up being disappointed by

53
00:03:56,348 --> 00:04:00,460
the difficulties found on the course

54
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,460
on the first year, on the second year.

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,086
Here in our country, here in Brazil.

56
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:12,080
Unfortunately, the early years of school

57
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,134
and what we here call high school do

58
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:20,858
not provide a strong foundation in math,

59
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,498
for example, in other areas too,

60
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,170
but specifically in math,

61
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,074
the students don't have a strong

62
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:35,070
foundation. And this way,

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,110
many students arrive here in the college with

64
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,078
difficult in math and logical thinking,

65
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:45,910
with difficult also in writing.

66
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,106
So these lead a lot of students.

67
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:54,074
This lead many students to drop out or

68
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:57,494
changing curse to a different curse that don't

69
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,910
have a strong emphasis in math,

70
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,400
just in the first few months of study.

71
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:09,440
Well, here we have, for example,

72
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,050
some data taken from a survey carried out

73
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,598
here in Brazil, that shows a drop

74
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:20,820
rate of 69%

75
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,866
among technology curses students. This is

76
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:27,800
a high number. This is a high number.

77
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,806
Even more considering the number of slots available

78
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:37,000
for work here in Brazil and around the world. With tech,

79
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,970
there are a lot of slots. There are a lot of

80
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,778
opportunities on work

81
00:05:44,864 --> 00:05:49,514
careers to work with technology here

82
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:53,658
in Brazil and all around the world. But despite

83
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,926
this, even considering this,

84
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,680
our students are dropping out.

85
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,530
So it's also worth remembering that

86
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,834
with the pandemic that we are living, still living right

87
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:13,566
now, in 2022, many vacancies

88
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:17,298
that previously existed only in large

89
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:21,558
shopping centers, in large

90
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:25,366
centers like Sao Paulo, became remote work.

91
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:29,674
A lot of companies that in

92
00:06:29,712 --> 00:06:33,402
the past used to have slots available

93
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:35,210
just on their cities,

94
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,374
we have now remote work or work

95
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:45,262
from home. As a result, the number of slots available

96
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:49,754
to people who live in small towns like minas has increased

97
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:53,554
significantly. Basically, it's possible to

98
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:56,910
work in any company in the country, here in Brazil,

99
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,354
or around the world. And even with

100
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:04,142
the end of pandemic, most of these slots

101
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,650
will remain remote.

102
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,126
A real transformation has taken place in the

103
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:12,200
labor market.

104
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,620
Here again, we have another research.

105
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,918
Sorry, it's written in Portuguese,

106
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:26,730
but this research is showing that the

107
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,086
greatest difficulty for students in subjects

108
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:33,470
involving logic and programming,

109
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,006
just to make the most of the time, I want to read it all.

110
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:40,414
By the way, it's also in Portuguese, but I will

111
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:44,530
supply all sources in the presentation and

112
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,770
will be published on the speaker deck after our

113
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,460
talk.

114
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,040
Ah, one more survey here,

115
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,226
this is another from 2018,

116
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:06,502
also shows academic performance as a possible

117
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,978
source of evasion from the curses. Of course,

118
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:13,446
there are many factors. Of course there are many factors,

119
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:17,306
such as financial. We have also a

120
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:20,878
lot of students that have to work

121
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:24,222
during the day to support themselves,

122
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:27,790
to support their families.

123
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,640
Even the location where they stud,

124
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,314
most of times are far from the university, far from the college.

125
00:08:37,512 --> 00:08:41,326
But it's also worth remembering that the difficults,

126
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:44,180
if logic and math are there,

127
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,962
they are always there. And the scheduling.

128
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:52,310
And the scheduling is an important factor.

129
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,518
Well, all of us in the field

130
00:08:56,604 --> 00:09:01,290
of programming technology know that it

131
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,540
always starts with the hello word.

132
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,710
Whether it was done in the past, in Clipper,

133
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,498
in basic, Delphi,

134
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:15,754
Java, or python. It turns

135
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:19,518
out that for years, for many years

136
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,910
here in Brazil, college teachers,

137
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,600
professors use c.

138
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,662
They always, in the past, used also

139
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:33,690
Java as the first contact language

140
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,526
for students. And by

141
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:40,680
the way, part of the problem,

142
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,000
maybe the main problem, is here,

143
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,554
these two code snippets have the

144
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:56,426
same goal. Here we have the same goal to

145
00:09:56,448 --> 00:10:00,134
make the hello word example for those who have

146
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:04,030
never had contact with programming. Which of

147
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,110
these, the first one or the second one is

148
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,286
easier to understand? The first piece of code that

149
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,750
you can see here above,

150
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,074
if I need to teach these students, I have

151
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:24,180
to teach them what is a class,

152
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,120
what is the meaning of the void word,

153
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,798
why we have a main word

154
00:10:31,884 --> 00:10:35,110
here, and what is a string

155
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,214
in the Python code, everything is more

156
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:44,702
direct. We have a less verbosed

157
00:10:44,786 --> 00:10:48,698
code and therefore easier for the student to understand.

158
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:52,702
It's also easy to teach

159
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:56,286
them why this code is here,

160
00:10:56,468 --> 00:11:00,320
why we have print, and why

161
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,770
this is nipped of code. This way it's easier.

162
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,030
I really like this phrase

163
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,800
because it focuses on experience.

164
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,702
In other words, to learn you

165
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:25,558
need to effectively do and

166
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:29,690
experiment. There is no

167
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,146
easy way to learn, just reading a

168
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:37,354
book for examples. You can't clear how

169
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:41,230
to program just reading, you can't learn

170
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,120
how to program. Just listen to somebody

171
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,870
give a talk about programming, about classes,

172
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,858
about how to make a program

173
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:57,582
that reads a data set on an SK lite,

174
00:11:57,646 --> 00:11:59,140
for example. No,

175
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,260
we have to actively experience,

176
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,350
we have to

177
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,974
training a lot to make a practice on

178
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:16,790
daily and a weekly basis.

179
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,610
Of course, we all know that

180
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,146
in the university, the university itself

181
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:28,650
is based on theoretical knowledge,

182
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,882
but it is also important in this preparation

183
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:37,934
of career for the study of technology course that

184
00:12:37,972 --> 00:12:41,280
we really focus on the practical part

185
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:46,690
precisely for this reason, experimentation and

186
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,274
practicing both of them is

187
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,060
a fundamental part of learning,

188
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,454
mainly on programming. So basically on

189
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:02,354
this scenario, basically on these difficults,

190
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:05,926
found the objective of the work.

191
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,590
The objective of my work in the past three,

192
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,030
four years ago, when I began to teach object

193
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,126
oriented programming, programming was to develop

194
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:19,350
a pedagogical approach,

195
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,710
a way that

196
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,758
would make easy to the

197
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:31,646
student learning. Starting always

198
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:36,526
started on a simple way and gradually increasing

199
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:40,770
the challenge and gradually increasing

200
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,638
the involvement, making it hard on

201
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:48,630
small steps.

202
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,670
So the first

203
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,178
part about lectures, we know that in

204
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:02,902
the university we have a lot of teachers,

205
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,774
a lot of professors with extensive academic

206
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:07,610
careers,

207
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,334
and we have teachers also that have work

208
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,440
experience in the technology field.

209
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,742
We have teachers that have experience in

210
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:25,150
programming and project management,

211
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,300
working on an it company.

212
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,986
This is very, very nice. And this makes

213
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:35,814
the difference to the students because we are

214
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:39,382
able to work on a more

215
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:44,390
practical class aimed at a professional development.

216
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,230
It's often remembering also that the teacher

217
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,690
is always, and the teacher is still the

218
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,820
central role in the teaching and learning process.

219
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,686
We have books, we have programming, we have lecture,

220
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:03,920
we have a student with a fox to learn.

221
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,430
But the main subject,

222
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:13,410
the central role on this process of

223
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,090
teaching and learning is the teacher.

224
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,940
So the

225
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,006
first step we must found a

226
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:28,760
way that is easy to get started.

227
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,822
Instead of focusing on a process where the

228
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:38,140
student would have to install IDE

229
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,518
libraries, MySQL and the other software

230
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:46,438
just to start developing, we chose

231
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:50,478
to use an online tool that allows the student

232
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:54,766
from the first minutes of the class to start working

233
00:15:54,868 --> 00:16:01,214
with that language. So we

234
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:05,438
chose to use repo software that allows

235
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:09,294
the student to work from anywhere. Start development

236
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:13,250
almost immediately. You can also start programming at

237
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,350
home on your lunchtime

238
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,666
and then access your entire portfolio

239
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:24,998
from college. We always

240
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,940
encourage students to keep their codes on this platform

241
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,718
and solve all activity, all lists of exercises

242
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:37,866
to make all their practices using

243
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:41,754
ripple using the repo software. So I

244
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:47,534
do not work at repo, but it's a

245
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,200
great tool to teach.

246
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,518
So on the right side we have the python interpreter,

247
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:59,058
and on left side we have the code. Here is

248
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,290
one of the first exercise lists.

249
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,990
The second point that we are always aiming is

250
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,950
to have a clear problem definition.

251
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,902
We notice that many times these students

252
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,500
start trying to solve certain problem, started trying

253
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,554
to program without even having

254
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,866
understood all that needs to

255
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:33,614
be done. They even understanding what

256
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,182
they have to do. And just no, I have to program, I have to start

257
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:41,502
typing. No. The most important step here is

258
00:17:41,556 --> 00:17:46,100
to make the proposal problem easy to understand.

259
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,538
They must really know, they must really

260
00:17:51,624 --> 00:17:54,740
understand what they have to do.

261
00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,086
And the exercise lists are also a start with

262
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:03,350
very, very basic and simple activities.

263
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,858
Here, for example, we are talking about

264
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:12,474
an activity where we start with the

265
00:18:12,512 --> 00:18:15,820
first list, a program to add two numbers,

266
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,466
just this, you get one number,

267
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:22,750
you get another number, a second number,

268
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,974
and you must sum them. There we

269
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:31,246
go. On the next exercise, the number two,

270
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:35,650
where we have to convert meters to millimeters.

271
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,742
This is also an easy task.

272
00:18:41,806 --> 00:18:45,222
It's also an easy exercise. But we are

273
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:48,280
increasing the difficult step by steps.

274
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,440
Because the third point,

275
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,800
this is increasing difficult.

276
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,862
In the beginning is very easy. In the beginning it's very easy.

277
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:04,182
Yes, it is easy, but we always work with activities with increasing

278
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:07,754
difficulty in order to always keep the

279
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:12,074
challenging. This is a kind of mechanic

280
00:19:12,122 --> 00:19:15,854
from gamification. I cannot work only with

281
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:19,790
his exercise because the student will

282
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,186
lose his motivation. At the same time,

283
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,706
if I create something extremely demanding at

284
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:30,466
the beginning, the chance of giving up is very

285
00:19:30,568 --> 00:19:34,466
high. So the increasing difficult

286
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:38,626
is the point. We start easily.

287
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:42,562
We always increase in the difficult. The first exercise

288
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:45,400
in python is to add two numbers, just this.

289
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,994
But in the end we will develop a crude create,

290
00:19:50,032 --> 00:19:52,460
retrieve, update, delete code.

291
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,194
Here, for example, we have some exercise with Heidegger.

292
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:03,902
Difficult. They are in Portuguese, but basically we are

293
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:08,410
asking for some complexes, exercises, tasks involving

294
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,050
time, monetary values, temperature,

295
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,074
conversions and some others. With each new list

296
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:18,978
of exercise, the difficult increases. There are total

297
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:23,202
of nine exercise lists. I just want to point out

298
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:26,614
that this same approach that

299
00:20:26,652 --> 00:20:32,262
we use for teaching programming, we are

300
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,078
using the same approach to teach, for example,

301
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:39,094
SQL. It's not necessary

302
00:20:39,142 --> 00:20:42,826
to install anything. We are using just

303
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:47,110
an online tool. We are using just increasing

304
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,100
difficult, starting small step by step.

305
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,710
The four point is collaborative work.

306
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,258
Activities are not developed individually.

307
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:03,300
Students always work in groups, they are always

308
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,700
working and even encouraged to research,

309
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,194
to google it, to talk about activities and

310
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:15,910
discuss the best solutions with their colleagues.

311
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,320
Always collaborative work.

312
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,130
When they go to work on development

313
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,898
team on an IT company, they will

314
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,138
always work with you, other people, they will always

315
00:21:34,304 --> 00:21:37,834
do pair programming and they will ask

316
00:21:37,872 --> 00:21:41,278
a question when they are not understanding something.

317
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:44,846
That's why here in the college there

318
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:49,134
is no problem on working that way. Here they

319
00:21:49,172 --> 00:21:52,794
can discuss, they can talk, they can research,

320
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,620
they can Google, no problem.

321
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,010
So we always work together

322
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,254
using online tools and always with teacher

323
00:22:06,302 --> 00:22:10,694
supervision. Teacher follow up is important, it's very important.

324
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:14,214
Students look for solutions, but we as

325
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,538
teachers must always guide their

326
00:22:17,644 --> 00:22:18,300
work.

327
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,922
The next point that we have on this

328
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,746
pedagogical approach is to as

329
00:22:28,768 --> 00:22:32,882
far as possible, we chose to work with tools and the practices

330
00:22:32,966 --> 00:22:35,920
that are used in companies around the world.

331
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,178
So lattice

332
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:44,798
is a brazilian system where students register

333
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:48,114
their data as researchers and academic life.

334
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:52,690
It's important to keep use it by those who want to

335
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,198
in the future do a master degree or

336
00:22:56,284 --> 00:22:59,640
a PhD. And of course

337
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,226
we ask that they also always published

338
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:09,222
their code to repose stories on GitHub.

339
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:12,810
So everyone is encouraged to use

340
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,698
GitHub from the first week. Guys, drink your

341
00:23:16,704 --> 00:23:17,900
water. Always.

342
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,950
So all students created GitHub accounts.

343
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,126
A lot of people didn't know how to use it, but we went through a

344
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:32,650
process of encouraging a little by little.

345
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,500
And all the teachers on the college do the same.

346
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,858
Multidisciplinary our goal was to teach object

347
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:47,718
oriented programming. That's it. This was clear from the start.

348
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:51,574
But our goal is also to get as possible to

349
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:55,910
what happened when students start to work with development on IT

350
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,766
company IT team. We know that in addition to a language,

351
00:23:59,878 --> 00:24:03,606
it involves knowledge of database, project management,

352
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:07,082
agile, software engineering. We use

353
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:08,860
software engineering, for example,

354
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,242
to understand the scope and the requirements,

355
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:17,710
the database we store and the project managed to track development.

356
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,118
So that's the challenge.

357
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:27,698
Find a way to mix all these concepts and deliver something.

358
00:24:27,784 --> 00:24:31,774
In the end. Our goal is always in the end to deliver

359
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:35,560
the software running and serve the customer.

360
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:39,880
But for that to happen,

361
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,600
just my cam.

362
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,490
But for that to happen there is a lot of work

363
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,814
behind the scenes. After initial concepts

364
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:55,194
and list of exercise with primary concepts, we move

365
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:58,970
on to some more practical examples

366
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,506
and the last is all

367
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:08,062
open and publish it all source code

368
00:25:08,116 --> 00:25:11,482
for activities available on GitHub. The exercise

369
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:15,322
lists and slides are also there. The classes

370
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:19,506
were recorded and made available through YouTube channel.

371
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:23,218
The most interesting is that later I published a post

372
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:27,462
on my blog explaining this entire process and

373
00:25:27,516 --> 00:25:31,302
a few weeks later I received emails from students asking for help

374
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:36,246
with activities and exercise. Students from another

375
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:40,454
states here in Brazil. That's this. They effectively

376
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,390
followed the classes recorded on YouTube,

377
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,010
available on YouTube and performed the exercise.

378
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,862
People from other cities, from other states who studied at the other

379
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:56,494
college also followed this

380
00:25:56,532 --> 00:26:00,398
project and this was very

381
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:01,550
rewarding.

382
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,030
We had recorded lessons and some live lessons

383
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,858
too and these classes were also available

384
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:15,874
on YouTube. The pandemic forced us

385
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:19,782
to adapt our process and the way of learning and the way of

386
00:26:19,836 --> 00:26:23,734
working, the way of teaching. But in the end it seems that

387
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:27,110
we management. We extracted the best of

388
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,040
this situation.

389
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,178
This is the page where I published on the blog and had

390
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:38,986
a lot of visits. Several people asking help

391
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,950
and using our proposal.

392
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,422
This is one of the YouTube lists from the last year.

393
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:50,778
There are many classes divided by section,

394
00:26:50,874 --> 00:26:52,430
organized by sections.

395
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,838
One of the intermediate exercises develop a tic tac

396
00:26:57,854 --> 00:27:02,302
toe. Here in Brazil we call Jogu d'velia.

397
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:06,274
There is no intelligence here in computer decisions,

398
00:27:06,402 --> 00:27:10,454
only a

399
00:27:10,492 --> 00:27:14,754
position, but even it required

400
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:19,130
to use the vectors, conditionals and the other language resources.

401
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,822
This is another activity aiming to use a brazilian

402
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:31,114
public web server to search exchanged

403
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:35,338
quotes. This activity was simple consultation

404
00:27:35,434 --> 00:27:38,926
only. But in the final activity, later in

405
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,818
this type of query you'll be using in other contexts.

406
00:27:41,914 --> 00:27:45,538
So here we are consuming using

407
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,940
a web service, a public web service.

408
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:55,336
So this

409
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:58,636
is a crud why it

410
00:27:58,658 --> 00:28:02,588
is used? It's used to create, retrieve data,

411
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:05,100
update or delete.

412
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,550
I am always saying that

413
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,728
building a crude is a way to show

414
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:17,856
proficient in a technology, in a language by joining a

415
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:21,228
programming language with a database system and be

416
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:23,956
able to being able to record,

417
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:27,664
to retrieve information, to list, to update

418
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:31,152
the data they studied. We have the basic

419
00:28:31,216 --> 00:28:33,620
knowledge of data manipulation.

420
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,810
So that's it.

421
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,124
Here we have some books. My books are

422
00:28:48,162 --> 00:28:50,620
available on Amazon.

423
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,340
We have four books.

424
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,932
And here

425
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,632
is my website where I have all

426
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:03,440
my network,

427
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,436
Twitter, LinkedIn,

428
00:29:07,628 --> 00:29:11,452
GitHub, YouTube channel and

429
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:15,124
that's it. Our main point here

430
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:18,980
was to share with you all our

431
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,628
work as a teacher where we use a

432
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:25,992
lot of python to teach her in a better

433
00:29:26,126 --> 00:29:30,008
way. So our main point here in this talk

434
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:34,388
was education, but education with Python

435
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:38,908
always trying to solve the problem using

436
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:42,540
a professional approach,

437
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,908
using tools that are always

438
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:51,330
used in it teams, it companies.

439
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,032
That's it. I would like to thank

440
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:59,584
you again for the opportunity to

441
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:03,316
talk here at Conf fourty two, and thank you for

442
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:06,512
your patience to be listening

443
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:10,500
me and sorry for any mistake I made in this

444
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,876
process, because English is not my main

445
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:18,508
language. That's it. My name is Chiago Basiochi

446
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:22,632
and I'm here to help you if you need any

447
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:26,750
doubts, if you have any questions,

448
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,990
please reach me out.

449
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,460
We can share more knowledge, we can

450
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,236
learn with each other, and especially to

451
00:30:38,258 --> 00:30:42,188
that teachers, college teachers, school teachers

452
00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:46,690
that have some help. Our main

453
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,170
objective, our focus is to always

454
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,960
encourage the use of gamification mechanics,

455
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,296
encourage the use of a better pedagogical approach

456
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:03,216
to teach aiming

457
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:06,900
that our students will always

458
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,324
have a better understanding on

459
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:13,764
a practical way, but also with

460
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:16,910
a theoretical base. This.

461
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,940
That's it. Thank you very much

462
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,020
and I hope that you always

463
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,492
like this content, the content of this

464
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,750
talk. Thank you guys.
