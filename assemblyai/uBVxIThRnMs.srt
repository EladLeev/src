1
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,482
Welcome everybody to the importance of communication SIe.

2
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:38,434
We will cover today psychology safety in the context

3
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:41,800
of SIE. We have some case studies ready for you.

4
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,662
We plan to talk around 25 minutes, something like this.

5
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,734
And we will also show a little bit of tool we used in our case

6
00:00:49,772 --> 00:00:52,670
study. Be and yeah, let's start right away.

7
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,182
So my name is Flaunt Hubner, I'm tech strategy from

8
00:00:57,236 --> 00:01:00,190
Accenture and I'm working out of New York. Alex.

9
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,882
Thanks Lauren everybody, name is Alexander Schopper, also based in New York.

10
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:08,562
I'm a principal director with our talent and communication practice and

11
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:12,466
lead our psychological safety capability here at Accenture. Over to

12
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:15,402
you, Marco. Thanks, Alex.

13
00:01:15,566 --> 00:01:19,122
Hello everyone, my name is Marco Torre, I'm a senior manager

14
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:23,106
at Accenture, also a site reliability engineering

15
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:26,886
subject matter expert. So happy to talk to you about this

16
00:01:26,908 --> 00:01:30,234
topic. Perfect. So then let's start

17
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:33,418
right away. Yeah, sorry, Florian, I was just going

18
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:37,702
to kick it off and just say with respects to open communication

19
00:01:37,766 --> 00:01:40,700
and SRE, what do you mean by that?

20
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,574
Why is it so important? So,

21
00:01:44,612 --> 00:01:47,774
yeah, I mean, when we take one step back, what we

22
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:51,086
see that the situation in it, in corporate it and

23
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:53,866
so on for all of us is getting more and more complex.

24
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:57,262
It's getting more complex because of two run models.

25
00:01:57,406 --> 00:02:01,394
A lot of companies, a lot of our clients, they are still working one

26
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:05,122
side in waterfall model and one side with

27
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:08,346
agile teams, build run teams, really progressive,

28
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:11,446
doing agile, doing DevOps, doing SiE and so on. So you

29
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:15,126
have just two run models in parallel working most companies. And this is

30
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:18,858
leading to more and more complexity on the other side.

31
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:23,610
Shifting responsibilities, shifting responsibilities means here that

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,302
in the past everything was maybe on prem, you had some vendors,

33
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,838
some solutions outside of your company. But this

34
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:34,270
is changing now. Over time, you consume much more

35
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,094
the cloud, the cloud provider, getting more important. Now you have

36
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:41,870
relationships inside of your company. You must manage

37
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,842
so that the model there is changing and then also

38
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:49,266
into production, we have much more stress, so we need more

39
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:52,914
robustness in production because more and more changes sre coming

40
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:57,234
into production because of the change in the frequency with

41
00:02:57,272 --> 00:03:01,154
DevOps, with agile, we sre changing how we are working, we are changing

42
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:05,046
the way we are working, and this leads to more frequent changes in

43
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,378
production, smaller batch sizes and so on.

44
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:11,770
So this makes a lot of sense. Florian,

45
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,850
when I think about this though, and I think about open communication,

46
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,886
what I'm anchored on is the people aspect.

47
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:24,590
And what you're taking us through right now seems a lot like

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,774
process and technology. And I know there's a communication aspect to it,

49
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:31,022
but what about the lens on people. Yeah,

50
00:03:31,076 --> 00:03:34,594
valid point. I mean, in all of these areas, the people are

51
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:38,542
key. And what we see here normally is in this complex

52
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:42,162
situation, communication is really the most important thing because

53
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:45,646
you have this changing technologies. So changing

54
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:49,638
technologies is ongoing learning. This means we have to work better together,

55
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:53,318
we have to learn faster, and we are learning from each other.

56
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:56,966
Learning from each other means always communication, talking to

57
00:03:56,988 --> 00:04:00,140
each other, understanding what each person is doing.

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,134
Collaboration, key topic is always at the beginning,

59
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:06,860
we have the silos dev and quality,

60
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,940
security operations and so on, silent based working.

61
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,222
If we keep on going this, the collaboration is key,

62
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:18,170
but we have to bridge this wall, we have to tear down this walls,

63
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,402
and we have to work together and collaborate also. Their communication

64
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:24,654
is key. Incident reviews,

65
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:28,338
that's the blaming culture sometimes in some companies.

66
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:32,258
So what we want to see there more and more is this. Working together,

67
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:35,230
blameless post mortem culture,

68
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,094
speaking up, working together in a team, when you have an incident and

69
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:42,354
things like this. And then here, the last item.

70
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,390
Different perspective in a team, we have different perspectives.

71
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,914
Yeah. So this makes perfect sense to me.

72
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,386
Florian, with my site reliability engineering background and

73
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:56,954
working with a lot of project teams, it's interesting.

74
00:04:57,072 --> 00:05:01,114
All of these challenges that you're pointing out relates to

75
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:05,562
a topic that we've been focused on a lot around psychological

76
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:09,614
safety. Are you familiar with that term? A little bit,

77
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:12,494
but I think it would be good if you can describe it just for our

78
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:16,366
audience. Yeah, no, perfect. So on the next slide,

79
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:19,970
I mean, I'll give you verbatim, the definition, right. And this definition comes from

80
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,394
Amy Edmondson, who's one of the lead researchers in this.

81
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:27,254
But essentially, psychological safety is the belief that no

82
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,726
one believe that one thinks they will be punished or

83
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,362
humiliated for speaking up with ideas,

84
00:05:33,426 --> 00:05:36,950
questions, concerns or mistakes.

85
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,350
And when you put this in the context of site reliability engineering,

86
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,334
think about the soft skills that a site reliability

87
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:49,114
engineer needs, right. They're in a position where they have

88
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:52,954
got to bring up or voice concerns over the reliability

89
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:56,750
of systems. How resilient are our systems

90
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,106
problem solving? How is it that they're

91
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:05,458
applying this? Right. This might mean engaging with the business,

92
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:09,662
engaging with architectures, and bringing up some really uncomfortable

93
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:16,590
conversations. Right. So I'm in

94
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,642
no shape or form an expert in the theory

95
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:24,434
behind psychological safety, but if you move on to the next slide,

96
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:28,102
I'd like to talk about what are the differences that we see

97
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:31,998
across four dimensions. Right. When we start shifting our attentions

98
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:35,770
from the traditional approach on how is it that we approach

99
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,626
our confidence and our trust with our teams, but how

100
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:43,414
we shift that when we're thinking about this in the context of site reliability

101
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:47,242
engineering. So let's think about it from a blame perspective.

102
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:50,926
Mistakes that can be made, feedback that we're sharing back with

103
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:54,082
our teams, and then, of course, the elephant in the room.

104
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:57,906
Right. Management, our leadership. Right. So a

105
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:01,426
lot of times we're heads down, focused on the technical work that we have

106
00:07:01,448 --> 00:07:04,450
to accomplish. But like I said before,

107
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,294
the soft skills that an SRE need, it's very important that we

108
00:07:08,332 --> 00:07:12,146
have an environment where we feel safe

109
00:07:12,178 --> 00:07:15,974
that we can talk about these items, right. And so I'll quickly touch on some

110
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:19,514
key points within these four dimensions. But number

111
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:23,210
one, blame. Do you feel like you're in a team when

112
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,202
there's constant finger pointing going on?

113
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:30,274
So there's an issue in production, your first instinct

114
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:33,994
is, it's not my fault. My code passed

115
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:38,270
all tests in the lower environments. I'm sure that's networking.

116
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,006
I'm pretty sure that they missed the configuration. We're always telling the

117
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:46,434
infrastructure teams, you got to get on githubs, right? You got to version control your

118
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:49,422
changes. But even still, if there was a mistake,

119
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:53,378
right. How are we making our team members feel

120
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:57,238
when they actually do make a mistake? Right. Do we talk about it?

121
00:07:57,324 --> 00:08:01,046
Do we voice it over? Is it okay? Or are

122
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:04,486
we penalizing folks for that that goes on

123
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:08,326
that next dimension of feedback, are we sharing back that feedback?

124
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:12,154
Do we have the trust and confidence to accept feedback from our

125
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,610
team members? Right. And most importantly,

126
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,990
do we have the confidence and trust with our teams

127
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,302
if we're in a leadership position or if we're in a single

128
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:27,674
contributor position, do we trust in our colleagues,

129
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:31,774
our coworkers, or our team members to actually deliver what they have to and

130
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,002
why this is important in the context of site reliable engineering.

131
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:38,846
Well, think about it, right? We're not going to get into the concepts

132
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,354
of, say, for example, service level objectives and setting up your service level

133
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:46,174
indicators, but these are essentially tools and practices

134
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:49,266
that allow us to take risk in production environments.

135
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:52,786
Right. And do we feel that we have a culturally safe

136
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:56,390
environment to take risk? And that's what we wanted to focus

137
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,900
on as part of why psychological safety is so important.

138
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,966
And I want to point out one topic here also on this slide.

139
00:09:04,998 --> 00:09:08,454
What we sre in the traditional approach is that we have maybe the structure

140
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:11,898
like biz desk queue and port, and maybe security also in

141
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:15,230
the middle. That's easy to blame someone else because

142
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,734
this person is maybe not sitting in my team. We also can see

143
00:09:18,772 --> 00:09:22,426
when we break down the silos in an organization that when I'm

144
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:26,286
end to end responsible for something, there's not so much blame anymore.

145
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:30,334
So this also leads into a better culture, into a culture

146
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:34,420
like that people are responsible end to end for something and that

147
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,930
there's not so much finger pointing anymore. So the organization,

148
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,726
the form, how we structure teams is also leading a little bit in

149
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,038
the direction of how we treat people and how do we

150
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:49,580
talk about blame and do we point fingers or something like this?

151
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,930
Definitely makes sense. Florian.

152
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,374
So on this slide, I mean, when we started our journey, when we

153
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:05,134
started to talk about psychology, safety and trust, we also

154
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,654
thought, okay, is this a huge topic? Is this a topic which

155
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,560
can really improve our team?

156
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,562
We looked into the research, and what we found there is

157
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,094
that the numbers are clearly indicating that focusing

158
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:23,860
on psychology, safety, focusing on improving trust,

159
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,874
is a key topic for your team, is a key topic

160
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:31,634
to improve your innovation, for example, your productivity

161
00:10:31,762 --> 00:10:35,046
and your skill application. Marco, maybe you would

162
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,294
like to give us some more details to the slide and

163
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:41,242
explain a little bit how you see this.

164
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:45,254
Yeah. One thing I would like our audience

165
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:48,362
to anchor in on is that first metric that we call out, right?

166
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:52,080
So a 67% improvement in

167
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,270
a higher probability that employees will apply a new learned skill.

168
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,320
So essentially, in order for us to

169
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,962
introduce any sort of type of change, and that could be a technology change,

170
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:08,158
that could be a process change, just introducing the role

171
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:12,114
of an SRE or organization that's going to introduce new

172
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:15,398
silos, new trainings. But as most of

173
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:18,182
us know, working in organizations for many years,

174
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:21,560
organizations tend to, they don't like to change.

175
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,278
So definitely investing in communication is definitely going

176
00:11:26,284 --> 00:11:29,650
to pay off. As we see, having that ability

177
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,514
to quickly pivot an organization and the skill sets of a whole

178
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:37,642
team or a whole group or a whole technology group to start

179
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:41,118
enabling the culture of, yeah, sure, I'll pick up and learn a

180
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:44,458
new skill if that's where the organization

181
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:47,902
technically is headed. Right. So it's definitely something

182
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:51,326
that we want to call out and focus on.

183
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:55,042
And there are other metrics, benefits that we can see,

184
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,594
76% more engagement, eleven times

185
00:11:58,712 --> 00:12:02,370
more innovation, and 50%

186
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,702
more productivity. And so you might be asking,

187
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:09,560
well, how is it that we approach this? Right.

188
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,190
So the way we approach this is

189
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,694
essentially by focusing on, first, what are those

190
00:12:16,732 --> 00:12:20,054
challenges? And I touched a little bit on some of those. So number

191
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:23,314
one, culture is intangible, right.

192
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:26,390
It's very hard to change culture.

193
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,834
The way we approach this is with a data driven approach that

194
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:33,326
we'll give you guys an overview on. Also on

195
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:37,002
that same theme, of organizations are just resistance

196
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:41,230
to change. Right. It's very important that we get leadership buy in.

197
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,722
Right. They need to be fully on board as well.

198
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:48,386
And then just overall, you guys are starting to understand what does it

199
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:51,470
mean to be in a low psychologically safe environment.

200
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,398
Right. It starts with our practitioners.

201
00:12:54,494 --> 00:12:58,382
Right. They're the only way we're going to be able to spread

202
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:01,894
that bottoms up approach. And on the right hand side, I mean,

203
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,998
you'll see a couple of the activities that we run through.

204
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:09,834
We won't spend too much time on that because we'll run through those activities as

205
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,922
we do by looking at the insight scan tool

206
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:16,550
that we use to be able to measure the effectiveness

207
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,106
of culture change. So with that said,

208
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,914
we're going to hand it off to Alex, who is

209
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:27,486
going to give us the case study overview. And how is

210
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:31,326
that we actually applied this. Cool. Thank you, Marco. So that's exactly what

211
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,760
I'm to going do the next few minutes is to talk a little bit about

212
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,066
actually bringing this to life. So how did we experience this with a

213
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:42,354
representative team that represents, I think, some of the experiences that you've probably had

214
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:45,874
in the last few years and something we come across very often.

215
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:49,238
And then through that, I want to share, as Marco said, a tool that we

216
00:13:49,244 --> 00:13:52,566
use quite frequently, but also a framework to really understand

217
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,926
how do you make psychological safety actionable. It's kind of a big

218
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:58,806
term, and I think, as Marco Florence pointed out,

219
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:02,514
it means many different things to different people. So I want to share a framework

220
00:14:02,562 --> 00:14:05,594
of kind of how you can bring those to your teams and make it quite

221
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:09,194
actionable. So in this particular case, I want to talk about,

222
00:14:09,232 --> 00:14:12,346
we work with a product engineering team that need

223
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:16,266
to respond to really a dramatic increase

224
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:19,946
in growing sales and really get more client centric

225
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:23,054
during the pandemic? I think you might be able to relate to this.

226
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:26,350
We saw incredible productivity and efficiency gains.

227
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,586
Online sales went up as a result of that. And so that put a lot

228
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:32,814
of pressure on engineering and SRE teams.

229
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:36,278
And so the challenge really for this team was

230
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:40,886
how do we respond to the demand, the increased demand in business by

231
00:14:40,908 --> 00:14:45,026
introducing new features, keeping up with the number of site visitors

232
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:48,454
and traffic, all without compromising quality and

233
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:51,866
security. And the questions I want you to think about over the next

234
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:55,510
few minutes are how did this team overcome a culture of blame?

235
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,414
How was it able to learn from mistakes? How did we eventually

236
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:03,274
evolve the ways of working as we saw the increasing demand?

237
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,006
And ultimately, is this a model that you can scale across the

238
00:15:07,028 --> 00:15:10,762
organization and taking some of the agile best practices

239
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,570
and bringing those back into SRE.

240
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,826
So let's go to the next slide quickly because

241
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:21,394
I want to highlight here is essentially the approach we took,

242
00:15:21,512 --> 00:15:25,166
and you'll see that we have different key moments

243
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:29,286
in this journey that we did with the team. And it all started with

244
00:15:29,468 --> 00:15:32,674
the first point. Here you'll see called insight scan and debrief.

245
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:36,738
Another way to look at that is a retrospective or blameless post mortem.

246
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:41,082
So what we did over twelve weeks was run

247
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:44,970
three or four retrospectives or

248
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,726
postmortems over the course of three months that were all data driven

249
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:52,486
using the insight scan tool, and used online collaboration tools like Miro

250
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,014
and Mirror to facilitate anonymous conversations. I'll talk a little bit more about

251
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:59,306
that in a few minutes. And now you might be wondering,

252
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:03,054
like why? Seems kind of random. But what we did

253
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:07,054
too is look at what does it take for behaviors

254
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:10,754
and new ways of working for actually to

255
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:14,482
stick with the team. So the research coe points that teams and

256
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:18,518
leaders start to internalize new behaviors on their own

257
00:16:18,684 --> 00:16:22,134
once they've repeatedly done them over the course of three months.

258
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:26,134
So every two weeks, through smaller actions and

259
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:29,302
reinforcement. And so make a long story short,

260
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:33,658
we follow the cycle of running these workshops or using this tool

261
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,954
we're going to show, and then off of the back of that, really getting to

262
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:40,314
action very quickly to understand what is it that the leader needs to change,

263
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:44,426
what is it that the team members can change and addressing those with leadership trainings,

264
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:48,154
coachings and workshops. And if we go to the next slide,

265
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:51,646
you can see this is the framework that I mentioned earlier that

266
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:55,498
can help us sort of think about bringing psychological safety to teams.

267
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:59,458
And you might recognize some of these terms here around flow state.

268
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:03,714
But before we go there, I quickly wanted to highlight that the research is

269
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:07,134
clear in pointing out that it's not sufficient

270
00:17:07,182 --> 00:17:10,566
just to focus on psychological safety. And that's been our point

271
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:14,246
of view and what our work has shown. But to really understand what

272
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:18,322
it takes to be an effective team in an SRE context and what's expected

273
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:22,086
of the behaviors that Marco and Florian pointed out earlier,

274
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:25,898
you also need to look at intrinsic motivation, or as you can see here on

275
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:29,238
the x axis, team intrinsic motivation, these motivational drivers.

276
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:32,926
So that talks a lot about purpose and collaboration. And when we

277
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:36,030
see teams that have both high psychological safety and

278
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,122
high motivational drivers, they actually proactively assume

279
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:43,278
accountability. By comparison, teams that are in the

280
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:47,162
fear zone, they actually are more held accountable by leaders.

281
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:50,578
It's a big difference. So it's, do I actually feel comfortable? It's a step up?

282
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:54,174
Do I have a psychological safety? Am I motivated to own a mistake, to flag

283
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:57,746
a risk, to bring up a concern in a post mortem? It's very

284
00:17:57,768 --> 00:18:01,222
different than somebody asking a team member, what concerns did you see?

285
00:18:01,276 --> 00:18:04,486
Or please tell me who made that mistake? That's typically what we see

286
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:09,202
in the fear zone. But the flow zone is really characterized

287
00:18:09,266 --> 00:18:12,454
by teams that want to learn from their mistakes, and that's what we call positive

288
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:16,214
error orientation and have a lot higher levels of proactive

289
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,054
communication. You don't see those behaviors in both the apathy

290
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:23,306
and the fear zone. So that's actually what's holding

291
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,606
some of these teams back, is that lack of psychological safety. And,

292
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:30,394
Alex, I know you're touching a lot on the point of fear

293
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,986
and making mistakes, but we also touched on

294
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:37,506
the topic of being more innovative. Right. So you can

295
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:41,394
also think about, hey, it could be a team that they're pretty

296
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:44,942
good, not making that many mistakes,

297
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,922
but they're also not raising their hair and saying,

298
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:51,142
hey, we want to try new technologies or we want to test this out.

299
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:54,806
We want to take a risk. Right. That's also as.

300
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:58,142
The way I understand is those teams are in that flow zone,

301
00:18:58,226 --> 00:19:02,314
they're more prone to take risk. Right. That's definitely the

302
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:05,674
type of quality and culture that we need

303
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,822
if we want to definitely enable a SRE organization.

304
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:12,846
Right? That's correct. Yeah. It's a really good point. It's really around

305
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:17,006
calculated risks or acceptable risk, which is if we're trying to

306
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:20,638
solve for complex problems and we default to the

307
00:19:20,644 --> 00:19:24,238
ways of working and the inputs and the ways we're familiar with, we're not going

308
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:27,938
to be able to do that. So as requirements change,

309
00:19:28,104 --> 00:19:31,746
you want both the team proactively to share new ideas, but you also want the

310
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:35,154
leader in the silos state to be able to frame that correctly and say,

311
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,294
here's what we're trying to solve for. We don't know the answer yet,

312
00:19:38,332 --> 00:19:42,326
and here's the acceptable bandwidth of mistakes and errors we can make.

313
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:46,658
And here's where it's not acceptable. So a clear delineation of where mistakes

314
00:19:46,674 --> 00:19:50,774
are. Okay. And where not. And I like the term calculated

315
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:54,406
risk that you use because essentially, if you're familiar

316
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:57,174
with the concept or practice of service level objectives.

317
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,330
Right. We're taking calculated risk,

318
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,334
monitoring our systems in production. Right.

319
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:08,206
By being able to enable new features, and we're using the error budget to

320
00:20:08,228 --> 00:20:10,910
ensure that we're within those guardrails.

321
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,542
Yeah, sorry. This topic is exciting.

322
00:20:18,606 --> 00:20:21,794
Right. But, yeah, I mean, what I also wanted to call

323
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:25,346
out. What it sounds like, Alex, is that you essentially have

324
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:29,234
a quantitative approach to measure culture,

325
00:20:29,282 --> 00:20:33,254
which is something that is not really known for.

326
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:36,738
Right. They always say it's hard to measure culture, track culture. So that's

327
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:40,198
something actually you can show us. Yeah, that's a great point.

328
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:43,594
Let me jump into the tool that we use, because I think when you look

329
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:47,146
at comfort and apathy and fear, even that means a lot of different things to

330
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:50,954
different people. Right. And I think you've all, I mean, everybody listening probably

331
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:55,166
has been part of retros or post mortems, where you

332
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:58,218
talk about mistakes or you talk about vulnerability,

333
00:20:58,314 --> 00:21:01,806
or are you actually able to share what you did wrong? Even those things are

334
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:05,086
very subjective, or the leader says we need to become more

335
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:07,906
effective. Well, what does that even mean? So I think what we tried to do

336
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:09,780
is, and I'll share my screen here,

337
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,834
really take a data driven approach to blameless post

338
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:18,514
mortems and retrospectives. So what that

339
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:21,174
allows us to do, and I'll go through this in a second here, is really

340
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:24,738
to anchor a conversation on an objective baseline.

341
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:28,570
So we're coming into this, and this is a survey tool called the Insight scan.

342
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,506
It's 15 questions that generates real

343
00:21:32,528 --> 00:21:35,894
time data on team level psychological safety and motivation.

344
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:39,046
And we look at factors like courage or vulnerability,

345
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:43,038
accountability. So a lot of these things that are front and center to

346
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:46,334
a blameless SRE culture. And what we

347
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:50,666
want to do is for the team, during the retrospective

348
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:53,982
or the blameless, to actually measure this in real time.

349
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:57,874
And this is the case study of a team we work with. You can see

350
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:01,042
here, that was in the flow zone and was doing quite well.

351
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:05,122
So in this particular case, I can show you this dot right here.

352
00:22:05,256 --> 00:22:08,978
We started working with the team and exhibited both high psychological safety

353
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,790
and motivation. And then something interesting happened. You'll see here,

354
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,210
highlighted by this dot, that there was a security incident,

355
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:20,730
there was a data leak of private information. And ultimately

356
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,886
what happened, you can see here in that drop of psychological safety

357
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:29,286
that shows how the team responded. So what we observed

358
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:32,938
from that drop in psychological safety was personal breaking.

359
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:37,114
There was some undermining going on. There was finger pointing specifically

360
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:40,270
to two people who were supposedly responsible for the incident.

361
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,254
And that's how the conversation took

362
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:48,178
place. What we did was combined some

363
00:22:48,184 --> 00:22:51,762
of the best practices of a retrospective to really focus on what are

364
00:22:51,816 --> 00:22:55,134
the ways of working at this team with the best practices

365
00:22:55,262 --> 00:22:58,882
of a blameless post mortem. So we addressed questions

366
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:02,166
like, what were the failures that led to this in terms of

367
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:05,554
our ways of working, how much do we want to own this decision

368
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:09,046
as a team and what will remain on us in the future if we don't

369
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:12,182
solve this issue? So anchoring it to the future success

370
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:15,082
of the team and saying, what's the cost of not talking about the root cause

371
00:23:15,136 --> 00:23:18,474
here, not from who's to blame, but from what ways

372
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:21,680
of working and what processes got us here in the first place?

373
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,806
And then, really importantly, what can each individual do

374
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:29,166
better on that team to improve the situation? And what

375
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:31,998
you can see here, actually marked by the left,

376
00:23:32,164 --> 00:23:36,094
by these little dots where my cursor is. Courage was incredibly

377
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:39,198
low, vulnerability and inclusion and collaboration.

378
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:42,882
And so we talked about each of these dimensions, of what each

379
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:46,486
individual and what the leader can do on that

380
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,614
team to address some of those challenges. And so what that led was

381
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:54,694
a change in the ways of working, but from a progress side,

382
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:58,706
also improving feedback loops, being more thoughtful

383
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:02,646
and reflective, and actually visualizing some of the risks more clearly

384
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:06,634
when they created tickets. So we had some very tactical takeaways and

385
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:09,914
then some more of the soft skills. We talked about how

386
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:13,438
the leader needs to frame for uncertainty and actually lead a team

387
00:24:13,604 --> 00:24:17,454
like this. And so you can see here, the team, because of that,

388
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:21,630
was able to jump back into the flow zone and actually sustain that

389
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,486
for quite a while. But the key point here that is,

390
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:28,814
you can see by these micro movements and then even by this last drop,

391
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:32,226
which had to do with an external development, there was a change in strategy which

392
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:35,534
caused uncertainty, that psychological safety

393
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:39,198
is not something that stays once you've achieved it. It's not that once we

394
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:42,518
feel psychologically safe, it's always going to remain that way or remain that way for

395
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:46,534
a longer period of time, it can actually change with

396
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:50,054
the word of a leader, with an incident that was flagged or not.

397
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:53,734
And as you can see here, by this last drop

398
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:57,606
from when the team was in the flow zone back down to the apathy zone,

399
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,994
that reflected a change of strategy. There was nothing particularly wrong

400
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:05,438
that happened. There was no incident, there was no security breach. It was a

401
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:08,606
change of strategy and a shifting expectation of the team. That caused a lot

402
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:12,014
of uncertainty. And you can see the impact that this had on this

403
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:15,598
team, and this is really a proxy for team effectiveness. If a

404
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:19,086
team drops like that, that's going to have an impact on the velocity and output

405
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:22,974
of a team. And because we did a similar style retrospective

406
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:26,386
that I just outlined, the team was able to bounce back pretty

407
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:30,134
quickly, redefine its ways of working, had to change its north star and

408
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:33,782
jump back into the flow zone. So we do this whole process over

409
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:36,966
three to four months with this team. Ok, Alex, I think this

410
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:40,090
is really. Yeah, four months.

411
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,650
And then what happens when you're not there anymore?

412
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:47,418
How is the team behaving and acting when

413
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,118
this is the over? The psychology scan was done.

414
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:54,206
Yeah, that's a good point. I think first part is what

415
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:57,840
we saw is teams start to have this vocabulary around

416
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,086
vulnerability inclusion. So they start using these terms to

417
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:06,578
actually make their conversations a little bit more specific. And then

418
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:09,826
I'm going to show you in a second an example of kind

419
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:11,890
of a best practice retrospective,

420
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,114
really. And I think that's the key piece, is that teams need

421
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:19,334
to do this over a recurring period of time. And I think what we saw

422
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:22,886
with this particular team is not just a post mortem when the

423
00:26:22,908 --> 00:26:26,886
incident occurs, but actually continual retrospective. So the

424
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:30,582
team builds the muscle memory of being able to have these conversations.

425
00:26:30,726 --> 00:26:35,126
That's a really excellent question because a lot of teams don't feel comfortable

426
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:38,010
having these types of conversation or being vulnerable.

427
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:41,066
And then when we do ask them to do that, we do kind of on

428
00:26:41,088 --> 00:26:44,326
an ad hoc basis with post mortems.

429
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:47,534
But it actually, it's a muscle memory that a team needs to build up over

430
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:51,230
time. So after a while you are really changing the behavior, you really

431
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,442
change the language of the team and you change how they act.

432
00:26:54,516 --> 00:26:58,066
So they are bouncing back much faster into psychology shape on

433
00:26:58,088 --> 00:27:02,046
the flow area when you stop doing the scans.

434
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:06,274
Yeah, exactly. The ability to sort of get to the root cause of

435
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,900
what's going on is a lot higher.

436
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,586
So I talked a little bit about these retrospectives and blame this post mortem.

437
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:16,738
So here's an example of and some best practices of how we actually brought

438
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:20,666
the best of both worlds together. And I hope that

439
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:23,606
you can think about this too in your respective teams,

440
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:27,420
in your organizations, as some guiding points

441
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,278
that you can bring back for retrospectives and postmortems.

442
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:35,438
So the first one is using real time data, I think, you know, through the

443
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:38,526
tool. Hopefully it became clear that it's not so much a

444
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:42,814
conversation of did Florian or did Marco say something,

445
00:27:42,932 --> 00:27:46,894
but what is our team level perception? It's not about individual perceptions

446
00:27:46,942 --> 00:27:49,954
necessarily, but it is really how do we function as a team?

447
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:53,858
And that that data has to be anonymous. That's very important, but it

448
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:57,154
needs to be data driven conversation because it takes away

449
00:27:57,352 --> 00:28:00,562
that initial personal element and anchors it on an objective

450
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:03,974
of truth. The other piece here is that you

451
00:28:04,012 --> 00:28:07,158
want in the beginning, as I said, it's really hard for teams to open up

452
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:10,678
and actually develop psychological safety sometimes even

453
00:28:10,844 --> 00:28:13,946
incredibly hard or difficult if that low psychological safety is coming

454
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:17,302
from the leader themselves. And so you want a neutral

455
00:28:17,366 --> 00:28:21,886
third party to be able to facilitate the retros or post mortems and

456
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,578
give everybody a fair chance to speak without criticism

457
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:29,520
and without the leader jumping in to defend certain points.

458
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,134
And the second piece you see here

459
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:36,866
around these sticky notes, and this is, I think one of the great benefits of

460
00:28:36,968 --> 00:28:40,386
working remotely or virtually through a mural or mirror is you can

461
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:44,350
actually give people the ability to comment and share their perspectives

462
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,922
anonymously and confidentially. So often

463
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,378
retrospectives are held where we expect people to come off mute and share their perspective.

464
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:55,654
That's a big jump if you don't feel psychologically safe. So a

465
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,426
way to get there is enable anonymous mode

466
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:03,066
and then pinpoint and have conversations around specific data points of

467
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:06,426
maybe, why is courage low? Why aren't we collaborating? It's not so

468
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:09,846
much about who said what in this context. It's about understanding.

469
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:12,718
Do we have a common perception? And what are some of these pain points that

470
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:16,560
we're seeing across the team? We go to the next slide quickly.

471
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,286
I can make this very short because you can see here that I think the

472
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:26,198
best practice is you don't just come out of this with a root cause analysis,

473
00:29:26,234 --> 00:29:29,454
but you really want to leave with specific improvement

474
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:33,010
ideas, not just as a team. That's what you see here with number three,

475
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,802
but then number four, who's going to own this? And I think that's often

476
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:40,358
the big gap in post mortems, is you agree, you understand you

477
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,602
have a way forward, but there's not a clear set of expectations

478
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,886
and accountability structure around, well, who's actually going to do this? And I think the

479
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:49,986
critical piece is it's not just leaders or the scrum

480
00:29:50,018 --> 00:29:53,482
master or other people who need to own this going forward. It's very much around

481
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,290
what can every single individual do to contribute to this?

482
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,586
And I think the key piece is small sres micro learning. So that could be

483
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:04,762
a specific activity to say, I will raise one concern

484
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:08,426
in the next post mortem, because maybe previously you haven't spoken

485
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,246
up at all, but just really raising one concern and starting there and seeing what

486
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:14,546
the feedback is, and maybe the next time you feel more comfortable to raise two

487
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:18,242
or three things that you've seen, but starting small and giving

488
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:21,380
everybody the chance to weigh in is a critical piece here.

489
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,296
And so what we see, you kind of like,

490
00:30:28,318 --> 00:30:32,028
okay, why does this approach matter? And I think we talked about some of the

491
00:30:32,034 --> 00:30:36,120
immediate benefits as it relates to incident

492
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,436
review. But if you take a step back and you sort of look at

493
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:43,440
why do teams benefit from this long term approach of working

494
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:47,184
over twelve weeks and internalizing new behaviors? This is

495
00:30:47,302 --> 00:30:50,720
the data we saw across all the projects that we've worked on.

496
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,244
So when teams internalize these best practices, take a data

497
00:30:54,282 --> 00:30:58,576
driven approach. Reflect not just in post mortems, but regularly

498
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,748
in retrospectives to build that ability. And the leader takes an

499
00:31:01,754 --> 00:31:05,712
active participation and not the role of the justifier.

500
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:09,408
You see that psychological safety increases by an

501
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,888
average 30%. Motivation goes up by 57%.

502
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:16,372
About two out of three teams were able to move into the flow zone.

503
00:31:16,516 --> 00:31:20,820
And just to double click on that, if you look at what specific behaviors improved

504
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,696
as teams moved into the flow zone, it's the ones on the right. So purpose,

505
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:28,044
relatedness, accountability and courage. And then coming

506
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:32,044
back to our early point, if we want to really have true learning culture

507
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:35,872
where we take the best practices of incidents and learning

508
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:39,200
from mistakes or sharing new ideas,

509
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,396
you need the behaviors of courage and accountability specifically, and you can

510
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:47,168
see some of the improvements that have been made here. So there are real tangible

511
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:51,040
team benefits, real benefits to team performance

512
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,608
through this approach. Exactly. So appreciate

513
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:58,376
all the insight, Alex. And anchoring this back to just

514
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,730
the theme around site reliability engineering, I get a lot of questions from

515
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,210
the project teams that I work with,

516
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,416
reliability leaders, and they ask, how is it that we can

517
00:32:09,438 --> 00:32:13,196
enable SRe across our organization? Because it's not so much just the

518
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:17,036
role, but it's the practice, right. We want to enable some of these qualities and

519
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:20,188
characteristics, and even if we're hiring externally, right,

520
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:23,360
SRE, the role is so niche that it's hard to fill.

521
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,896
So when we start thinking about how can we enable some of the folks that

522
00:32:26,918 --> 00:32:30,944
we have already, it's not intuitive to

523
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:34,384
think, right? We're always thinking technical, we're always thinking skills. But how

524
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:37,412
about some of those culture changes that we can change, right.

525
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:41,284
And like I said before, this will enable us

526
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:45,408
to have those conversations with our product owners, with our business counterparts about,

527
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:50,024
hey, we want to define some service level objectives within some of our critical business

528
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:53,576
applications or on that theme of

529
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:57,288
post mortems, right. Being able to be more open

530
00:32:57,454 --> 00:33:00,964
will allow us to maybe find some of these systemic

531
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,156
issues that are around that perhaps somebody is

532
00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:07,228
just too scared to bring up because they're like, well, I know that's going to

533
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:11,116
open up a can of worms and I

534
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:14,636
don't want to get involved in that project, right. But that's

535
00:33:14,668 --> 00:33:18,576
essentially the difference between someone or

536
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:22,252
a team who's in the apathy or fear zone versus being in the flow zone.

537
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:26,096
Right. And I'm sure there's also some organizational

538
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:29,604
impacts that probably Florian, you probably know about. Would love

539
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:33,136
to touch on. Yeah, for sure. So one key topic

540
00:33:33,168 --> 00:33:36,628
I want to touch on is really this, we talked now about the

541
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:40,836
team level, but also this is enabling full enterprise transformation.

542
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:44,248
We sre that many organization or many teams we

543
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:47,290
are talking to, they are a little bit in this. Yes, but situation.

544
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,216
Yes, we understand we have to change. Yes, we understand we have to pick up

545
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,852
a new skill, for example, but we don't have time for that.

546
00:33:55,906 --> 00:33:58,540
But we don't have the tool for that and so on and so on.

547
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,148
So a lot of teams, they're finding all the time excuses why they cannot

548
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:05,536
do something. And this can be many times because of they

549
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:09,250
don't keep psychology safe enough to go into a risk situation.

550
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,610
So the learning here is also for us,

551
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,056
a transformation is slow or transformation may stop totally

552
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:20,484
when people don't feel safe. Psychology safe because they

553
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:24,164
just want to keep on going. Whatever they are doing, they're not changing their

554
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:28,116
behavior. So this is important for an enterprise, this is important for a

555
00:34:28,138 --> 00:34:31,464
full communication. If you would like to change, if you would like to

556
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,648
transform, and we all have to change and transform all the time.

557
00:34:34,814 --> 00:34:38,540
So psychology safe is a key term here,

558
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,950
especially in SiE because SRE is something new.

559
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,472
It's a new term, it's a new behavior, it's a new skill

560
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:50,270
and topic for most of the companies.

561
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,620
Okay. I hope we could explain

562
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,756
a little bit of psychology safety, why that's so

563
00:34:57,778 --> 00:35:01,950
important and so on. If you have more questions, feel free
