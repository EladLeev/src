00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,634
Hi, I am Tanya ka. Welcome to

2
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:16,570
my talk at Conf 42. Instant response

3
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,974
for developers and DevOps folks,

4
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:23,546
too. Actually, this is instant response for

5
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:27,642
literally everyone. So I do all sorts of work now.

6
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:30,986
I used to do appsec full time, and I would respond to

7
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:34,266
a lot of security incidents. And I don't know how to say

8
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:38,114
this nicely, but sometimes people would try to help, and then they would break

9
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:42,206
things and mess things up and ruin evidence and make my life really way harder

10
00:02:42,238 --> 00:02:46,766
than it needs to be as a security incident, either manager or investigator.

11
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,034
And I was just like, oh, my gosh, why would they do this? So one

12
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:53,190
day I gave training to the whole

13
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,662
it department with my colleagues. Just to be clear, I didn't do this single

14
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:59,942
handedly. So we taught help desk, we taught the system

15
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:03,958
administrators, we taught the software developers. We're like, this is what an incident looks like,

16
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:06,826
and this is when we need you to call us. And here's why we need

17
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:10,940
you to call us. And my life got infinitely better.

18
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,790
We spent less money on responding to incidents. We responded smoother.

19
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,814
Our reputation didn't get as damaged. We were

20
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:24,426
able to stop some problems from happening, and we ended

21
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,354
up having better relations with other teams. And so since then, whenever I train

22
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:32,482
software developers, because that's what I do, I chain people in

23
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:34,980
secure coding and appsec, stuff like that,

24
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,900
and I run community events. But anyway,

25
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,462
whenever I train a team, I show them

26
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:47,094
that. And basically, security incidents go better

27
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:50,278
from then on. And security incidents are the most

28
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:54,534
expensive way to deal with a vulnerability. It's the most humiliating

29
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:58,262
way, time consuming way, scary and humiliating

30
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:02,250
way. And so I want all of us to have fewer security

31
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,914
incidents and the ones we have, I want to go better. And so

32
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:09,390
that's why I have this training I do, or whatever.

33
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,166
This is me condensing it down as fast as I can to help. You look

34
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:16,682
like a superstar at work when there is an emergency.

35
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:20,386
Okay, so who am I? I'm Tanya Jenka. I started this

36
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:24,062
little company called we hack Purple, which was acquired by Semgrap

37
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:27,838
this summer. And now I'm head of education and community, and I just do lots

38
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:30,610
of training and free, fun community events, which is basically,

39
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,560
like, stuff that I really like doing.

40
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,038
So I'm known as she hacks purple. And yes, I have some purple hiding in

41
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:41,558
my hair. I wrote a book called Alison Bob Learn Application

42
00:04:41,644 --> 00:04:45,146
Security, and I'm way behind on my next book, don't tell

43
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,330
my publisher.

44
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,506
So this is year 28 for me of working in tech. I'm an advisor at

45
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:55,818
some startups I love OASP. I blog and

46
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:59,342
stream and do stuff like on the Internet all the time to share information.

47
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:03,738
But the key takeaway is that I'm a nerd at large on the Internet

48
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:07,646
and I really care about the security of software. Those are

49
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:11,490
the key takeaways and I create a lot of content. So enough about me,

50
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,422
let's talk about incidents. So what even is incident response?

51
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:19,198
What even is it? It's an organized

52
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:22,458
approach of addressing and managing the aftermath

53
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:25,814
of a security breach or an IT incident that

54
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:28,978
has to do with something to do with security. So the goal is to handle

55
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:32,294
the situation in a way that limits the damage and

56
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,058
reduces the recovery time and costs. So I want

57
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:39,862
to save money, I want to save time, I want to save reputation,

58
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,302
I want to save employees from having lots of new gray hair.

59
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,006
I'm so not kidding. Okay, so what's an

60
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:50,574
event versus an incident? So there's actually lots of events all

61
00:05:50,612 --> 00:05:53,594
the time, but it's not necessarily a security incident.

62
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:56,926
So on the right I like to think of that as an event, and on

63
00:05:56,948 --> 00:06:00,802
the left I like to think of that as an incident. Like she's for sure

64
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:04,354
something bad has happened. Okay, so in simple terms,

65
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:08,370
a security event is when something strange happened

66
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,246
or is happening and you're suspecting something's wrong, but you're not quite sure

67
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:15,638
and you need to do triage at this point. But a security

68
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:19,542
incident is when you are certain that something bad has

69
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:23,718
or is happening. So for example, if you find your data

70
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:27,466
for sale on the dark web and you have this giant magazine write you and

71
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:30,746
say, hey, Tanya, will you give me a quote about how you feel that your

72
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:33,260
data is for sale for only $50?

73
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,400
That is a security incident for sure.

74
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,990
Okay, so this is my first talk ever with a trigger warning.

75
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,106
I'm going to tell one story, so I'm going to have many, many stories throughout

76
00:06:48,138 --> 00:06:51,954
this to help illustrate my point. But one story is something where something bad

77
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:55,618
happens to children. It's not graphic. I don't get into detail, but if you're a

78
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:59,646
really sensitive person, you might want to step out. Security incidents

79
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:03,394
can be scary. And I tell the story to explain the gravity

80
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:07,254
of a situation. And again, no details, but I would

81
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:11,178
rather, you know and leave rather than stay, not be aware and

82
00:07:11,184 --> 00:07:14,140
be upset later. So judge for yourself.

83
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,134
Okay, so your needs, its software

84
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:21,574
to be secure. It needs all your applications, your APIs,

85
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:25,066
your SaaS products, your crops products. Like any piece of software, it needs

86
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:28,894
to be secure. It does. Developers are our first line

87
00:07:28,932 --> 00:07:32,302
of defense in that matter. They just are. All of it

88
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:35,434
helps it. Security works really hard on it. But developers,

89
00:07:35,562 --> 00:07:38,626
we're counting on you. And so without your buy in,

90
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:42,180
us security folks are lost. And so if something happens,

91
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,514
sometimes we need your help and we are not

92
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:49,762
trying to make you do our jobs. It's stuff that we can't do

93
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,622
without your assistance. And so there are five things that we need

94
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:56,920
from you, and most of them are things we just need you to know.

95
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,478
So we're going to talk about your role during a security incident. We're going

96
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:04,426
to talk about need to know and a couple of stories. And the purpose of

97
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:08,042
this is so that you know what to do and why.

98
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:11,100
So you're not just blindly doing stuff. You understand the value.

99
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,522
So the first thing is, if the security,

100
00:08:14,656 --> 00:08:17,520
so tell the security team, if you see something,

101
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,966
it's better to report something and have it be nothing chain have

102
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:25,182
it the other way around and not report it. I remember someone calling

103
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:29,166
me once and he was like, oh my gosh. All the super sensitive

104
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:33,058
USB drives, because this was back in the day just

105
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:36,580
are missing from my desk. Oh, my gosh, there's the sensitive information.

106
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,986
I had it, my drawer locked. I had my office door locked. I don't know

107
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:43,366
how this happened. And he was just freaking out. And I

108
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:46,822
was like, okay, one, go outside your office,

109
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:50,934
ask if anyone saw something. And he's like, okay. And he goes out

110
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:54,554
and then his administrative assistant was there and she's like, oh,

111
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:57,660
hi. The courier came up,

112
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,346
the super secure courier came and he picked up the

113
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:05,350
drives. I let him in. I hope you don't mind because you were at lunch.

114
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,478
And so he had come back and she'd been in the bathroom, she'd missed him,

115
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:11,806
and he'd been freaking out in his office. And then he said, oh,

116
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:15,294
my gosh, you must think I'm an idiot. I'm like, no, you followed the policy

117
00:09:15,412 --> 00:09:18,686
literally. Exactly. You're a hero if this

118
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:22,338
is not what had happened. And you'd run around fooling around for an hour or

119
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,794
two. That's an hour or two where the criminals gang away with our

120
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:29,102
stuff, right? So you followed the policy perfectly.

121
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:32,406
She should have left you a note and told you. She assumed she would

122
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,826
have seen you, right? Like our fingers got cropped,

123
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:38,806
but you took like, what, two minutes of my time?

124
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:42,166
You're great. Thank you for following the policy. And he's like, oh, I'm like,

125
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:46,010
I'd rather a false positive anytime over a false negative.

126
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,186
Some things that you might see would be like, what if your APIs keep

127
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,626
going down. They keep crashing all the time. Or there's a certain API that just

128
00:09:53,648 --> 00:09:57,146
keeps crashing and you don't know why. The monitoring is like, oh, it's so

129
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:00,538
heavy. There's so much latency. It's so slow, and you look and you can't

130
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:04,106
figure it out. Call the security team. There's probably a bot

131
00:10:04,218 --> 00:10:08,026
or some sort of brute force attack happening or something. Let us

132
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:12,158
help. If there's something that you're

133
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:15,886
like, that's just so weird, why is this happening? Call us. We don't

134
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:19,266
always know the answer, but we can tell you if it's a security thing or

135
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:22,478
not. Usually pretty fast, and sometimes it's that our tools

136
00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:25,654
aren't configured quite the right way or maybe forgot to. Tell us about

137
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,526
this new API you launched recently. There's lots of reasons we might not have

138
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:33,322
seen it, but if you're like, I just can't figure this out, call us.

139
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:37,500
We want to help. Okay, so that's, one, if you see something,

140
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,754
please say something. Two, if we

141
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:46,846
call you into a security incident, please don't leave for

142
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:51,694
the day without telling us. So I

143
00:10:51,732 --> 00:10:55,626
was responding to a security incident this dev had cross site scripting

144
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:59,074
in his app. He had all sorts of other problems, too, and someone was

145
00:10:59,112 --> 00:11:02,878
actively attacking it, like, actively exploiting

146
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:06,818
his app on the spot. And I was like,

147
00:11:06,984 --> 00:11:09,406
okay, we got to do this. We got to do that. We need to release

148
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:12,340
an update. And he's like, okay.

149
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,926
I said, listen, I'll be back in a few minutes. I just have to go

150
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:19,286
brief my boss. We finally figured out what's going on and which app

151
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:22,626
it is and who to talk to, and he's like, okay. And then my boss

152
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:25,766
and my boss's boss and my boss's boss felt the need to panic a little

153
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:28,906
bit, because that's what happens sometimes, and it's my job to cool them down.

154
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:32,586
Like, calm down, calm down. It's going to be okay. So I ended up taking

155
00:11:32,688 --> 00:11:35,980
longer. I thought it would be 1015 minutes. It was like 45 minutes.

156
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,998
I come back and he's gone. And I say

157
00:11:40,084 --> 00:11:43,598
to the cubicle mate, hey, where'd he go? And they're like, oh, he had to

158
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:46,254
go catch his bus for the day, so he left. He's like,

159
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,810
what? Do you have his number? No.

160
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,646
Do we have, like, a pager? Because chain, I'm old, and pagers

161
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:56,498
were a thing. And they're like,

162
00:11:56,584 --> 00:12:00,210
no. And we don't have him on call, and we don't have the right,

163
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,586
according to the union, to phone him unless he's on call.

164
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:06,502
And also, we just don't have his number because we never put him on call.

165
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:10,166
So what do you need? I'm like, I need to release a bug fix on

166
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,254
this app, like, right now. Can you push this code? And he's like, no.

167
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:16,986
I'm like, I can fix the code. Can someone push it? And no one was

168
00:12:17,008 --> 00:12:20,282
there that had the access and permissions to push the code,

169
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:23,898
and it just got hacked all night. And I'm sitting there

170
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:27,406
powerless. And I didn't have a waf in front of

171
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:30,746
it. I didn't have a content delivery network. I couldn't deploy virtual.

172
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:34,526
I couldn't even turn it off. We just had to sit there.

173
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,120
Eventually, I went home and I was just like,

174
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,190
so please don't leave. If you have been brought into an incident,

175
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,298
unless you tell them, so say, like, hey, I'm leaving. Here's my number if you

176
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:48,578
need me, because I could have fixed that bug. I did.

177
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:51,506
And the next morning, I left all these instructions for him. I'm like, oh,

178
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:55,806
he's things immediately. And apparently

179
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:59,326
the attacker stopped partway through the night because they were tired of just owning

180
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:02,826
us. And anyway, and so he

181
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,900
fixed that. We did tests. It was fine. And I was like,

182
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,762
please don't leave without telling us. I can't do this without

183
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:14,026
you, literally. Okay, so that's number two. Number three,

184
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:18,138
this is an emergency. I have had devs

185
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:21,822
just like, go to a regular team

186
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:24,958
meeting, go out and have lunch, do all these things. I'm like,

187
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:28,238
this is literally an emergency. That's why I called you in. If you're going

188
00:13:28,244 --> 00:13:30,894
to leave your desk and go do other things, or like, they're like, oh,

189
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:33,666
I have this deadline on Friday, so I was thinking I'd work on your thing

190
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,946
tomorrow. I'm like, I don't care about any of your deadlines. This takes top

191
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:40,494
priority. Do you need an email from the CEO

192
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:43,638
to tell you, like, stop doing that other crap? Nothing else is important

193
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:47,318
except this right now. And if your boss questions

194
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:50,646
it, send your boss to the IT security team and they

195
00:13:50,668 --> 00:13:53,914
will explain the level of importance. We don't crank you in

196
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:57,414
unless it's really important. We do every possible thing we can ourselves

197
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:00,634
without your help because that's our

198
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:04,362
job. But if we call you in, it's because we absolutely can't do it without

199
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,774
you. And so all your other work stops. It's only

200
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:11,166
the security incident. We will talk to your boss, no problem. Just like, oh,

201
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:14,734
my gosh, please treat

202
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:18,980
it like the emergency that it is. So that's number three. Number four,

203
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,654
follow. Need to know. So unless

204
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:26,594
someone else needs to know a specific thing about

205
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,294
the security incident, don't tell them.

206
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:33,046
And that includes your boss. I have many times

207
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:36,338
run interference on behalf of my investigators

208
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:39,362
where the boss is blocking the cubicle,

209
00:14:39,426 --> 00:14:42,870
and they're like, you can't take my employee's computer because

210
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,306
I trust him and I know him, and I promise

211
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:50,106
he's dead. So you can just leave now. Get out of my way.

212
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:54,266
I don't have time for your crap. You think you're being loyal to

213
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:57,574
your employee or whatever, but we all work for the same organization,

214
00:14:57,702 --> 00:15:01,066
and if we spot some, like, we have the right to look at someone's

215
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:04,362
computer. We only do it if there's a pretty darn

216
00:15:04,426 --> 00:15:07,962
good reason, and that doesn't mean your employee is bad.

217
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:11,650
It could be that someone broke into your employee's computer. And I actually find that

218
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,570
to be way more often the case or there's a misunderstanding,

219
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,634
but your boss does not need to know. And so

220
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:22,654
lots of times they'll say, hey, I need to brief you on the security incident.

221
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:26,038
And I bring them into a room, and then I run little circles around them

222
00:15:26,044 --> 00:15:29,766
and give them no details and waste time while my team goes and removes the

223
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:33,382
computer or asks the person for an interview or

224
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:36,586
calls the police or whatever it is they need to do. I'm like, I'll go

225
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:40,074
distract the boss, no problem. Your boss does

226
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:43,306
not have the right to know. They get

227
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:47,070
to know you're working on a security incident. They totally can go ask the security

228
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,862
team for more details. But if they're like, hey, show me the code you're working

229
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,400
on. No. Oh, what's happening? No.

230
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,760
Okay, so first story.

231
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,022
So I was late for work one day because I had a dentist appointment.

232
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:06,894
I really like having nice teeth. I want to still have teeth

233
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:10,402
when I'm old. So I go to the dentist, and everyone

234
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:13,894
knew I was at the dentist. I show up at 1030 instead of at nine,

235
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:17,494
and I walk towards my team, and they're like, meeting room,

236
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:21,206
meeting room. Go. The big meeting room. Now there's a security incident. I'm like,

237
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:24,390
but all of you are here. Who's managing the security

238
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,994
incident? They're like a help desk guy. I'm like, help desk isn't on our

239
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:31,226
team. They're like, go. They told us we're not allowed in.

240
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,500
Like, what? So I go in.

241
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,542
So this organization had two buildings. There is one main

242
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:41,854
headquarters building where all of us were, and then there was a side, like,

243
00:16:41,892 --> 00:16:45,566
smaller building across town where maybe, like, 10% of our

244
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,660
people worked. And basically,

245
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,054
they were having Internet troubles. They couldn't get anything to load.

246
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:56,798
Everything was not working. And so people had called help desk,

247
00:16:56,894 --> 00:17:00,774
and the help desk person decided he would be a hero today and that

248
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,022
he would handle it himself. And so he started

249
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:07,334
calling all the executives and telling them that our

250
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:10,866
building that was made of concrete, it was not an Internet

251
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:14,518
connected, smart building. It was a regular concrete building, was infected

252
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,494
with malware, and that the whole building had malware,

253
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:20,714
and it was not safe. I walk into this room,

254
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:24,486
and all the sea level executives are losing their tops. They're totally

255
00:17:24,518 --> 00:17:27,146
freaking out. They're like, oh, my gosh, Bob. And they're like, where were you,

256
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:31,166
Tanya? I'm like, at the dentist, just like my out of office said. And my

257
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:34,814
team told you, and we needed you, and you weren't like, I had my phone.

258
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:38,574
You could have called. Actually, you literally have my number

259
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:42,740
inside each one of your passes, and I laminated it,

260
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,686
so you had my number, and they're like, well, we needed you, and you weren't

261
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:49,266
there. I'm like, so you didn't call me, and you're upset that you didn't call

262
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:52,718
me, okay. And I'm like, so what's going on? And they're like,

263
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:55,526
well, this building has malware. I'm like, that building is made of concrete. It does

264
00:17:55,548 --> 00:17:58,934
not have malware. And they're like, oh, you don't know.

265
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:03,114
I hope he knows. And he's the boss. Okay, so here's what

266
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:06,746
happened, everyone. So Canadians love the

267
00:18:06,768 --> 00:18:09,914
Winter Olympics. We love it, and we the

268
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:13,034
most love hockey and ice skating. And guess what was on that day?

269
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:16,938
Ice skating. And so in the canadian government,

270
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:20,254
there's generally this don't ask, don't tell rule when it comes

271
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:23,566
to watching the Olympics at work. And so what they do

272
00:18:23,588 --> 00:18:26,878
is they'll have one boardroom in each building, and they're like, the Olympics are going

273
00:18:26,884 --> 00:18:30,114
to be showing there. We know it's the Winter Olympics, and if

274
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:33,618
you watch it from your desk, you're in trouble. But if you want

275
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:36,994
to go see how whoever does at whatever go

276
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,626
to this boardroom and they just stream it for that week or whatever, and we

277
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:44,086
just give up the productivity hit, because otherwise people stream it at their

278
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:47,414
desk, and it's always, you're not allowed streaming at your desk, because if

279
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:51,938
every single person's streaming at their desk, there's no Internet.

280
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,718
Right? So apparently, the head of this building decided

281
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,842
to go against government policy and say, if you want time

282
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:02,618
off to watch the Olympics? You're taking vacation days. I don't care.

283
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:06,078
I am strict. I am a Grinch. You're not doing it.

284
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:09,386
So every single one of them, like literally 80,

285
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:13,610
90% of employees were all streaming the figure skating.

286
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,994
So there was no malware. However, guess what happened? All those executives.

287
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:21,586
So what I do, as soon as I start an incident, I'm like, I am

288
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:24,466
the incident manager. Here is what we're going to do. You are not going to

289
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:28,318
tell people outside this room anything except that the security team has tapped

290
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,378
you for an incident. That's all they get. They want more info, they come to

291
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:34,146
me. It's called need to know. And I'm like, bark, bark, bark, bark,

292
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:36,950
bark. Hope that guy didn't do that.

293
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,326
So they all told their admins, their admins told all their friends.

294
00:19:40,508 --> 00:19:44,074
For months I would get in the elevator. And I remember the time where that

295
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:47,770
building had malware. It was so scary. I wonder how many people were hurt.

296
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,802
And so one, don't run around and

297
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:59,614
tell everyone. Number four, don't run around and tell everyone.

298
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:03,354
It is no one else's business, including your boss. I'm not kidding.

299
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,706
And I know that this is a ridiculous story. It wasted thousands

300
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:11,202
upon thousands upon thousands of dollars in people

301
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:14,834
fretting and worrying. People in that building want to evacuate because of this help

302
00:20:14,872 --> 00:20:18,798
desk guy who didn't know what he was talking about. And he kept

303
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:22,418
calling the executives and taking calls when I instructed them to talk to

304
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:25,318
me, it took me three days to get full control of the incident and to

305
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,326
get all the executives to listen to me again because they felt that I was

306
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:31,526
being a bit of a sourpuss about it. And I was like, this is what

307
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:35,030
has happened. This is what Wireshark says. This is what our network,

308
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,378
this is what says. And they're just like, we don't believe you. We believe the

309
00:20:38,384 --> 00:20:41,354
help desk guy. I'm like, okay, so,

310
00:20:41,392 --> 00:20:44,458
number five, do not try to manage a

311
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:48,090
security incident yourself and be a hero.

312
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,902
And so the last one also illustrated this,

313
00:20:51,956 --> 00:20:55,214
but it was more about need to know and telling a whole bunch of people

314
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:58,930
that shouldn't know and then literally terrifying 1000

315
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,620
people.

316
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,066
So this is where the trigger warning comes in. If that is a thing you

317
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:09,554
want to step out for, step out now. So not

318
00:21:09,592 --> 00:21:13,574
at my office, but the incident manager who first trained me,

319
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,494
his previous office, one of the help desk guys, had decided he

320
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:21,294
would manage an incident and he stumbled across images

321
00:21:21,362 --> 00:21:25,450
of child abuse and he accidentally

322
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,394
viewed a bunch of things that he could not unsee and

323
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:34,490
in doing so, then went and deleted a bunch of things because obviously

324
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,254
it's offensive, right? And then freaked out

325
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:41,758
and then did a bunch of things and ended up calling the security team.

326
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:45,290
Well, what he did was he ruined the chain of custody,

327
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,438
which meant none of it counted as evidence in a legal

328
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:53,042
way anymore. And the person who

329
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:56,734
had been doing this very extraordinarily terrible

330
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,480
thing got to go free.

331
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,440
And that employee ended up in therapy for

332
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,326
the person I worked with. He's like, after four years, he was still in

333
00:22:08,348 --> 00:22:11,766
regular therapy over what he saw and could

334
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:15,362
not unsee. And because of his part in essentially

335
00:22:15,426 --> 00:22:18,666
letting this criminal go free. And this was

336
00:22:18,688 --> 00:22:21,498
something where they'd go to jail for the rest of their life. And there are

337
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:24,838
all sorts of other people involved and they could have uncovered things, whole ring of

338
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:28,782
people. If instead when he stumbled upon something, if he had

339
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:31,886
immediately called us, we could have taken care

340
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:35,534
of it. When you become an incident responder, you are

341
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:39,086
accepting a certain amount of risk. You understand you might

342
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,786
be exposed to things that are terrible. I did counterterrorism for a while

343
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:46,066
and I had nightmares all the time. And I have a lot

344
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:49,634
of respect for people who are able to do that work longer than I

345
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,846
did it. I could only do it a year and a half. And I was

346
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:55,538
like, my mental health can't handle this anymore. I can't

347
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:59,046
imagine things like that. They were outside of my scope of

348
00:22:59,068 --> 00:23:02,380
imagination, of awfulness. And so as a result,

349
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,900
I do softer, gentler, absec work. Now,

350
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,850
when you are an instant responder, we often

351
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,740
know when not to look. We know

352
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,422
how to manage the evidence so that we don't ruin it.

353
00:23:17,556 --> 00:23:21,054
We know what tools to use to collect things in a certain way.

354
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:24,458
And we know when to call the police.

355
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:28,194
And sometimes you just call the police right away.

356
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:32,674
And the thing you do is don't touch. And so we

357
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:36,706
agree to carry that burden. When we do things work, we agree to

358
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:40,174
it. You didn't agree to this.

359
00:23:40,232 --> 00:23:43,942
This isn't your burden to carry. So if you see

360
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:47,960
something, just call us and we will come and help.

361
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,720
It's not your job. You should not have to do this.

362
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,654
You should develop awesome software. You should patch

363
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:59,382
servers and harden them and make sure they're safe. You should monitor

364
00:23:59,446 --> 00:24:03,402
and log and check that everything is wonderful and that our products

365
00:24:03,456 --> 00:24:06,400
delight our customers. That's your job.

366
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,394
This stuff is for us. And we've agreed

367
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:14,222
to these terms when we accepted this position and you didn't. So please

368
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:17,534
don't try to be a hero. I know that you feel like you're helping,

369
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:20,654
but more often than not you're actually hurting.

370
00:24:20,782 --> 00:24:23,998
And sometimes the hurt is really serious.

371
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:27,922
And so with that, I wanted to just

372
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:32,038
have this here for you so that you have a second

373
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,040
so that you can take a look at that.

374
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,326
So I am putting this picture here for you

375
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:44,294
to take a screenshot if you want to. These are the five things that we

376
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:47,898
need you to know as incident responders. Tell us if you see something.

377
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:51,578
Don't leave the premises without telling us. If you are part of an

378
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:55,194
active incident, this is the top priority for you. If you are part

379
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:59,086
of the incident, if we've asked you for your help, please put everything else down.

380
00:24:59,268 --> 00:25:02,718
Follow need to know don't tell people that do not need

381
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:06,094
to know. It doesn't matter if they want to know. I don't care what they

382
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:09,586
want. Number four, do not try to manage it yourself and

383
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,186
be a hero. Please call us and we will take this burden from you and

384
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:16,580
we will handle it well. And with that,

385
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,720
whatever it happens with your software. If you are not sure,

386
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,886
ask the Appsec team. If they don't know at work.

387
00:25:28,988 --> 00:25:31,750
We hack purple community can help you, or Samgrep community.

388
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,834
So Samgrep bought Wehack Purple community. And so you might

389
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:39,734
be by the time, if you're watching this, after the live conference

390
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:43,180
in the coming weeks, we are moving to a new platform, but basically

391
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,534
join we hack Purple, the Samgrep community and attend way

392
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:51,386
more stuff like this. It is the security team's

393
00:25:51,418 --> 00:25:54,574
job to help you, right? So most of the time they can answer

394
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:57,280
your question. If they can't, we hack Purple can help.

395
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,654
It sounds weird, but I see them all helping each other all the time,

396
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,606
all the community members, and there's 8000 of us. So there's a lot of nerdy

397
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:08,034
help there. And with this, I'd like to lighten things up a bit

398
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:11,830
and give you some resources. So the first resource are

399
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,174
a whole bunch of books about DevOps and my book about

400
00:26:15,212 --> 00:26:19,298
appsec. So I feel we can't do security right if we're

401
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:22,614
not doing it right. And I feel that the

402
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:26,070
best way to build software is by following the DevOps principles,

403
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,766
by using the awesome kick ass tools, the awesome processes,

404
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:32,918
the really great products. I am a big fan of DevOps.

405
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:36,234
So those first four books are about developers and all of them

406
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:39,418
are awesome. And there's a new one called investments unlimited and it's

407
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:42,926
really, really great. And so I suggest that one too. And of

408
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:46,894
course Alice and Bob learn Appsec. Me and my mom agree best

409
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:50,730
book ever. Every single Monday

410
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,526
on Twitter, on Blue

411
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,014
sky, and on infosec exchange server

412
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:01,686
for Mastodon, I run a mentoring program. So I

413
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:05,522
don't pair people individually. People ask for a mentor

414
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:08,726
and then other people swoop in and answer them and help them.

415
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:12,086
Sometimes it's just a virtual coffee or a recommendation of

416
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:15,658
a book or join this local community or come to this event with me.

417
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:18,570
But sometimes it's a friendship that lasts for years,

418
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,186
and I've been doing it since 2018, and thousands of people

419
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:25,918
have met each other and formed friendships, formed companies,

420
00:27:26,084 --> 00:27:29,758
hired each other, taught each other, and grown and connected together.

421
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:33,434
And so I invite you to take advantage

422
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:37,200
of this small, tiny program that I do to try to help the community.

423
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,186
We hack purple community. Please come join us.

424
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:44,798
It's free. All the courses inside are free. All the events

425
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:48,642
that we hack purple. So sometimes we advertise external events that we like,

426
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:52,046
like the Diana initiative or Cyberjitsucon, et cetera.

427
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:55,480
But all the events by Wehag Purple and Sungrap are free.

428
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,494
And there's so many awesome humans and fun

429
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:02,854
things that we do together and share. So that is

430
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:06,618
one place. And then we are eventually moving over to somegraph community.

431
00:28:06,704 --> 00:28:09,466
So we don't have a platform yet, but we do have a newsletter which will

432
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:13,206
keep you up to date on literally everything. And we have a slack

433
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:16,534
channel for now where we can get you all set up with various

434
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:19,786
things and then if you just want to try it, you could just play with

435
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:23,174
the product because they have a free version. But basically, if you join the newsletter,

436
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:26,434
you will be invited to all of the cool events that we do do every

437
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:29,790
single month, which includes free trainings, workshops,

438
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,234
talks. We're hoping to arrange a tabletop exercise for

439
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:37,154
early next year and basically I get to have fun full time and it's pretty

440
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,350
great. Lastly,

441
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,126
resources me. So I have a website,

442
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:46,882
I have a blog, I have a YouTube, I have all the Twitters

443
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:49,590
and the Instas and all the socials.

444
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,654
If you see we hack purple, most of the time it's me. I do have

445
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:57,078
an imitator now at this point, which is really awkward and weird.

446
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:00,940
So I am not trying to sell you gambling, just to be clear,

447
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,886
but every single other thing is me. So if you look up Shehex

448
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:08,398
Purple, you will find lots of stuff, usually about the security

449
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:12,366
of software. And with that, I want to say thank you so much.

450
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:16,158
Thank you for one, being here and watching my talk.

451
00:29:16,244 --> 00:29:18,962
There's a lot of other things on the Internet you could be doing.

452
00:29:19,016 --> 00:29:22,866
There's probably several cute cat videos you haven't seen yet, but you

453
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:26,354
chose me instead. So thank you. Thank you to comp 42

454
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:29,554
for having me again. I really appreciate you.

455
00:29:29,592 --> 00:29:33,086
And I appreciate you making this really cool conference all about incident response

456
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:36,050
so I can learn more from my peers.

457
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,794
And thank you not only for watching, but for doing the work

458
00:29:39,832 --> 00:29:43,834
that you do. Because together we make it a

459
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:46,758
thing that fascinates, entertains,

460
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:49,722
takes care of, and serves the entire world.

461
00:29:49,856 --> 00:29:53,594
Pretty much almost every single person in the world is positively affected by what

462
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:57,226
our industry does. So thank you for your work, and thank you

463
00:29:57,248 --> 00:30:00,906
for trying to report security incidents from now on,

464
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,858
as soon as you see them. I'm Tanya Janca and I will see you

465
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:05,480
next time.
