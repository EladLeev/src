1
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,886
Hello everyone, I'm suzy. See you again. Today we

2
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:27,906
will dive deep into you, the intersection of AI and IoT.

3
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:31,686
Before we just start over today's session, I would

4
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:35,446
like to extend my gratitude to the Kong 44

5
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:39,354
who invite me to be here and meet all of you again.

6
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:43,642
Now let's begin. If you didn't watch

7
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:47,674
my previous videos or recordings, these is a little

8
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:51,482
bit about me. I'm currently working as a DevOps manager

9
00:00:51,546 --> 00:00:55,210
and software operations architect at signify

10
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,750
formerly famous lighting. Over the past three

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,038
years, I have deeply delved into and

12
00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:06,350
involved into these AI and machine learning,

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,314
etc. Which is why I'm here.

14
00:01:09,512 --> 00:01:13,394
And meanwhile, I'm also an irate contributor to

15
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:16,946
open source. So if you are curious, scan the QR

16
00:01:16,978 --> 00:01:20,294
code on the left side where you will gain my

17
00:01:20,332 --> 00:01:24,454
latest articles, speeches, and also my

18
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:28,634
upcoming technical books. So now,

19
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:32,262
first we'll discuss the AIot.

20
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,810
So what does it mean Iot?

21
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,582
Here Iot is. Iot is just a new term.

22
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:41,370
AI in Iot is Iot.

23
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,706
Here I just choose three examples.

24
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:49,454
It's quite practical examples for AI in

25
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:53,694
Iot. The first one, automated vehicles.

26
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,202
You may realize some brand is

27
00:01:57,256 --> 00:02:00,686
quite famous, right? For example like Tesla

28
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:04,930
Wimble is kind of for pioneers in this industry

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,790
and also smart city. For example like

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,154
lighting, our company is a lighting leader

31
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:16,674
and radio surveillance and monitoring traffic

32
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:21,210
and smart buildings for manufacturing.

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,254
They take advantage like deep learning and deep

34
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:28,794
neural networks to do the

35
00:02:28,912 --> 00:02:33,040
kind of product quality checks in production line.

36
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,142
And here I pick five use

37
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:41,630
case in real life AIop industry.

38
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,310
And for each part, for example like Niop,

39
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,590
it's a subfield for AI. Because for AI,

40
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,018
these have more than seven major

41
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,574
subfields. But here I pick five

42
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:01,698
to related AIot. So let's

43
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:04,680
dive into the first one.

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,842
Alexa, google Assistant, Siri, these are

45
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:12,842
all kind of virtual assistant. But you know,

46
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:17,340
in Iot we have some like a speaker, we can have

47
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,706
interaction with alexa, right? To light alexa,

48
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:25,310
this speaker to play videos or play

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,026
music or to implement

50
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:33,822
some tasks, et cetera. So they

51
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:37,540
take advantage like the NLP and also

52
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,874
for example like voice recognition model as well,

53
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:45,598
right? To achieve human being

54
00:03:45,784 --> 00:03:49,714
to interact with this kind of IoT

55
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:53,842
product. Second, expert systems,

56
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:57,474
take IBI Morsen for example. It has been

57
00:03:57,532 --> 00:04:01,354
utilized in

58
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:05,238
hospital and what they can do like medical

59
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:08,874
diagnosis is quite amazing and

60
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:13,294
also very practical. And number three,

61
00:04:13,412 --> 00:04:17,466
machine region, as I mentioned before, like neural

62
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:21,342
network and has been used for this

63
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:25,858
purpose. But here is machine region, it can be used in

64
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:29,902
production line to do this kind of production

65
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:34,066
quality checks. Number four, here it is,

66
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:37,946
planning is also one of these sub is one subfield

67
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:40,902
of AI self delving car.

68
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:44,982
They take advantage like applying AI technology to

69
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:48,930
navigate the routes. And it can help the driver.

70
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,002
It's a self driving car. IoT can help the driver to find

71
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:56,314
the best route. Number five

72
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:59,740
is quite amazing part.

73
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,854
For example like Boston dynamics sport robot. Have you

74
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:08,030
heard this news before? And it's really astonishing because

75
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,078
this robot can navigate terrain and also

76
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:15,890
to conduct like rescue missions

77
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,750
in dangerous situation. It will save human beings

78
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,010
life dramatically. It's really practical

79
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,822
in Iot. But if we think about

80
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:32,578
it for the Iot part, we take advantage.

81
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:35,830
AI technology, it's captivating.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,594
It's like AI technology. It's like a

83
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:43,706
coin with two sides. Now we just explore amazing

84
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:47,434
part of AI. But think about, it's not

85
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,402
like a traditional software, right? If our traditional

86
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:54,622
software, if it has been hacked by AI, it will

87
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:58,874
just cause your website downtime

88
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:03,118
or your financial losses. But if it coming

89
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:06,782
to the Iot, for example like this robots

90
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:10,978
or some machine or something

91
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:15,274
else, or increase your flies, your bedrooms

92
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:19,862
temperature more than 100

93
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:23,254
degree celsius, it will kill people, right?

94
00:06:23,372 --> 00:06:26,582
So we must prioritize the

95
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,914
Iot security, right? So now let's go

96
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:33,274
ahead AIot security. So we

97
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:37,034
will focus on how we can enhance security

98
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:40,010
in Iot. In AIot.

99
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,550
AI technology is

100
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,222
not new term. IoT has been coined in

101
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:53,300
1966, almost seven years ago.

102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,378
But you know, with the explosion of

103
00:06:57,464 --> 00:07:01,358
AI technologies, the current AI

104
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,054
security, the scope of AI security

105
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:08,966
will extend. It will expand very fast.

106
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:13,254
But we can still take advantage for the old security

107
00:07:13,372 --> 00:07:16,614
classification, right? For example, these. It is.

108
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:20,590
Look at the diagram and you will see there's

109
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,962
an overlap between Iot security and information

110
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,330
security. Is network security.

111
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,650
And network security belongs to cybersecurity.

112
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,002
And look at the cybersecurity. I think you are quite familiar with the cybersecurity

113
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:38,990
a lot, right? We got hacked all kind of

114
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,266
related to the information security. And cybersecurity belongs to

115
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:49,074
information security. These. It is Iot security has

116
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:52,274
been included in cybersecurity. What is

117
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:55,198
Iot? What's a Iot security?

118
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:58,934
For example, like a 5G networks, Internet for

119
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:02,390
vehicles and also industrial Iot.

120
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,742
When we just talk about industrial control system,

121
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:10,518
sorry, related to Iot,

122
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:14,998
we definitely need to refer to this term ICI.

123
00:08:15,174 --> 00:08:18,250
Iot means industrial control system.

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,234
So what is it? Look at the right side. There is a

125
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:25,866
timeline. Is ICI is a separate incident.

126
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:29,738
It's a real case happened since 19

127
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,018
three. Take one, for example, like 2012.

128
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:37,262
There is a campaign called Guys pipeline cyber intrusion

129
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:41,442
campaign. Think about it. This pipeline is

130
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:45,634
very crucial infrastructure or even a

131
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:49,694
nuclear industry. If they had

132
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:53,510
been kind of hacked by AI,

133
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,698
it will potentially not kill

134
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:01,078
a couple of persons. These will dramatically

135
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:05,898
destroy a city or even an entire country,

136
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:10,358
right. I think nobody will let

137
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:14,446
this kind of aiot out of our control.

138
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:18,734
Human beings control. So we definitely need to

139
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:22,802
prioritize Iot security as

140
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:26,020
much as possible, and also as soon as possible.

141
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,094
And when we talk about AIot

142
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:33,858
security, we definitely need to learn the AI security,

143
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:37,590
right? Because for Iot part

144
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,720
there is product, it's a real object just

145
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,638
send in front of you or just beside you.

146
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:48,822
And here is the AI technology,

147
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:52,490
or you can regard as AI model. These have interaction with

148
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,158
each other, the product and the AI part. Between AI

149
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:01,566
model and also these Iot object, our product

150
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,246
devices, et cetera. And we must make

151
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:08,894
sure the connection cybersecurity, right?

152
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:12,240
And also we need make sure the data security, right?

153
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,226
Yeah. These is between these AI model and

154
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:20,322
Iot devices. But we must make sure

155
00:10:20,456 --> 00:10:23,970
for the AI part, also the IoT part,

156
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,622
both the security, they can make sure themselves

157
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:31,446
secure, right? So for AI part, here is these

158
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:33,910
is some list about AI security.

159
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,742
Like first data security, definitely privacy

160
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:42,810
preservation, because it's related to the AI part and

161
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,730
information security. And also explainability,

162
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,654
transparency. Because we

163
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,602
are kind of AI, this technology or model or machine

164
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:58,766
informed of human being is kind of a black box.

165
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:02,570
We must make sure everything expandable

166
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,042
and also transparent. Otherwise it has been trained

167
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:08,900
by, for example,

168
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,800
what should I say the very, by the purpose or

169
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,974
malicious purpose. Wow. You couldn't imagine this

170
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,654
machine can go, can take which direction, right?

171
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:28,026
Iot may be just do some very evil stuff.

172
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:31,482
We do not want this kind of thing happen into

173
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:35,514
the reality. And Iot security has

174
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:39,162
been included in AI security as well. And also

175
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:42,814
human AI interaction. Security model security

176
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:47,610
with the AI explosion, I mean, AI technology explosion,

177
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,894
we will see more and more model

178
00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:54,670
will be launched. So definitely model

179
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,986
security and the best finance security. We are

180
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:02,882
human being living in

181
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:06,742
a world with different cultures, civilization and

182
00:12:06,796 --> 00:12:10,086
even different religions, right? So we

183
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:13,762
found the machine. It's just a box. Oh, it's just a machine.

184
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:17,014
It's some. We are human being to give them

185
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:20,666
data, to train them to get the

186
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:23,100
result. What we are looking forward,

187
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,770
what do we expect, right? So we definitely make sure

188
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,690
there's a bears and fairness.

189
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,046
These barriers and fairness can be solved. These cannot be

190
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:39,754
exploited by malicious purpose and lifecycle

191
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:44,010
security and regulatory compliance, hybrid AI

192
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,720
human security. For each of these,

193
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:51,154
we definitely need to make sure the

194
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:55,278
AI part is secure and also, we will make sure our

195
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:58,518
Iot devices, for example,

196
00:12:58,604 --> 00:13:01,190
like firmware and hardware,

197
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,130
as we all know, our apps or software,

198
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:12,042
they have bots. We definitely need make sure our

199
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:15,258
IoT product has kind

200
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:19,066
of a regular update and fix kind of

201
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:23,070
for potential vulnerability box,

202
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,560
right? And for the AI part, no matter,

203
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,814
we are in Iot, sorry, we are in

204
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:34,062
IoT industry or any industry,

205
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:36,180
for AI side,

206
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,380
for everyone. We need prioritize this AI security.

207
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,038
But today we talk about AIot, right? So for

208
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:48,694
the IoT part, we need to make sure the

209
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:52,886
regular updates and between both of them

210
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:56,678
and these cybersecurity and also the data security,

211
00:13:56,844 --> 00:14:00,406
et cetera, right? So now

212
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:04,422
here's a summary. We talk about alt definition

213
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:08,490
and these real life use case in reality,

214
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,318
and also the information security IoT security

215
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:15,600
in AI and also AI security definition, right?

216
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,230
I think we just talk about all kinds of AIoT

217
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,506
stuff. Some very astonishing use

218
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,646
case it has been applied in reality.

219
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:34,020
And see, even for example, like that robotics can

220
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,510
conduct a rescue.

221
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,974
Okay? And so another part, we need to

222
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:49,826
care about the AI security very much because it's

223
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:53,162
not like software, right? It's some

224
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:56,778
object kind of interact with a

225
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:59,942
human being directly. And also the infrastructure

226
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:02,970
like nuclear industry,

227
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,270
ICIs, this kind of thing. So do

228
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,494
we definitely need to prioritize the

229
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:14,110
AI security, especially in IoT?

230
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,982
I hope you all enjoyed this talk and

231
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:22,254
maybe get a little bit inspiration. I will be very

232
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:25,206
grateful and thank you. See you soon.
