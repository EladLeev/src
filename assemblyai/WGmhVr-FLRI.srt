1
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,094
Hey everyone, how is it going? I hope you are all doing good. This is

2
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:30,562
Harika Chebrolu, working as a senior software engineer in Red Hat.

3
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:34,146
So in this talk we will be going to discuss about how AI

4
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:37,462
can be leveraged by energy industry to accelerate the smart green

5
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:40,998
transition. So the main agenda that we will be going to cover in

6
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:44,918
this session are the problem statement. That is what are we trying to solve and

7
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,470
why are we doing this then how are we going to solve this? Using training

8
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,886
and production ML pipeline and the sample solution architecture to

9
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:55,514
solve this problem. So now coming to the problem statement,

10
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:59,840
so we all know that by burning coal, gas and oil for our energy needs,

11
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,526
we are adding carbon to the atmosphere which is tapping

12
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,354
the solar heat control which

13
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:10,530
is contributing to the global warming.

14
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,074
And we also know that we are looking

15
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:18,722
for a ways to go green and protect the earth.

16
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:22,150
So I believe one of the most excellent ways to go about it is having

17
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,350
solar panels. Solar panels. So we

18
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,126
know that solar panels doesn't absorb heat from

19
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:32,806
the sun and it does not penetrate the heat into the buildings and keeping

20
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:37,450
the earth cool and also the building cool and

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,274
it will direct the sun rays away from the house. And we also

22
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:45,230
know that solar energy is very promising and

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,214
freely available resource which

24
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:51,840
will not be ended anytime soon.

25
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,494
So that's the reason we have the increasing attention on

26
00:01:56,532 --> 00:02:00,014
solar energy as

27
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:03,406
a renewable source of energy. But the problem is

28
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:07,446
there is no proper knowledge and

29
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:11,510
viable information on installing the solar panels on the rooftops.

30
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,002
So that means the investors

31
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:19,386
or the policymakers and the electricity and

32
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:23,514
the railway department departments doesn't have the enough information to

33
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:26,822
come up with the viable solar energy investments

34
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,610
which are sustainable and cost effective.

35
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,838
Hence high potential solar investments are remaining

36
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:38,570
as an deployed. So along with it, the installation

37
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,258
and understanding the rooftop efficacy

38
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:46,574
is also a very cumbersome and time consuming

39
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:50,194
process and which will take at least one to two

40
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:53,774
day full day to calculate the solar protection of each rooftop

41
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:57,426
and which is increasing

42
00:02:57,458 --> 00:03:01,590
the revenue of the solar economics.

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,302
This has resulted to the cost of sales

44
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:11,450
taking up to 30% to 40% of the total project

45
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,706
cost, significantly worsening the unit economics of

46
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:19,114
solar projects. So for this, if we come

47
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:23,214
up with the smart system that can help

48
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:26,830
to improve the integration of renewables in an effective way,

49
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,414
will solve all these problems and also it will

50
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:33,650
decrease the global warming.

51
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,790
For this we can detect the rooftops

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,738
and give the understandable rooftop classification to accelerate

53
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:49,686
the growth of the solar installation in a given area in order to

54
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:53,666
identify the potential of facilities solar installation depending

55
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:56,594
on the uncluttered surface area and direction, location,

56
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:59,130
surroundings, color, material,

57
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,290
et cetera. So we can consider these

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,610
data points as an input to calculate the solar

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,434
potential. And as an output we can give the optimal location

60
00:04:11,482 --> 00:04:14,782
to place the solar installation to have the high

61
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:18,574
emission of, I mean to have

62
00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:22,126
the high energy consumption but with

63
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:25,666
less carbon emission. So we

64
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:29,940
can provide this deep engine product, so deep engine vision product

65
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,158
to the battery owners or to the property owners so that

66
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:39,526
they can utilize this to

67
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:42,966
get the optimal location of the solar panels and also they

68
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:47,110
can decrease the investment on time and also on the money and

69
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,686
also with less carbon emission. So that's

70
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:54,618
what we are trying to solve in this way.

71
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:58,310
So for this we need a training and prediction phase

72
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,934
like every ML pipeline has. So in

73
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:05,822
this training phase we'll have the rooftops images data set

74
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,986
as an input which are completely unlabeled

75
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:12,334
and not preprocessed. So we will extract the

76
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:15,426
features of those images after having property,

77
00:05:15,528 --> 00:05:19,060
preprocessing and annotating them and

78
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,470
removing noises and brightening the images,

79
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,498
doing all the image preprocessing techniques,

80
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:29,826
we can extract the features and after extracting

81
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:33,862
features we can calculate the available rooftop area

82
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:37,414
and we will send those data sets along with

83
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:40,838
this data to the training, to the

84
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:44,214
training phase. So here we can follow the batch

85
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:47,446
process. That means 70% of the data we'd be sending

86
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:50,606
to the training and remaining 30% of the data we can send it to the

87
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:54,560
testing. So after application of

88
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,440
proper training algorithm and after optimizing the

89
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,750
training data set incrementally,

90
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,150
we would get one trained model and we can validate

91
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,386
that trained model by the

92
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:14,434
use of remaining 30% of the data set. So this

93
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:18,054
will come under training phase and now coming to the prediction. So by

94
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:22,630
now we had a trained model already. Now we need to validate

95
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,062
or to check whether our trained model is

96
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:30,570
doing training property on the unseen data set. So we have

97
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,866
already unseen data set. I mean we have

98
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:37,274
kept this unseen data set aside. Now we use that unseen data

99
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:38,940
set for this prediction process.

100
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,280
So after running,

101
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,726
after running the algorithm or the model on top of

102
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:53,422
this unseen data set, we would get one energy variable as an output.

103
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:57,246
So through which we can estimate the optimal

104
00:06:57,278 --> 00:07:01,490
location to install the solar panels.

105
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,182
So along with it. So we will

106
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:09,494
be getting this energy variable depending on

107
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:13,910
various factors which would get trained based on those factors

108
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,390
which I have already mentioned like surroundings,

109
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,718
material, available, rooftop area and the type of rooftop

110
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:25,370
and surroundings, et cetera.

111
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,942
So coming to the solution architecture, as I have already mentioned.

112
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,658
So we would be getting the rooftop data which was completely unlabeled

113
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:37,774
and dropped. Now we need to clean

114
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:41,866
that image data set for the algorithm to detect

115
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:45,714
the features properly. So for that, first we need to annotate the

116
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:50,034
data, like annotating the material, annotating the type

117
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:54,222
of rooftop and whatever is required

118
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:58,962
for the further process, we need to annotate them. Then after annotation

119
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:02,982
those annotated images data set would be going

120
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:06,630
to preprocessing and the noise remover stage where we do

121
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,918
all the whitening or the grayscaling and

122
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:14,426
removing the watermarks and all those things we'll be doing as

123
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:17,610
a part of the stage. So those cleaned images,

124
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,602
we will be using these cleaned images in the olact

125
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:25,950
segmentation model where we will segment the images

126
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,762
and also we will classify the images into these four types, that is flat,

127
00:08:30,826 --> 00:08:34,702
heavy, industrial, low, uncluttered and existing solar. So we will classify

128
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:38,594
the rooftop as flat. If there is no equipments on

129
00:08:38,632 --> 00:08:42,050
the rooftop, and if it is completely flat, completely plate,

130
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,942
we will classify the rooftop as heavy industrial as if it has

131
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:49,874
more equipments, more pipes, et cetera.

132
00:08:49,922 --> 00:08:54,262
So if it has in that structure, then we

133
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:57,782
classify that rooftop as heavy industrial. So if

134
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:01,574
the rooftop has very few equipments, very few

135
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:04,778
pipes, then we will classify that that as low cluster. If the

136
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:08,602
rooftop has already a solar panel installed on it, then we classify that

137
00:09:08,656 --> 00:09:12,246
as an existing solar. So after applying

138
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:15,834
the OLAT segmentation model, we would get the segmented

139
00:09:15,882 --> 00:09:19,754
image as an output and we would be using this segmented

140
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:23,854
image for the further process. Something like calculating

141
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:27,074
the rooftop area, available rooftop area.

142
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:30,786
Sorry. And for predicting the material and

143
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:34,302
for the prediction of color. And we would be using all these factors

144
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:38,594
for the calculating of energy. So we can calculate

145
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,958
the available rooftop area using mask r

146
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:46,550
can algorithm or the grayscaling algorithm.

147
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,894
Depending on the images and depending on the accuracy, we can use

148
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:55,526
any of these algorithms and then we will calculate

149
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:59,722
the material and the color. So for the color we can use CIE 76

150
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:03,242
algorithm and for the material. So we would be already

151
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:06,446
allotating the data. For the material we

152
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:09,790
can use that label data and using k means clustering,

153
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,090
we can detect the material for the rooftop provided in the given

154
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,900
image. And based on these factors, we can calculate the energy

155
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,782
produced based on the few factors

156
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:26,950
provided, which would be provided by the electricity department

157
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,422
as an output, we would be getting an energy and we can

158
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:38,182
ingest all this entire model into

159
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,990
an engine or into some project. And we can deliver this product to the

160
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,970
energy departments or the railway and electricity

161
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,966
departments and they can use this model to get

162
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:54,926
the output based on which they

163
00:10:54,948 --> 00:11:00,430
can decide the place where they can install the solar panels to get the efficacy

164
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,926
of the solar energy. Thereby we can reduce the global warming and

165
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:08,814
also the carbon emission. Yeah. So that's it from my end.

166
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:09,340
Thank you.
