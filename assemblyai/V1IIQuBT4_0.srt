1
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,074
Hi, I'm Dol. And today we're going to talk about a team that

2
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:15,834
rises from a rises. And in order to do that,

3
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:18,540
I want to start with a small story.

4
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,758
Let's say, I'm sure you're familiar

5
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:26,666
with this. The sky is clear, the grass

6
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:29,680
is green, everything is great.

7
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,014
You're in your car, traveling to your work, everything is

8
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:37,794
just superb. Your new feature just

9
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:41,682
got up yesterday, and the customers are using it. And happy,

10
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:45,490
your product manager is happy, your own manager is happy,

11
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,934
everyone is just happy. Until you

12
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:56,294
have a bug. Now, you don't know exactly

13
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:59,986
when it started, you don't know exactly where, but you're

14
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:04,406
seeing a tremendous amount in support calls.

15
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,486
And you notice when you arrive to the office that three of your teammates

16
00:03:08,518 --> 00:03:11,260
are looking at the same screen. And you know that's bad news.

17
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,454
So when did it happen?

18
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:19,406
Okay. I mean, like yesterday, you were okay,

19
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:23,230
everything was great. But now this is what you're dealing with,

20
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,910
right? And think about it. We all know

21
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,994
we're going to have bugs in the future, right? We all know we

22
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:34,866
had bugs in the past. But let me ask you this. Do you

23
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:38,690
know when does your next bug will occur?

24
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,494
Do you know where? Do you know what kind

25
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:45,480
of effect will it have on your product?

26
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,418
Weird, right? Because you know that there's going to be a bug.

27
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:53,858
You're certain about it, but you don't know where.

28
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:57,738
You dont know where, you dont know nothing, right? But it

29
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,754
doesn't have to be a bug. It can be your best employee saying

30
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:06,286
goodbye and leaving for his startup. It can be a

31
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:10,286
pivot you have to do in the product because the market demands it

32
00:04:10,308 --> 00:04:13,358
could be a million things. My point is,

33
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:17,200
shit happens, right? And today,

34
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,994
this is just what we're going to talk about. We don't know

35
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:24,146
when, we don't know where, but we know it's going to happen.

36
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:28,146
And the essence of this talk is how we're going to

37
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,382
deal with it. So, hi, I'm Dole. And today

38
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:36,258
we're going to talk about your teams and how will it affect

39
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:39,542
the next rises. So, a few words

40
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:44,250
about me. I'm married with Elle and father of Ayala.

41
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,122
I'm a senior software engineer. I've been around nine

42
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:51,994
years, give or take, in various amount of teams. And this is

43
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:55,600
amount of incidents I had to deal with, so to say.

44
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,430
Okay, so now that we've introduced,

45
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,638
let's talk about the reason why we're here. So basically,

46
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:08,240
we sailing in rough waters, right? We know that,

47
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,918
and we don't know when the storm is going to hit us. We don't

48
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:15,618
know where, but we know it will. It's out there waiting for us.

49
00:05:15,784 --> 00:05:19,186
And the question is not when it's going

50
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,600
to be. The question is, how will this affect your team?

51
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,206
And by asking these questions, I actually want

52
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:31,110
to ask another question. The lead question I want to ask is

53
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,970
how resilient your team is for this kind of storm.

54
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,980
Okay. Because it's out there. We know that.

55
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,922
So in order to answer this question, I want to answer three

56
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:46,414
smaller questions or maybe address

57
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:50,266
three issues. The first is growth culture,

58
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:54,206
which stands for, can your team really absorbs the

59
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,140
shock? Okay. The second,

60
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,266
does your team can handle the incident? I. E, can the

61
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:06,498
team respond to the shock? And the third,

62
00:06:06,664 --> 00:06:10,370
rise. Can your team evolve from the shock?

63
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,406
Okay, three questions. So the

64
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:18,294
first one, growth culture. Growth culture is

65
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:21,110
the foundation of every going organization.

66
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,786
It's a set of skills and principles that

67
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:29,226
every organization depends on. And basically,

68
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:32,794
this is the first thing that determines how will

69
00:06:32,832 --> 00:06:36,474
your teams reflect this incident

70
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,880
and how will this affect it.

71
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,086
There are a few principles I want to discuss,

72
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:46,000
and the first thing is to focus on learning.

73
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,538
What does it actually mean? Focus on learning means

74
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:55,566
that you want to make sure every day that tomorrow you'll

75
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,460
be a bit better than you were today.

76
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,006
It's true for yourself, it's true for your team. It's true for

77
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:05,880
your company. It's true basically everywhere you look around.

78
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,054
But how do you do that? So the first thing you might

79
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:13,034
think about is online recesses, right?

80
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:17,126
You have courses, you have books, you have lectures, you have meetups,

81
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:20,618
you have whatever. Everything is available

82
00:07:20,784 --> 00:07:23,754
nowadays for free or for minor price.

83
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:27,386
And it's out there just waiting for you to reach and grab

84
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:31,198
it. Do it. You don't know the tremendous effect

85
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,400
it will make both on you and your team.

86
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,930
The second thing I want to talk about is guilds.

87
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:43,394
Now, what actually a guild is, a guild is a group

88
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:46,978
of people with a certain domain that come together

89
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:50,390
and talk about a certain subject. They ask questions,

90
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,550
they discuss things. They try to get to improve.

91
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,350
Now, if your company does not have a guild, start one today.

92
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,886
Don't wait. The people around you are waiting

93
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,626
for this kind of platform, and the

94
00:08:07,648 --> 00:08:11,066
sooner you do that, the better. Now, this doesn't have

95
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:14,186
to be necessarily with your own people from your own team or

96
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:18,382
your own company. This could be in the form of meetups where

97
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:22,238
you can meet with people from other companies and discuss

98
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:26,170
their issues, which I'm guessing quite similar to your issues,

99
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,810
and think about the way you can resolve things.

100
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,666
Learn from experience of others, share some of your own

101
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,298
great work. Now these are all

102
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:41,080
pretty standard ideas, but I want to talk about a few more.

103
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,174
For starters, system design, or let's say

104
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:48,582
system documentation. Okay. Think about

105
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:52,762
it. You're in a company. You have a product, a big one, a massive one,

106
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:56,262
complex one. It does tremendous

107
00:08:56,326 --> 00:09:00,714
work. It does all kinds of. But have

108
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:04,006
you ever stopped and read that it's documentation?

109
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:07,866
Have you ever stopped and read its entire capabilities,

110
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:11,726
whether it's weak spots, its strong spots, what it can do,

111
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:14,814
what it cannot do? Think about it. This could

112
00:09:14,852 --> 00:09:18,238
be a great way to see, to look for the next storm.

113
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:22,034
Okay, the next thing I want to talk about is

114
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:25,842
design reviews. Design reviews is a way for you

115
00:09:25,896 --> 00:09:29,794
to tell people what you plan to do before you do it.

116
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:33,094
You address an issue, you find a solution, and before

117
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:36,406
you start to implement it, you present it to your team,

118
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:40,390
to your manager, to everyone relevant to this issue.

119
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,038
You're saying this is the problem and this is how we're

120
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:47,882
going to face it. These are the drawbacks. These are the strong

121
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:50,966
parts. This is my solution.

122
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,486
And then you wait. You wait for the feedback.

123
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,126
You wait for people to tell you you should look at this part.

124
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:01,280
You wait for people to tell you, I don't think this is possible.

125
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,626
You wait for the drawbacks and they improve

126
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:08,990
your solution. Do that before you start to implement,

127
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,810
not after, because then it gets incredibly harder.

128
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,398
The last but not least thing I want to talk about in this subject

129
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:21,398
is tests. Think about it.

130
00:10:21,564 --> 00:10:25,446
Tests are your best way to connect with the mind of the person

131
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:29,222
who wrote the code you're dealing with. It's as if

132
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:33,146
he's telling you, this is what I meant for this code to

133
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:35,420
do. This is what I want to check.

134
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,478
This is what considered to be a good behavior.

135
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:43,482
This is what's considered to be a bad behavior, okay?

136
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:47,030
Whether if this person is one of your teams, one of

137
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,494
your teammates, or even you from the past and you don't remember why you did

138
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:54,110
what you did. Read the test, not just pass them.

139
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,614
Okay? It will give you a clear view what the writer

140
00:10:57,662 --> 00:11:01,902
meant for. And finally schedule

141
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:04,866
a time for it. I cannot stress this enough,

142
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:08,334
schedule a time for this. If it's not in your calendar,

143
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:12,050
it does not exist. Okay? Make a slot

144
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,510
every week, every day. I don't know. It doesn't matter.

145
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,538
A few hours every week that you invest in these areas,

146
00:11:19,634 --> 00:11:22,790
it will get you better. It will help you improve.

147
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,986
The person you will be tomorrow is much better than

148
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:30,614
the person you are today. Please schedule

149
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:34,462
time for it. The second point

150
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:38,350
is continuous communication. Continuous communication

151
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,426
starts with basically communication

152
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,000
and open communication. What does it mean?

153
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,466
Open communication means that you feel free

154
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:53,380
to tell people what you think.

155
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,926
I know it sounds simple. You'll be surprised

156
00:11:57,038 --> 00:12:00,626
in how many teams. That's not the case. Tell people what

157
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:04,214
you think. You think this feature is wrong. Tell them you

158
00:12:04,252 --> 00:12:07,814
think this solution is too complex. Tell them you

159
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,422
think we have a problem that we don't see today but we'll see tomorrow.

160
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:15,322
Tell them open communication is one of

161
00:12:15,376 --> 00:12:18,714
the pillars for a team that evolves and

162
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:21,990
grows and improves.

163
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,510
Okay? You have to feel safe to talk your ideas.

164
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,806
The second thing is clear goals. When you

165
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:35,422
are given a goal or when you give a goal, both you

166
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:39,234
and your manager should know what the outcome should look

167
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:43,650
like. Again, simple. I know, but you'll be surprised.

168
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,226
Both you and your manager should know what your goal is,

169
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:51,762
how you plan to implement it and what will the final

170
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:55,254
outcome will look like. It's as if he's telling you to train

171
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,614
a horse and you draw a dog instead. You don't want to do that.

172
00:12:58,732 --> 00:13:02,090
Okay? You want to set clear goals and you want everyone

173
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,060
to know what it is that you are changing to do

174
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,420
and how will you achieve that.

175
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,302
Another thing is transparency. This is super

176
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:17,742
important. You don't want to hide the

177
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,374
bad stuff. You don't want to. Don't talk about

178
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:24,926
the weak spots. You want to be transparent as possible.

179
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:28,626
If something is too complex, tell the

180
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:32,594
people about it. If you made an error, if your

181
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:36,722
data is corrupted, if your system is not going to stand

182
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:40,760
the overload, talk about it. If something happens,

183
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,354
communicate it. Okay? This is the ground

184
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:48,102
rules of communication. You need to talk about the bad

185
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:51,302
things as well as the good things. And this is super

186
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:55,018
important to be as transparent as possible. Not just in your own team,

187
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:58,746
but with other teams as well. If your

188
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:02,554
team made something, it affect another team, tell them

189
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,800
about it before they find out themselves.

190
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,702
Okay? And the final thing

191
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,920
in this subject is regular check ins.

192
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,478
By regular check ins I mean talk with the people

193
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,460
in your team and ask them how are they?

194
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,662
Are they okay? Are they feeling well? Is the subject

195
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:27,266
they're trying to deal with the last week or

196
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:30,418
so is bothering them. Do they need any help?

197
00:14:30,584 --> 00:14:34,246
Okay. You'll be surprised with some of the answers you may hear.

198
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:37,782
Make sure you do this on a regular basis and not just once

199
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,122
a year when you have to. Okay? This is super crucial.

200
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:45,242
This is super important. You want the people in your team to be happy.

201
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:48,858
You want to know that they enjoy the work you're doing. You want to

202
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:52,938
know they understand the work they're doing and why they're doing it.

203
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:56,926
Okay. And why not something else? This is super important,

204
00:14:57,108 --> 00:15:00,782
and you want to make sure every once in a while that everything is okay

205
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,480
as you expect it to be.

206
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,650
The next point I want to talk about is supportive environment.

207
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,862
Now, what does that actually mean? Supportive environment,

208
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:16,690
again, is with the culture of your team. It takes a long

209
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,934
time to build it, but once you have it, it is a strong tool that

210
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:24,534
you want to hold on. How can you do that?

211
00:15:24,732 --> 00:15:28,230
By first, you want to encourage collaboration. You want people

212
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,702
to work with each other. You want people to understand

213
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:35,354
each other's ideas. You dont want one person walking on

214
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,826
something and the next day another person trying to work

215
00:15:38,848 --> 00:15:42,314
with it and doesn't understand what the hell is going on

216
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:46,190
and why that person did what he did. You want people working together,

217
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,726
talking the same language, understanding the same problems,

218
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,960
working together and solving them. Okay?

219
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,190
The next thing you want to do is provide support and resources.

220
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,110
If you have a teammate that struggles on some mission

221
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,002
and needs help, help them. If someone needs

222
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:09,846
an extra time or an extra tool or skill or

223
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,702
whatever, help them make them better,

224
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:17,350
because if they're better, your team is better. Okay,

225
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,186
straight up. If they are better, your team is better,

226
00:16:21,308 --> 00:16:25,066
and you want to give them all the tools and resources you can

227
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:26,860
in order to make that happen.

228
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,370
The next thing is to forego blame.

229
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,674
Let's say something did happen. Something broke, something was corrupted,

230
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:40,000
something was. I don't know, things happened all the time.

231
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,094
You don't want to look for the person responsible for it.

232
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,474
You don't want to look at the past. You want to look at the future.

233
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:51,870
What will we learn from it? How can we use this to improve

234
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,540
next time? How can we make sure this will not happen?

235
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,990
Okay. These are the questions that will help you lower

236
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,814
the chances that this will happen again. Not who did

237
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:07,126
this and should we fire him? This is not

238
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:10,600
helping anyone, especially not your product. Okay.

239
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,194
In order to improve your product, you need to learn from these mistakes and

240
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:17,450
not looking for the person who didn't.

241
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,698
The next point I want to address is experimentation,

242
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,910
or space for experimentation.

243
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,774
What does that mean? So you have your team,

244
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:35,974
and you're working on your solution, and you're advancing

245
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:39,746
with it, and it's going well, but you want to keep

246
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:44,306
enabling these parts of the work as well. What does that mean?

247
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:46,370
You want to encourage creativity.

248
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,854
Just because you have something that works does not

249
00:17:50,892 --> 00:17:54,706
mean it cannot work better. Okay? You cannot

250
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:57,318
improve it. Now,

251
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:01,086
beware of premature optimization, because that's a lesson

252
00:18:01,138 --> 00:18:03,978
we all should learn. But basically,

253
00:18:04,144 --> 00:18:07,382
just because something works does not mean it cannot

254
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:11,050
work better or faster or cheaper or,

255
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,926
I don't know, maybe there's a way to improve it. And the

256
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:18,442
best way to find out is to be creative.

257
00:18:18,586 --> 00:18:22,494
Try look for new angles, new solutions. Maybe we can do

258
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:26,660
something today we could not do before. Think about it.

259
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:32,206
The next point I want to address is the resources

260
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:35,762
and time again, like in the last point

261
00:18:35,816 --> 00:18:39,682
I said, you want to provide your researchers,

262
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:43,094
your team, the people who is in charge of this

263
00:18:43,132 --> 00:18:46,678
task, the means to do so. Okay?

264
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:50,834
If something is a bit complex, if something requires

265
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:54,662
a new approach, give people time to investigate.

266
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:59,066
Give people the tools they need in order for them to provide with

267
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:02,682
a full solution and not something they made just

268
00:19:02,736 --> 00:19:06,382
to make you happy. Okay? If you give people

269
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,218
the confidence and the feeling

270
00:19:10,314 --> 00:19:13,614
that they can do and whatever they want,

271
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:17,306
and explore new boundaries, within limits, of course, but explore

272
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:21,220
new boundaries, you'll be amazed how much

273
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,100
progress it will achieve for you.

274
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,766
The last thing I want to talk about is the culture of

275
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:33,190
the teams and the continuous improvement of it,

276
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,694
okay? Again, just because something is

277
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:40,070
working does not mean it could not work better.

278
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,922
Now you want to do it on your own level, on the team level,

279
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:45,340
on the company level. Okay?

280
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,846
You want to always ask yourself, can we improve?

281
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:53,498
Can we do better? Why are we doing what we're doing today?

282
00:19:53,664 --> 00:19:56,862
Are we sure this is the best solution? Or was

283
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,046
this the quickest solution we can find? And we

284
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:03,150
quickly moved on. You'll be surprised.

285
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,042
Sometimes you'll go and you find something in your code or

286
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:11,170
your project or whatever that's been there for years because

287
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,846
someone meant for it to change one day and that simply

288
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:18,414
didn't happen. Okay? And you can

289
00:20:18,472 --> 00:20:22,514
achieve from it. You can grow from it. Continuous improvement

290
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:26,194
culture is a major tool in your toolbox

291
00:20:26,322 --> 00:20:29,590
that enables you to move on and progress.

292
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,740
The next point. Sorry,

293
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,726
the next point I want to talk about is empower champions.

294
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:42,780
Okay? What does that mean?

295
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,760
Traditionally, we used to talk about, or we talk about a lot about

296
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,726
bad things, when things break, when things need

297
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:55,790
to be removed, to be fixed, to be changed, to be improved,

298
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,910
how often do you talk about the good things, the achievements,

299
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,034
the progress, the people who made them?

300
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:07,746
Okay. Now, empowering champions can be done in

301
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:10,390
a lot of ways. First of all,

302
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,174
celebrate victories. Okay?

303
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,902
If someone made a goal, he deserves to dance after

304
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:21,014
it. Okay? Messi can tell you that need

305
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:24,314
to recognize the team achievements and talk about them and talk

306
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:28,170
with other teams about them for them to learn and improve.

307
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,106
You want to share success stories. You want for the

308
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:35,934
people who've been in the trenches to talk about it and how they made

309
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:39,102
it out. Okay? It will inspire the people

310
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:42,430
in your organization. It will give great motivation.

311
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,046
It will give the people the thing they need. You want

312
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:52,114
to take time to reflect about it. It could be once

313
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:55,426
a week, once a month, once in a quarter, once in whatever.

314
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:58,842
Okay? But you want to share and celebrate

315
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:03,110
the success stories. You deserved it. You made it. It's yours.

316
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,790
The next point I want to talk is task pitching now.

317
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,426
Okay, think about this scenario. You're at the

318
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:16,346
beginning of your sprint of your quarter. I don't

319
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,946
know. But at some point you

320
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:23,934
think about the new tasks and goals you want to achieve and you give

321
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:27,214
them. If your manager giving you the tasks, if you're giving

322
00:22:27,252 --> 00:22:30,170
the tasks to your employees,

323
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,360
basically orders come from up below.

324
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,420
But what if they work the other way around?

325
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,306
What if your employees could pitch some of the

326
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:46,114
tasks to you? Okay, what does

327
00:22:46,152 --> 00:22:49,006
that mean? Like, let's say every sprint,

328
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,246
you talk with your employees and you decide to do. You want to do a,

329
00:22:52,268 --> 00:22:55,750
b and c, but what if you save a place

330
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,334
D, where your employees can say,

331
00:22:59,532 --> 00:23:03,194
we noticed that there is a problem in this area and we know that

332
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,906
people are afraid of touching it, and maybe we can change that.

333
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:11,014
Or you remember the bug we had earlier

334
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:14,874
and it caused some disruptions in

335
00:23:14,912 --> 00:23:19,434
something. Let's take a look at that. Or remember that algorithm

336
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,134
we said we wanted to explore? Let's do

337
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:26,554
that. Now, by giving your employees

338
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:30,782
the opportunity to pitch their tasks, you're basically giving

339
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:34,846
them a sense of responsibility because it's

340
00:23:34,878 --> 00:23:38,562
their own tasks. They pitched it, they made it,

341
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:42,200
they present it to the team. And if the team or you

342
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,134
decide to accept that pitch, great. It goes

343
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,994
on the board and it's a proper task.

344
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:52,474
But it's not a task that you gave and your employees now

345
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:56,220
need to do. It's a task that your employee gave to themselves.

346
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,826
Okay? The feeling of

347
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:04,686
commitment, the feeling of responsibility. The ownership of

348
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:08,078
this task is much higher. Okay,

349
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:09,440
think about it.

350
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,586
The next part I want to talk about is lead hackathons.

351
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:18,242
And I'm pointing this with

352
00:24:18,296 --> 00:24:21,902
a dot here because it does not have to always be hackathons.

353
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:24,260
It can be initiatives in general.

354
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,290
Okay. It relates to the point we just talked about.

355
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,470
But basically you want to give your employees stronger sense

356
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,498
of ownership, stronger sense of responsibility.

357
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:39,720
Now, hackathons are a great way because you can take

358
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:44,882
the junior employee and make him the team lead of your manager,

359
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:48,554
for example. But it doesn't have to be a hackathon. It could

360
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:53,218
be any initiative someone in your team is trying to advance,

361
00:24:53,414 --> 00:24:56,160
help them with that, teach them with that,

362
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,990
make them become more responsible

363
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,118
for that action. It will make them feel

364
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:08,994
much more empowerful in the organization and much

365
00:25:09,032 --> 00:25:12,226
more sense of this is done because

366
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:16,066
I wanted it done. I wanted it to be done. And this is

367
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:20,166
what we came up with. Great, great success story to

368
00:25:20,188 --> 00:25:22,920
celebrate. Think about it.

369
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,270
So, let's recap.

370
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,762
We said we want to focus on learning. We want to keep advanced

371
00:25:31,826 --> 00:25:35,574
and enrich our knowledge. We want to have

372
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:38,826
a continuous communication. We want the team, the people in

373
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:42,362
the team could be able to talk with each other and have an open

374
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,130
communication as well with other teams.

375
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,206
We want to have a supportive environment. We want people to

376
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:53,886
not be afraid to make mistakes. We want people to know that

377
00:25:53,908 --> 00:25:57,550
it's a safe place that can advance

378
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,340
with. They can be bigger with. Okay,

379
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,826
we want to enable space for experimentation. We need

380
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:09,794
to enable to do mistakes and

381
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:12,982
to go the wrong way in order to find the right way.

382
00:26:13,116 --> 00:26:16,678
Okay. We don't just simply land on the right way.

383
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:20,038
We find it after spending time in the wrong ways.

384
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,690
Okay. We want to enable space for experimentation.

385
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:28,170
And we want people to know it's safe to experiment.

386
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,374
Super crucial. Finally, we want to empower

387
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:36,014
the champions. We want people to have a strong sense of

388
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,606
ownership about the things they're doing.

389
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:42,202
We want people to advance

390
00:26:42,266 --> 00:26:45,786
more initiatives. We want people to not just do what they're

391
00:26:45,818 --> 00:26:49,346
told, but also to feel part of

392
00:26:49,528 --> 00:26:52,980
the company, the solution. We want people

393
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,010
moving new ideas.

394
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,538
Great. So you have a growth culture.

395
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:05,026
But the second thing we want to ask, can you handle

396
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,546
the incident? Okay, so let's

397
00:27:08,578 --> 00:27:10,760
go back to our story from before.

398
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,766
The first thing you want to do is to identify the incident.

399
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:21,146
What does that mean? Remember earlier when you

400
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:24,806
were driving your car? Everything was great. Suddenly, you reach

401
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:28,446
to the office, three people looking at the same screen with

402
00:27:28,628 --> 00:27:33,082
sad faces. The first thing you want to do is to identify

403
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:37,042
what just happened. Let's say that this is your system,

404
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:40,340
okay? This is your algorithm, this is your whatever.

405
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,410
And you see that people are looking at one of the monitors with

406
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,220
long faces, and you understand something went wrong.

407
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,614
The first thing you want to do, activate the response team.

408
00:27:54,812 --> 00:27:58,760
You need to understand who are the best people

409
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,038
to address this type of issue. It could be from your team,

410
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:07,450
it could be from other teams. It could be collaborate, cooperation,

411
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,658
I don't know. But you want to activate the response team because this is

412
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:15,166
what you're doing right now. We have an issue in production. We need to

413
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:18,640
fix this now. Activate your response team.

414
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,454
Great, so you did that. But let's say that the

415
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:27,294
time it took for you, your bug is not only in this

416
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:30,510
component, but you also have it in other components,

417
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:34,578
okay? It's spreading and you don't know why or

418
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:38,594
where it's going to spread next. The next thing you want to do

419
00:28:38,632 --> 00:28:42,522
once you've activated your team, is containers.

420
00:28:42,686 --> 00:28:46,134
You want to make sure that this error, this mistake, does not

421
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,646
affect other teams, other services,

422
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,298
other protesters, okay?

423
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:56,534
Containment, it means shifting

424
00:28:56,582 --> 00:28:59,930
traffic to another service. It means using

425
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,702
a different data than you used to because this data is corrupted.

426
00:29:03,846 --> 00:29:07,646
I don't know every bug, its own solution. But the

427
00:29:07,668 --> 00:29:11,278
first thing you want to do is to contain the bug so you can control

428
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:14,640
it, okay? So it doesn't spread to your entire system.

429
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,994
Great. So if you've contained the problem and you have a team working

430
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:22,658
on a solution now, what you

431
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:26,580
want to do is to investigate the root cause. You want to understand

432
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,926
what happened that caused this issue. Why didn't you saw

433
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:35,398
it before? Okay? You want to

434
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:39,574
address the issue and figure out what's exactly

435
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:43,420
happening right now that is broken in your system

436
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,526
in order for you to fix it. So let's

437
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:51,100
say you did that and you saw this

438
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,322
small part in your data that is causing something,

439
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:58,298
that start a chain reaction,

440
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:01,920
that this is the outcome you're seeing

441
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,646
now that you have people working on the incidents and

442
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:08,978
you have contained the issue, now you can try

443
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:12,466
and to restore and recover. You can fix the

444
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:16,078
bug, make sure it works, make sure you can reproduce

445
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:19,206
the problem and your fix is actually fixing it.

446
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:22,694
And after all that is done,

447
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:27,000
you can now deploy and make your system smile again.

448
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,320
Okay? Make sure.

449
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,066
Okay, so this is basically the process. Now you

450
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:38,938
have to make sure throughout this entire process that you always

451
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:42,566
communicate with the stakeholders. If there's

452
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:45,846
an SLA issue, if something is broken,

453
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,838
if something is not doing what it's meant to do,

454
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:53,946
you want the people that could be affected from it, whether it's other teams

455
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:57,090
or your customers, to know about it, okay?

456
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,482
People are relying on the information you're given.

457
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:03,666
You want to give them the right information. You want them to

458
00:31:03,688 --> 00:31:07,140
act accordingly. Okay? Super important.

459
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:11,160
Especially while you're still handling the case,

460
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,594
okay? You don't want to wait for the case to be solved,

461
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:16,840
which sometimes can take even hours,

462
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,774
maybe even more, for people to know that

463
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:24,954
something happened, for people to suddenly see

464
00:31:24,992 --> 00:31:28,700
that the thing you're saying is not actually right or it's not correct,

465
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,362
and to lose their trust in you.

466
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:33,980
That's the worst thing.

467
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,534
That's the worst possible thing that can happen and you don't want to be

468
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:41,760
there. So communicate always.

469
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,102
So let's recap. We said

470
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:50,946
you first want to identify the incident. After that,

471
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:54,434
you want to activate your response team and have them start working on

472
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:58,226
it. The first thing they want to do is to

473
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:01,602
contain the incident. Make sure the incidents does not spread

474
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:05,446
to a different part of the system or different process that could

475
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:07,670
affect other teams and other logics.

476
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,990
After you have contained the incident and you know that

477
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,526
it's not going anywhere, now you can start and find the root

478
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:19,180
cause of the problem and try to solve it.

479
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,394
Once you do and you feel confident with your solution,

480
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:27,166
you can restore the system to its forking state

481
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:30,526
and recover from the bug. And finally,

482
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:34,846
always, throughout this entire process, communicate with

483
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:39,540
the stakeholders. Super important. Super important.

484
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,460
Sorry.

485
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:49,542
Okay, so we know

486
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:53,794
now that your team can a, absorb the incident,

487
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:57,826
right? And b, solve it. But there's

488
00:32:57,858 --> 00:33:00,882
something missing, right? I mean,

489
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:04,614
we had a bug, we handled

490
00:33:04,662 --> 00:33:07,980
it, right? But what's next?

491
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,426
Now, Churchill told us, never let

492
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,366
a good crisis go to waste. And this is exactly

493
00:33:16,468 --> 00:33:20,618
the part I'm talking about. We already have that incident.

494
00:33:20,714 --> 00:33:24,586
We already had that bug. Let's use it. We've learned

495
00:33:24,618 --> 00:33:28,510
something today, right? Let's use it. Let's rises.

496
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:34,114
Okay, so going back to our story, you came in the

497
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:37,650
morning, you saw the people in your teams looking at the monitor.

498
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,900
Long faces. Activate response team.

499
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,302
Great. You solved the bug. Everyone is happy. The first thing you do

500
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,926
is postmortem, right? You want to understand

501
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:54,090
what happened. You want to investigate how can this

502
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,274
not go not will happen. Sorry.

503
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:00,778
You want to make sure that this will not happen again, right?

504
00:34:00,944 --> 00:34:04,702
Great. Now, two major

505
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:08,346
important things I want to talk about postmortem and these are action

506
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:12,254
items and follow ups. Every postmortem should

507
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:15,486
have action items. I could not stress this enough.

508
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,474
If your postmortem does not have action items, you did not

509
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:23,298
did a postmortem. You simply wasted an hour of your team.

510
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:26,834
Okay? If you don't come up out of that

511
00:34:26,872 --> 00:34:30,706
postmortem with action items, you're simply saying, we had

512
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:34,262
an issue, we solved it. Let's just wait for the next

513
00:34:34,316 --> 00:34:37,926
issue. You need to have action items that will

514
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:41,160
make sure that next time, this will not happen to you.

515
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,466
Now, action items are great, but if

516
00:34:45,488 --> 00:34:48,842
you don't follow them, if you don't make sure that you actually

517
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:52,140
did them, they're useless. Okay,

518
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,654
let's say you came out of the post mortem, you wrote your

519
00:34:58,692 --> 00:35:01,998
action items. We need to fix this. You need to check that. We need

520
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:04,400
to make sure that this happens before that.

521
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,260
Great. But did you did it?

522
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:12,322
Is it actually done? So what I'm saying

523
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:15,810
is the minute you go out of the postmortem,

524
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,522
you want to schedule a new meeting for a week,

525
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:22,966
for two weeks, for a month, I don't know. But you want to schedule the

526
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:26,514
new meeting where you will follow up the action items

527
00:35:26,642 --> 00:35:30,578
and make sure what has been done and what hasn't.

528
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:34,598
Okay. If you dont do these two things, you don't

529
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:38,406
have any point in making postmortem simply

530
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,780
a waste of your hour. Okay,

531
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,174
great. So you did a postmortem, you did action

532
00:35:45,222 --> 00:35:50,974
items and you followed them. Great. But I

533
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:54,160
want to suggest a new idea. Like,

534
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,898
think about it. Instead of being

535
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,698
reactive to the incidents that just happened,

536
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:06,754
like something happened and you react to it,

537
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:10,806
let's become proactive. Let's try to

538
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:14,760
handle the incidents before they're happening and not after.

539
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,390
What do I mean? I mean, instead of

540
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,670
postmortem, let's do premortem.

541
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:26,186
Okay, bear with me. So basically

542
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:29,740
what just happened. You had an incidents, okay?

543
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,754
You fixed it. Great. And you post

544
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:37,790
mortem it, you understand why it happened. How did the fix work?

545
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,534
And now you're just waiting for the next incident, which will you

546
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:43,840
fix postmortem and so on.

547
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,730
But what if we reversed that cycle?

548
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,250
What if instead of waiting for the incidents,

549
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,202
we will do a premortem? We will understand

550
00:36:55,336 --> 00:36:58,726
what the next incident might be. Because we

551
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,878
know this area of our system is

552
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:05,574
a weak area. We know that this area of our

553
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:08,600
system is relatively new area.

554
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,366
I don't know. We know something. Instead of waiting

555
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,842
for the next incident to occur, fix it. And to

556
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:21,642
discuss about it, let's discuss about what

557
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:25,146
will happen. The stuff that we are afraid of,

558
00:37:25,248 --> 00:37:28,814
the stuff that we are not so comfortable about, we're not so

559
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:31,600
sure about. Let's understand why.

560
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,726
Let's make a plan of how we're going to fix that, how we're going

561
00:37:35,748 --> 00:37:39,060
to improve that, and let's upgrade our system.

562
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,706
Okay. Instead of waiting for the storm to

563
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:45,694
come to us, let us come to the storm,

564
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:49,782
but better prepared. By doing that, you can control

565
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:53,654
some of the variables of your equation and not just wait for

566
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:56,120
your equation to find you.

567
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,422
So, great. So we talked about this.

568
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:04,250
Let's talk about another thing. Increase your resiliency.

569
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,922
Think about it. Something happened. Usually something small

570
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:12,778
happened that caused the chain reaction. That made something big

571
00:38:12,864 --> 00:38:15,870
break, made something big corrupt.

572
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,586
If your system was more resilient.

573
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:24,302
Maybe the small thing still

574
00:38:24,356 --> 00:38:27,086
happened, but maybe the effect was not so big.

575
00:38:27,268 --> 00:38:30,110
Okay, if your system is resilient,

576
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,998
it can itself absorb some of the shocks,

577
00:38:34,174 --> 00:38:36,130
like we talked in the first chapter.

578
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,854
Now, what does it mean to make your system more

579
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:44,694
resilient? First of all, you can upgrade it.

580
00:38:44,812 --> 00:38:48,258
You can find the areas in your code that needs to be upgraded,

581
00:38:48,354 --> 00:38:51,786
that needs to be shaken up, that needs to

582
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:55,258
be improved. And do it. Do that before

583
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:58,986
something happens, not after. Don't wait for the

584
00:38:59,008 --> 00:39:03,506
lessons you learned from the incident. Try to discover. Try to explore

585
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:07,422
and to find the things in your system that

586
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:10,622
are broken. You just dont know it yet. Okay?

587
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:12,000
Upgrade those.

588
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,270
The next thing is to invest in your toolbox.

589
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,140
Sorry,

590
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:28,034
what does that mean? Do you

591
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:31,366
have enough documentation? Do you have

592
00:39:31,388 --> 00:39:34,482
enough tests? Do you have enough visibility?

593
00:39:34,626 --> 00:39:38,146
For when something breaks, you will be alerted

594
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:41,346
on okay, you don't want for the

595
00:39:41,388 --> 00:39:44,858
Customer calling for you, telling you there was a problem in your product,

596
00:39:44,944 --> 00:39:48,314
in your system. You want to know that

597
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:51,930
before it happens, in a different environment,

598
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:56,110
always better before it happens, and fix it

599
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,758
before it even actually gets to the customer. Okay?

600
00:39:59,924 --> 00:40:03,774
I mean, you do stuff all the time. You break and

601
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:07,406
repair stuff all the time, you improve stuff all the

602
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:10,850
time. Sometimes you don't know its effect until

603
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,114
it's too late. You don't want to be there, you don't want to be

604
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:17,842
that spot. You want to understand the actual

605
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:21,606
effect of the change you're doing now before it

606
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:25,878
reaches the customer and address

607
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:29,240
it before it's too late. Okay?

608
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,694
You want to have playbooks. You dont

609
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:38,406
want that when something breaks, the people to start scratching

610
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:42,906
their heads and don't know what to do. You want to write a

611
00:40:42,928 --> 00:40:46,362
fixed protocol of what to do if something happens.

612
00:40:46,496 --> 00:40:49,886
Who are the people that needs to be alerted? What should

613
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:53,102
be checked, what should be backed up, what should be?

614
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:56,686
I dont know. I don't know about your system, but you want for

615
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:01,038
the people, for your response team to have the right tools, the right playbooks,

616
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:04,658
for them to solve the incident. You want to make sure

617
00:41:04,824 --> 00:41:08,580
that while in an incident, which is a stressful situation,

618
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,910
they fought about everything they need to think about.

619
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,638
They touched all the points, they covered everything.

620
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:20,326
You don't want them to miss something because they

621
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:23,722
were stressed about it, okay? Because they didn't think about it.

622
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:27,466
And now you have a new bug somewhere else and it will take you

623
00:41:27,488 --> 00:41:30,650
some time to reach for it. Write playbooks.

624
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,754
Also invest in your transparency

625
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:40,510
and discoverability.

626
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:43,962
You want for something when something breaks,

627
00:41:44,026 --> 00:41:48,286
when something acts not the way it should be for a

628
00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:52,178
notification to pop up, for a dashboard to go red,

629
00:41:52,264 --> 00:41:55,220
for something to happen. Okay.

630
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:59,750
You want to be as visible as possible so that people,

631
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,320
yourself included, will understand as quickly as possible

632
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,920
what happened, what kind of effect it did,

633
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,162
what we need to do for the containment of this

634
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:16,506
incident. Okay? The better transparency you have,

635
00:42:16,528 --> 00:42:19,914
the better visibility you have, the sooner you will be able

636
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:21,260
to answer these questions.

637
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,510
Finally, you want to share your knowledge.

638
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,526
Okay. You've been in the trenches. You've suffered an

639
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,574
incident. You fixed it. You came up with a new solution that

640
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:38,318
can fix the problem you didn't think about before. I don't

641
00:42:38,334 --> 00:42:42,002
know. Tell people about it. People want to know.

642
00:42:42,056 --> 00:42:45,554
People want to learn from your mistakes. Go learn from other

643
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:49,240
people mistakes. You want to share your knowledge about

644
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,266
how people, your people handle

645
00:42:53,298 --> 00:42:57,094
this incidents in order to make everyone better, in order

646
00:42:57,132 --> 00:43:00,846
to make everyone smarter. Okay? Share your knowledge.

647
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:04,970
Share the stuff you've learned. Make other people rise from your incidents.

648
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,778
So let's recap. We said

649
00:43:10,864 --> 00:43:14,442
we want to do a post mortem. We want to investigate what

650
00:43:14,496 --> 00:43:17,180
caused this incident and how we can fix this.

651
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,774
We want to do a pre mortem. We want to imagine what could

652
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:25,854
go wrong, what could break. We want to fix this before it

653
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:30,190
breaks. We want to test this new behavior before it reaches

654
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,710
something critical. Okay? Do a premortem,

655
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,860
even though nothing is currently broken, as you know of.

656
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,966
You want to increase your resiliency. You want your system to

657
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:46,678
be stronger. You don't want any tiny bug to

658
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:50,194
disrupt your system entirely. You want the containment

659
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:54,250
of it to be full. You want your system resilient.

660
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,386
You want to share your knowledge. You want people to learn from

661
00:43:59,408 --> 00:44:02,758
your mistakes. You want to learn from other mistakes.

662
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:06,766
Again, you don't want everyone to fall in

663
00:44:06,788 --> 00:44:10,462
the same pit for them to know how to avoid it.

664
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:14,800
Okay? If you step on something, tell people

665
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,020
how to avoid it for them to not step on it as well.

666
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,042
So we now have a teams that

667
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:27,890
can absolve the incident,

668
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,854
solves the incident and benefits from

669
00:44:32,892 --> 00:44:36,566
the incident. Okay. If you

670
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:40,898
have a teams that's doing all these three things, your team is

671
00:44:41,004 --> 00:44:43,798
no longer afraid of bugs,

672
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:48,426
is no longer afraid of incidents, your team a

673
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:51,914
bit, wait for it. I know it's weird, but it

674
00:44:51,952 --> 00:44:55,086
recognize there's a chance of growth in

675
00:44:55,108 --> 00:44:58,814
these areas, in these

676
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:02,654
things that we all know that will occur one day or another.

677
00:45:02,852 --> 00:45:06,622
Again, think about what we said earlier. We dont know

678
00:45:06,676 --> 00:45:10,398
when, we don't know where, we don't know what it will affect,

679
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:14,660
but we know the storm is coming. Okay? Use it.

680
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,482
Use it as your tool. Don't be afraid of it.

681
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:22,020
Look for it. Okay? Evolve from it.

682
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,674
And finally. Sorry. I want to finish

683
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:30,822
a few words. When the winds of change blow,

684
00:45:31,006 --> 00:45:34,970
build walls while other build windmills.

685
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,180
Think about it. Harness the wind at your power.

686
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,560
Thank you.
