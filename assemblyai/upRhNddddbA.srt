00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,854
Hi everybody, thanks for being here. It is an honor to have a new

2
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:38,374
opportunity for sharing my last work avoiding the death of

3
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:41,814
SRE documents that matter. Nice to meet

4
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:45,666
you. I am Yury Nino. I am colombian. I work as cloud infrastructure

5
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:49,074
engineer at Google Cloud. Also I am chaos Engineering

6
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:53,114
and Cyrelia IT engineering advocate. You can find me LinkedIn,

7
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:56,622
Twitter and medium as jolinita. Regarding this

8
00:00:56,676 --> 00:01:00,094
talk, I have to say that this material is the result of a lot of

9
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:03,706
reading and self learning trying to build a framework for documenting

10
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:07,094
my exercises in chaos engineering.

11
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:10,222
In this path, I found an excellent article

12
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,730
titled why SRE documents Matter? Written by

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,274
Nukala and Bibecro who are SRE product managers

14
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:21,478
in Google. I'm going to start with this.

15
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:25,286
After that, I am going to describe a non extensive list of

16
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:29,294
SRE documents which were completed using the book seeking

17
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:33,350
SRE. With this in mind, I am going to share some recommendations

18
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,510
that I have learned while I was studying about this exciting topic.

19
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,166
Since you know what about sres just to share this

20
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,066
site reliability engineering is a job function, a mindset

21
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:48,462
and a set of engineering approaches for making web

22
00:01:48,516 --> 00:01:52,694
products and service run reliable. SRE operates

23
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:56,754
an intersection of software development and system engineering to

24
00:01:56,792 --> 00:02:00,798
solve operational problems and engineer solutions to villan

25
00:02:00,974 --> 00:02:04,786
larger scale distributed systems. SRE is

26
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:08,470
focused on the lifecycle of services from

27
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,874
inception and design, road development, operation,

28
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:17,458
refinement and eventual decommissioning.

29
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:20,726
In these phases, SI provides principles

30
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:24,042
and practices for monitoring and metrics. It is about

31
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:28,582
measuring how the service is actually behaving and correcting discrepancies,

32
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:31,500
emergency response in another words,

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,806
noticing and responding to service payloads in order to

34
00:02:35,828 --> 00:02:39,082
preserve their availability. According to slas,

35
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,682
capacity planning is very important here. That means

36
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:46,690
projecting future demand and ensuring that a service has enough

37
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,510
computing resource in appropriate locations

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,042
to satisfy that demand service turn

39
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:58,834
up and turn down deploying and removing computing resources

40
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:02,118
for a service in a data center in a data center

41
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:05,686
in a predictable fashion, often as a consequence of

42
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,606
capacity planning, change management about creating

43
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:13,126
the behavior of a service while preserving service reliability

44
00:03:13,238 --> 00:03:16,774
and performance regarding design, development and engineering

45
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:21,050
related to scalability, isolation, latency, dropout and efficient.

46
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,754
Regarding the commentation, I would like to share that according

47
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:29,546
this stack overflow 2022 developer survey,

48
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,154
the most important resource for people to know how to code is

49
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:37,246
technical documentation. However, the same participants rank

50
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:41,198
documentation as the number two challenge facing

51
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:45,358
developers. This is a problem because missing incomplete

52
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:49,490
or out documentation hurts

53
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:53,654
development, velocity, software quality and something that

54
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,786
is critical for SRE service reliability.

55
00:03:56,978 --> 00:04:01,510
So let me join this idea with the reason for documenting SRE processes.

56
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,414
The teams used to preserve the important operational concepts

57
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:08,714
and principles as nuggets of trivial knowledge that

58
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:12,426
are passed on verbally to new team members. And it

59
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,882
is a fact that if the concepts and principles are not

60
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,454
qualifying and documented, they need often

61
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:22,730
needed to be relearned painfully

62
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,458
through trial and error. In this sense,

63
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:28,478
documents are very important for many reasons.

64
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:31,858
They help developers communicate with each other and

65
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:35,258
they allow to future developers understand and maintain

66
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:38,930
the code. In general, good documents

67
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,658
helps you learn from your mistakes.

68
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:47,138
Sres often spend 35% on their time on operational

69
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:52,698
work, which leaves only 65%

70
00:04:52,784 --> 00:04:56,234
for development. This last person includes time for

71
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:59,802
documenting of course. However, documentation takes

72
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:03,082
time and effort and there is a specialist challenges

73
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:07,130
for SIS. It can be a major cause of frustration

74
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,666
and job unhappiness for developers.

75
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,462
Some developers consider that documenting

76
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:18,302
might not be recognized or rewarded during performance

77
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:21,970
review or promotion process. Having mentioned the

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,974
importance and the challenge of documentation, let me

79
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:29,826
focus on the type of SRE documents according

80
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:33,254
to the article why SRE documents matter? Remember this

81
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,406
presentation is based on this article. They can be

82
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:39,946
classified in these categories. Documents for running a

83
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:44,106
service, documents for new service onboarding documents for reporting services

84
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:48,950
take documents for production products, documents for service decommissioning,

85
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,094
and documents for running SRE teams. So let

86
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:56,746
me explore the documents in each category in the next slide.

87
00:05:56,938 --> 00:06:01,086
Documents for new service onboarding these documents the

88
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,714
documents in this category belong to a more general concept.

89
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:08,482
I am talking about PRA, a production readiness review.

90
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:12,254
A PR ER is conducted to make sure that a service meets

91
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:16,426
accepted standards of operational readiness and they owners

92
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,054
have a necessary guidance about running them. So let

93
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:24,214
me go throw in the specific documents for production ready review and

94
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:27,974
the first one is actually a dagger, the architecture and

95
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,414
dependencies which provide answers for why your

96
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:35,210
request flow from user to front end to backend. And there is

97
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,810
different types of requests with different latency requirements.

98
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,470
Review now the capacity planning it is a document with

99
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,262
answers for these questions. How much traffic and

100
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:50,762
rate of ground do you expect during and after the launch?

101
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:54,402
And have you obtained all the compute resources needed

102
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:58,434
to support your traffic? Another important document here

103
00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:01,874
is failure modes which provides answers for do you have

104
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:05,794
any single points of failure in your design? How do you mitigate

105
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,506
on availability of your dependencies about processes

106
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:13,570
and automation? These SRE the questions are any manual processes

107
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,822
required to keep the service running and how are

108
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:20,314
we automating these processes? Finally, in this

109
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:24,054
subcategory of documents for new service onboarding,

110
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:28,886
remember we were talking about production readiness review documents.

111
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:32,746
The main objectives with this documents is answering these questions

112
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:36,654
what terrify code, data, services or

113
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:40,110
events do the service or the launch depend upon?

114
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,834
Do any partners depend on your service? If so,

115
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:48,130
do they need to be notified of your release?

116
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,606
In addition to peer ers in this first category,

117
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:56,710
this first category includes documents for onboarding service.

118
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,514
The SRE organization needs to create overview documents

119
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:04,246
that explain the SRE role and responsibilities in general. Teams to

120
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:07,826
product development teams. This services to set the

121
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:11,574
expectations correctly. A primary goal of this document

122
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:15,478
is to ensure that developer teams don't equals sres

123
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:18,758
with an operations team. When developers don't

124
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:21,806
fully understand what sres do,

125
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:25,120
miscommunication and misunderstanding can result.

126
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,258
Another important documents here is the engagement model document

127
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:33,086
that explain how the SRE team which engage with developer

128
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:35,454
teams during and after service takeover.

129
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:39,538
Topics covered with this documents includes service

130
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:43,342
takeover criteria and peer process, sloan negotiation

131
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:46,654
process and error budget, new release criteria

132
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:50,514
and release policies, content and frequency

133
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:53,142
of services status report from SRE team,

134
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:56,722
SRE staffing requirements and future roadmap

135
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,314
planning processes. If you remember, sres need

136
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:04,646
to be effective across two domains, two domains development

137
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:08,678
and operations, so they need documents to understand enrolled

138
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:12,314
service and production. Example of the core documents

139
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:15,786
include service overviews, playbooks and procedures,

140
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:19,486
postmortems policies, and SLA. So let

141
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:23,090
me review each one. SRE needs to know the system

142
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,306
architecture, components, SRE dependencies and

143
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:30,306
service contacts and owners. These overviews SRE often

144
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:34,050
an output of peer process and they should be updated

145
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,610
as service change. For example, if you include a new dependency

146
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,470
in the service, a complete service overview provides a wall

147
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,114
description of the service and how it interacts with the core

148
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:49,778
around it, as well as links to dashboards,

149
00:09:49,874 --> 00:09:53,954
metrics, and related information that the service needs to solve unexpected

150
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:57,754
issues. Also cultroom books I love this type

151
00:09:57,792 --> 00:10:01,722
of documents. I am talking about playbooks. The on call engineers

152
00:10:01,786 --> 00:10:05,834
respond the alerts generated by service monitoring playbooks

153
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:09,530
reduce the time to mitigate an incident and they provide useful

154
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,294
links to consults and processes. Playbooks can contain

155
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:17,790
instructions for verification, troubleshooting, and escalation

156
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,854
for each alert generated from network monitoring processes

157
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:25,630
that contain commands and steps to review for accuracy.

158
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,834
It is a classical as you know, remember a software

159
00:10:28,882 --> 00:10:32,470
postmortem. It is can analysis conducted after a system

160
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,246
failure. Each post mortem derived from this template describes a

161
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,734
production outdash timeline, description of user impact,

162
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:43,990
group calls, action teams, and lesson learn technical policies.

163
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,754
In this slide I am going to talk about policies and the first one

164
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:51,854
is technical policies. Technical policies can apply to areas such as

165
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,438
production change, login, log retention, and internal service

166
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,762
name. Policies also apply to processes,

167
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,990
escalation policies, health engineers classified production issues

168
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,970
and emergencies or no emergencies and provide recommendations

169
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,422
on the appropriate action for each category.

170
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:15,422
Can on call expectation policies outline the structure

171
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:18,360
of the teams and responsibilities of the team members.

172
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:22,674
An SLA is a formal agreement with a customer on the performance

173
00:11:22,722 --> 00:11:26,518
of a service. SRE teams document their services for

174
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:30,470
availability, latency, and monitor performance

175
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,502
nodes. Having SLAS allows SRE

176
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:38,506
teams to innovate more quickly while preserving a good

177
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:42,234
user experience. SRE's running services will

178
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:45,486
well defining slas will detect outage faster and

179
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:49,390
therefore resolve them faster. Good slas also

180
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,174
resoning less friction between and

181
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:57,758
software engineers that is classical in

182
00:11:57,764 --> 00:12:01,602
the next slides, I am going to describe documents that are related to the

183
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:05,330
products and tools SREs documents developed.

184
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,034
These documents are important because they enable users

185
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:13,890
to find out whether a product is right for them or to adapt

186
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,914
how to get started and how to get support. They also provide a

187
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:21,814
consistent user experience and facilitate production adoption.

188
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:25,734
This helps SRES product development engineers

189
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:28,874
to understand what the product or tool is and

190
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:32,720
what it does and whether they should use it.

191
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,682
In the next slides I am going to describe documents that are related

192
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:42,342
to the products and tools SRE developed. These documents

193
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:46,660
important because they enable users to find out whether a product

194
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,634
to adopt. Let me start with this

195
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:55,262
guide, a concept guide or glossary which define

196
00:12:55,326 --> 00:12:59,062
all the terms unique to the product. Our goal of a quick start

197
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:02,422
guide is to get engineers up and

198
00:13:02,476 --> 00:13:06,130
running with a minimum of delay. It is helpful

199
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,106
to new users who want to give a product a try.

200
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:13,754
How to guide this type of document is for users who

201
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,766
need to know how to accomplish a specific goal

202
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:21,002
with the product, how to help users complete

203
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:24,374
important specific tasks and they are general procedure

204
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:27,946
based. Finally, engineers use development guides that

205
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:31,630
is really important here to find out how to program

206
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,814
to a product. APIs engineers can use

207
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:38,562
code labs or tutorials you can find in Google

208
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:42,642
for example as tutorials combining explanation example code

209
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,546
and could exercise to get up to speed with the

210
00:13:46,568 --> 00:13:50,574
product. Could labs can also provide in depth scenarios

211
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,294
to wall engineers step by step draw

212
00:13:54,412 --> 00:13:58,520
a series of key tasks. I really like this. The fact

213
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,470
page answers common questions. Also, the common

214
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,346
answers dispoints users to reference documents and

215
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,546
other pages on the site for more information.

216
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:13,598
The support page which identify how engineers can get

217
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,990
help get when they are stuck on something.

218
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,002
It also includes an escalation flow, troubleshooting info

219
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:24,900
group links, dashboard and SLO and on call information.

220
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,930
An appearance is usually generated from

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,638
code comments and sometimes written by tech writers.

222
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:35,974
This provides description on functions, classes and

223
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:40,310
methods which minimal verbose or narrative.

224
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,034
This part describes the documents that SRE teams produce

225
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:47,286
to communicate the state of the services they

226
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:50,666
support. Information about the state of a

227
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:54,474
service comes in two forms, quarterly service review and

228
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:58,346
a presentation about this. The goal of the quarterly report

229
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:02,634
or presentation is to cover the state of the service review, including details

230
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:06,666
about performance, sustainability, risk, and overall

231
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:12,174
production health. SRE is

232
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:16,686
interested in highquality reports because they provide visibility

233
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:20,670
into the following uncle tickets

234
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,690
postmortems performance of SLA risk quarry

235
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,854
reports also provide opportunities for SRE team

236
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:32,818
to highlight the benefits of SRE prioritization

237
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:36,674
for solving problems and request feedback about the SRE

238
00:15:36,722 --> 00:15:40,170
team. Folks SRE teams need to have

239
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,490
a cohesive set of reliable, discoverable documentation to function

240
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,266
effectively as a team. So it is a good practice to create a

241
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:52,350
team site with a team chapter because it provides a focal point

242
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:56,138
for information and documents about the SRE teams and projects.

243
00:15:56,234 --> 00:16:00,138
At Google, for example, many SRE teams use Gitris docs,

244
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,922
that is an internal documentation platform where documentation and

245
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:07,550
source code lie. Specifically, team charters

246
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,934
explains their rationale for the teams and documents scoring major engagement

247
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:15,414
a charter service to establish the team

248
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:19,106
identity, primary goals, and role relative

249
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:23,126
to the rest of the organization. A shorter general includes the

250
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,946
following elements, a high level explanation of the space in which teams

251
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:31,066
team operates, a short description of the top two or three services

252
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:35,194
managed by the team, the key principles and service and

253
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:38,426
values for the team, and the links to the team. Sres and

254
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:42,160
documents SRE teams invest in training

255
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,998
materials and processes for new sres because training

256
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:49,258
results in a faster onboarding to production environment.

257
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:53,674
SRE's team also benefits from having new members acquire

258
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:57,202
the skills required to join the ranks of phone call

259
00:16:57,256 --> 00:17:00,430
as early as possible. In the absence of comprehensive

260
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,940
training the SRE school found

261
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:08,386
during a crisis or during a potential minor

262
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:12,134
incident to a major outbreak. Many SRE teams use

263
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:15,906
checklists for on call training and on call checklist generally covers

264
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:19,674
all high level areas. Team members should understand well.

265
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:23,414
Example of this include production concepts, front end and backend

266
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:26,410
start, automation and tools and monitoring.

267
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:30,946
Sres also use roleplay

268
00:17:30,998 --> 00:17:34,990
training. For example, in Google we use well of misfortune

269
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,194
which is an educational tool for training teams

270
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:42,874
members. In this exercise, a notage a scenario

271
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:46,306
is presented to the team with the data the team members taking

272
00:17:46,408 --> 00:17:49,842
of playing the role of the on call

273
00:17:49,896 --> 00:17:53,838
engineer in order to mitigate any emergency role

274
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:57,378
play exercise teams the ability of the

275
00:17:57,464 --> 00:18:01,398
SREs to know where to find the documents and to use

276
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:04,786
it for solving the hypothetical incident

277
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:08,714
let me finish with this presentation with some recommendations from

278
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:12,234
Google to keep live documents. The first

279
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:15,578
one is communicating the value of documents. That is very important.

280
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:19,894
That is my first recommendation. If you want to combine fellow

281
00:18:19,942 --> 00:18:23,594
engineers and leadership to invest time and resource in documents,

282
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:27,390
it is essential that you gather data that demonstrates the quality,

283
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,986
effectiveness and the value of your documentation.

284
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:35,058
Remember, when you talk about the impact of your documentation work you

285
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:38,130
sre talking about the business value for your output.

286
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,158
So while structured quality pretty easy to measure,

287
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,894
functional data is combining. Remember that it falls in three

288
00:18:45,932 --> 00:18:49,714
buckets. Measurable success, user behavior and sentiment

289
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,138
data. The second one is to create a centralized repository.

290
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:56,406
SI team information can be distributed across

291
00:18:56,508 --> 00:19:00,694
a number of sites, local team knowledge and Google Drive folders

292
00:19:00,742 --> 00:19:04,314
for example, which can make it difficult to find correct and

293
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,914
relevant information. So it is really important to define a

294
00:19:07,952 --> 00:19:11,566
structure for all information and ensure that the team members know where is

295
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:15,214
to start, find and maintain information that is the

296
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:18,990
most important. Here are some guidelines to create and manage

297
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,054
a team documents repository. Determine relevant stakeholders

298
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:26,322
and conduct brief interviews to identify all needs.

299
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:30,242
Locate as much documents as possible and do

300
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:34,146
a gap analysis on content. Set up a

301
00:19:34,168 --> 00:19:37,986
basic structure for the site and the new documents can be created

302
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:41,106
in the correct location. Create a monitoring

303
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:45,122
and reporting structure to track the progress of migration archive

304
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:49,002
of documentation that is very important. Verify which

305
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:52,470
common terms are used in search feature

306
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,726
for example and finally use signals such as Google Analytics

307
00:19:56,758 --> 00:20:01,106
to track analyze usage. After you determine

308
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,426
the functional requirements and quality indicators for each document,

309
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,078
it is really valuable to create templates. Templates make

310
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:11,774
easy for authors to create new documentation and providing the

311
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:15,506
clear structure that they can populate with relevant information.

312
00:20:15,688 --> 00:20:19,346
With a good template, creating a simple documents can be easy as

313
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:22,514
filling out forms. Templates make easy for

314
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,810
readers to quickly understand the topic of the document,

315
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,790
the type of information and how it is organized.

316
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,234
The site reliability engineering book contains several

317
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:37,310
of documentation templates. Here are an example of playbook

318
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,934
template that provides a structure and guidance for engineers

319
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:44,538
filling in the content. Another important

320
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:47,862
documents is defining success metrics.

321
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:51,082
It is essential if you want to able to communicate the value

322
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:54,430
of your work to the rest of your organization. For example,

323
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,382
a service review has a high functionality if it

324
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:01,898
provide necessary the context needed to handle in the outage

325
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,662
and if you have the possibility to measure

326
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:09,362
the impact in the organization. It is important

327
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:13,282
to have a guidance from technical writers because

328
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:16,694
they provide a lot of support that make SRE documents are

329
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:20,914
effective and productive. Here are some guidance to work with technical writers.

330
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:24,962
Technical writers should partner with sres to provide operational

331
00:21:25,026 --> 00:21:29,066
documents for running services and product documents for SRE products and

332
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,694
features. Writers should provide consulting

333
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:36,614
to assess assets, analysis, documentation and information management

334
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:40,354
needs. Writers should evaluate and improve

335
00:21:40,422 --> 00:21:44,570
documentation tools to provide the best solution for SIS.

336
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,518
That are my recommendation when you are working with

337
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:52,946
technical writers. Finally, required documents as part

338
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:56,030
of code review documentation is like testing.

339
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,002
Nobody really wants to do it, but if you can

340
00:22:00,056 --> 00:22:03,294
minimize this sentiment taking advantage

341
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:07,554
of code reviewers powers. Not all changes requires

342
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:11,602
documents updated of course, but here a good rule of thumb

343
00:22:11,746 --> 00:22:15,654
doing documents better. Best practice if a

344
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:19,382
developer, SRE or user of your project needs to change

345
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:23,362
their behavior after visa change, the changes should include

346
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:26,694
document change. That is the recommendation here.

347
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:30,414
Require this as part of code

348
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:34,206
review and that is all. Thank you so much. Thank you

349
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:38,430
so much for being here and thank you so much for listening

350
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,134
this presentation. I really hope that it will

351
00:22:43,172 --> 00:22:46,220
be useful for you. Thank you. Have a good day.
