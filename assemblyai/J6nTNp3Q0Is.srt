00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,694
Hello everyone, thanks for joining us. Today in

2
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:47,234
this rapidly evolving digital era, businesses are continuously

3
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:50,666
seeking ways to leverage modern technology g's

4
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:54,522
to enhance their efficiency, stay competitive

5
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:58,202
and accelerate their growth. A pivotal aspect

6
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:01,710
of this transformation is digital modernization.

7
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,482
Today, we embark on a journey into the realm of

8
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:10,050
digital modernization on public cloud platforms,

9
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,438
examining its three key facets,

10
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:17,878
application modernization, infrastructure modernisation and

11
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:22,002
data modernization. We'll also look into the strategic

12
00:01:22,066 --> 00:01:25,682
use of tools like terraform and Packer,

13
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:29,754
crafting a resilient platform that empowers us

14
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:33,980
to unlock the complete capabilities of the public cloud platform

15
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,490
through streamlined deployment and resource reapplication.

16
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,146
As we embark on our exploration for digital modernization

17
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:47,338
today, it is crucial to dispel the misconception

18
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:51,050
that it merely involves migrating applications

19
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,122
to the cloud. The landscape of modernization extends

20
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:59,410
beyond a simple relocation.

21
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,490
It encompasses a holistic transformation that

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,480
integrates three essential elements, application,

23
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,654
infrastructure and data. These three

24
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:15,910
facets synergize to form the comprehensive concept of

25
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,786
digital modernization. Now let's break it

26
00:02:19,808 --> 00:02:24,294
down a little further. Application modernisation involves

27
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:28,250
optimizing and enhancing existing applications,

28
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,830
making them cloud native, scalable and agile.

29
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,194
Simultaneously, infrastructure modernization focuses

30
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:40,746
on refining the underlying it infrastructure

31
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:44,850
to harness the full potential of cloud resources.

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,590
Finally, digital modernization addresses

33
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,914
the strategic management and utilization of data,

34
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:56,950
ensuring that it becomes a valuable asset for

35
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,278
informed decision making. Together,

36
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:04,130
these interconnected components redefine the digital

37
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,234
landscape, creating a symbiotic relationship

38
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:11,050
that goes beyond simple migration.

39
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,854
It is a transformative journey towards digital

40
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:18,922
modernisation. So remember in this

41
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:23,070
equation, the combined force of application modernisation,

42
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,498
infrastructure modernization and data modernization

43
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,230
provides the true essence of digital modernisation.

44
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,550
Now, there are many benefits of application modernisation

45
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,990
and some of these benefits include increased agility

46
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,718
and scalability. All the cloud based applications

47
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:47,014
are much more agile and scalable than traditional on

48
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:51,122
premises applications. This means that businesses

49
00:03:51,186 --> 00:03:54,902
can quickly adapt to changing customer demands and

50
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:58,514
market conditions. It also provides reduced

51
00:03:58,562 --> 00:04:02,506
costs. All the cloudbased applications can help businesses to

52
00:04:02,528 --> 00:04:06,390
reduce their it costs by eliminating the need to purchase

53
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,930
and maintain on premises hardware and software.

54
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,202
Improved security and compliance cloud platforms

55
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:18,126
offer a number of security and compliance features that can

56
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:22,030
help businesses to protect their data and applications.

57
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,414
Cloudbased applications can also provide a better user

58
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:30,366
experience than the traditional on premises applications.

59
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:34,794
This is primarily because they can be accessed from anywhere

60
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:39,190
on any device and they can be updated more frequently.

61
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,730
Cloudbased applications can also help businesses to innovate

62
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,358
more quickly by providing access to new technologies

63
00:04:47,474 --> 00:04:51,706
and development tools. Now, before we dive in,

64
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:55,130
let's clarify the concept of digital modernization.

65
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,578
I believe digital modernization is the process of

66
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:02,970
harnessing advanced technologies and platforms

67
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,942
to transform IT infrastructure, data management and

68
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:10,206
application development. In the context of

69
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,694
Google Cloud platform or any other cloud platform for that

70
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:17,410
matter, we'll break it down into true core categories.

71
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,302
Infrastructure modernization it is the foundation of digital

72
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:26,130
transformation. It is basically transitioning

73
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,530
from legacy on premises infrastructure

74
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,630
to agile, scalable and cloud based solutions.

75
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,706
Google Cloud platform also offers a wide array

76
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,470
of services and tools for modernizing infrastructure.

77
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,058
Then comes data modernization, which is

78
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:50,134
unlocking the value of data through cloud based storage and

79
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:54,106
processing capabilities, empowering advanced

80
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:57,902
analytics, real time insights and

81
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:01,934
intelligent decision making. Similar to

82
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:06,014
the infosec modernization, Google Cloud provides powerful

83
00:06:06,062 --> 00:06:09,554
solutions for data modernisation as well for

84
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:13,614
data warehousing, data lakes, analytics and machine

85
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:17,350
learning. Third in the list is application modernization,

86
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,858
which is basically the process of updating application architecture,

87
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:25,842
design and functionality to leverage new technologies

88
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:29,670
and cloud platforms, enhancing scalability,

89
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,380
agility and user experience of the application.

90
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,158
A transformative process that goes beyond simple migration

91
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:42,538
to the cloud infrastructure modernization forms

92
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:45,310
the bedrock of any digital modernisation.

93
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,026
It involves migrating from traditional on premises setups

94
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:52,758
to dynamic cloud based infrastructure.

95
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,350
It refers to the process of updating and migrating

96
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,620
an organization's IT infrastructure to the cloud.

97
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,078
This can involve moving servers, storage networking

98
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:07,874
to the cloud, as well as adopting cloud native technologies

99
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:11,750
such as containerization and serverless computing.

100
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,390
The key elements include virtualization and containerization

101
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,246
by utilizing tools like Kubernetes and compute

102
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:24,330
engine for scalability, profitability and efficiency.

103
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,110
Infrastructure as a code which is automating infrastructure provisioning

104
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,590
and management through code based tools like terraform

105
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,134
serverless computing which is leveraging platforms like cloud run

106
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:41,150
cloud functions for automatic scaling and cost

107
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,474
efficiency. Then we have network modernisation which

108
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:49,522
is Google

109
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:53,042
Cloud platform's high performance network infrastructure for

110
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:57,110
fast, secure and globally connected applications.

111
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,806
From a data modernization perspective, data is a

112
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:06,994
very valuable asset and modernizing data management unlocks

113
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:10,422
its full potential. Data modernization

114
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:13,974
refers to the process of updating and migrating

115
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:18,042
an organization's data into the cloud. This can

116
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,534
involve moving data from on premises data centers to

117
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:25,006
cloudbased data lakes and warehouses, as well

118
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:29,306
as adopting cloudbased data processing and analytics tools.

119
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:33,206
Some of the key concepts include data warehousing

120
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:36,834
which is migrating to solutions like bigquery for

121
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:40,660
handling large volumes of structured and semi structured data,

122
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,558
data lakes and analytics where storing,

123
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:48,070
managing and analyzing diverse data types using

124
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,430
cloud storage, dataflow and dataproc.

125
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,734
Then we have data streaming and real time analytics which

126
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:59,610
is ingesting, processing and analyzing data

127
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,730
in real time using tools like cloud, pubsub,

128
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,634
machine learning and AI. Harnessing AI services like

129
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:10,434
Automl AI platform and Tensorflow

130
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:12,750
for innovation and efficiency.

131
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,990
Lastly, application modernisation. It is all

132
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,526
about more than just migrating to the cloud,

133
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:25,010
it is about enhancing applications architecture and functionality.

134
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,998
Some of the key concepts included in application modernization

135
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:33,570
process are breaking the application into

136
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,878
microservices architecture. As I mentioned,

137
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,942
it is basically the process of breaking monolithic applications into

138
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:44,178
microservices for agility,

139
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:47,430
scalability and independent deployment.

140
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,534
API based integration which is fostering interoperability

141
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:55,910
through seamless integration with other applications

142
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,382
and systems. DevOps and CI CD

143
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:02,770
which is embracing DevOps practices and CI

144
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,546
CD pipelines for automated builds,

145
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:09,534
testing and deployment employ something like

146
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:13,486
domain driven design. If the core businesses are aligned

147
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:16,754
with specific domains, decouple the

148
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,140
applications from any specific technology.

149
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,578
Isolate business logic from technology stack now

150
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:27,526
whenever we talk about migration to the cloud,

151
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:31,446
we have heard of the R's. Depending on the

152
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:34,790
vendor it can be 5 hours, 6 hours

153
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,154
or 7 hours, but on a very high level the

154
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:41,306
R's. Here are the process

155
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:45,114
or the methodology that we are using to move the

156
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:48,602
application to the cloud. So first one

157
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:51,854
in the list is retire. This is basically the

158
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:55,246
process of where after application

159
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:59,274
discovery you can decide that you don't need these applications

160
00:10:59,322 --> 00:11:02,800
in the future, so you are just going to retire them.

161
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,594
This is just getting rid of them as you are not going to use them

162
00:11:08,632 --> 00:11:12,478
anymore in future. Second one is retain.

163
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:16,422
You can decide to keep applications exactly as is before

164
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,910
a reevaluation sometime in future is required.

165
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,326
An example of this application migration strategy could

166
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:28,630
be unsupported authentic system and applications

167
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,502
legacy applications that do not have a business justification

168
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:37,254
for migrating to the cloud. The next one is rehost.

169
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:41,270
One of the most basic ways of migrating to the cloud is simply

170
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,734
to rehost something and this is sometimes also called as

171
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:48,458
lift and shift. This means to take your applications

172
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:52,362
or systems and move them exactly as is into the cloud

173
00:11:52,436 --> 00:11:56,142
environment. This approach is great for organizations

174
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:59,714
that need to migrate quickly. For example, the data

175
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,026
center lease is coming to end soon. For the

176
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:06,694
majority of applications, this type of strategy is

177
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:10,546
also the first step because it's easier to optimize

178
00:12:10,658 --> 00:12:13,846
or rearchitect them once they are already running in the

179
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:17,270
cloud. An example of

180
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,386
this kind of strategy could be a VM currently running in your

181
00:12:21,488 --> 00:12:24,986
local ESX cluster which is copied to

182
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:27,738
a vsphere instance running on cloud,

183
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:30,830
something like GCP VM instance.

184
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,826
Some of the pros of this approach is speed

185
00:12:34,858 --> 00:12:38,094
of migration. Reduced risk of

186
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:42,710
migration could be automated or assisted by cloud native tools.

187
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,754
Then we have real platform which is sometimes called

188
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:50,158
as lift and reshape because you can potentially

189
00:12:50,254 --> 00:12:53,662
take advantage of some of the spatial capabilities

190
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:57,606
of the cloud. An example of this app migration strategy would

191
00:12:57,628 --> 00:13:01,698
be replatforming leads to cloud optimization

192
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:05,766
due to some cloud platform adoption while

193
00:13:05,948 --> 00:13:08,940
keeping the application core architecture the same.

194
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,110
Often, replatforming is used when replacing

195
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,126
database backends of application with a corresponding

196
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:20,490
pass database solution of a cloud provider.

197
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,990
The next strategy in the list is repurchase.

198
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,734
Repurchasing, also called as replacing, is the

199
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:32,714
strategy where the legacy application is fully replaced

200
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:36,178
by a SaaS solution that provides the same or similar

201
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,774
capabilities. This involves abandoning

202
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:43,026
the existing software that you have and migrating to

203
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:46,358
a cloud first application. An example

204
00:13:46,444 --> 00:13:49,750
could be changing your web application firewall to

205
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,114
something like cloud armor web application firewall with managed

206
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:57,442
rules, or swapping a self run email

207
00:13:57,516 --> 00:14:02,250
system for an online email as a service offering.

208
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,490
The last one in the list is rearchitect or refactor

209
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,510
for highly critical applications that require cloud

210
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,902
native characteristics or applications that need

211
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:18,560
thorough modernization due to outdated NAS or performance issues.

212
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,166
Rearchitecting, also called as refactoring or rebuild,

213
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,342
is the strategy that usually leads to the highest transformation

214
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:31,186
cost. However, it allows optimized use of

215
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,622
cloud, leading to cloud native benefits and making the application future

216
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:39,254
proofite. Rearchitecting an

217
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:43,046
application often comes along with the opportunity to

218
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:46,898
even break down the supported business processes into fragments,

219
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:50,906
which greatly improves simplicity and makes a business process

220
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:55,066
more agile. This is the most advanced application

221
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:58,774
migration strategy. Put simply, it is a redesign

222
00:14:58,822 --> 00:15:02,350
of your application in a more cloud native manner.

223
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,474
In general, you create a serverless version of legacy

224
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:09,726
application. An example of this approach could

225
00:15:09,748 --> 00:15:13,230
be migration of your on premises

226
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,766
oracle database to something like cloud spanner.

227
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,274
You can choose to modernize your monolithic application

228
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:25,542
by breaking it down into smaller microservices and

229
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:28,840
leverage services like cloud run or cloud function.

230
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,282
Some of the benefits are highly increased

231
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:36,280
efficiency, agility and improved cost,

232
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,966
eliminating dependency on custom hardware or proprietary

233
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:44,614
technology platforms and no infrastructure

234
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:48,074
or service to maintain. Just a call out

235
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:51,802
here that it's the last approach which is refactor

236
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:55,594
or rearchitecting which is basically the application modernization

237
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:59,360
that we are going to be focusing on now.

238
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,762
Just to reemphasize application modernisation is

239
00:16:03,816 --> 00:16:07,374
the process of updating and refactoring existing

240
00:16:07,422 --> 00:16:11,362
applications to take advantage of new technologies and

241
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,734
cloud computing platforms. This can involve

242
00:16:14,782 --> 00:16:18,702
a variety of changes such as migrating applications

243
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:22,310
to the cloud native services, refactoring them

244
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,746
to a microservice architecture, or adding

245
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:29,622
a new feature such as mobile support or artificial

246
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:32,986
intelligence. To summarize, everything that we

247
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:36,090
have discussed the three facets of modernization.

248
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,042
Google Cloud platform, along with Hashicoff product

249
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:43,934
suite, offers a wide range of services and tools that

250
00:16:43,972 --> 00:16:47,040
can help businesses to modernize their application.

251
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,454
An example of such an architecture or such a

252
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:55,202
solution could be something that's shown on this

253
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:59,022
page here. I'm not saying this is the only solution,

254
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:02,722
but a combination of different services that are

255
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:06,998
displayed here could be used to achieve a complete

256
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,320
digital transformation for our business.

257
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,920
So on the very far left,

258
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,310
top side, we have externally facing applications

259
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,250
configured with cloud load balancing and cloud armor.

260
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,742
Tools like APG API platform or cloud endpoints

261
00:17:26,886 --> 00:17:30,162
are used for interfacing with applications

262
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:33,950
via custom developed API endpoints.

263
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,882
Then we have native tools like cloud build in conjunction

264
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:41,566
with third party tools such as terraform and Packer that

265
00:17:41,588 --> 00:17:44,100
are used to define infrastructure as a code.

266
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,014
Application secrets can be stored

267
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:52,050
securely in secrets manager or hashicoff vault

268
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,534
data encryption address is provided to

269
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:59,858
multiple services via key management system or KMS,

270
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,702
in short, container image deployment using

271
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:07,994
artifact registry and securing that with

272
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:11,450
signature validation via binary authorization,

273
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,926
which is basically the process of only deploying the images

274
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:18,970
from verified sources.

275
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,282
Then we have application compute components replatformed

276
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:28,122
and are rearchitected into containerized

277
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:32,518
platforms, things like cloud run or GKE

278
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:35,650
or even cloud functions.

279
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,370
Then we have on the right hand side, in the middle

280
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,242
of this whole tier data where

281
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:47,990
we host data on cloud native services such as cloud

282
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,862
storage, cloud SQL firestore or

283
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,890
memory store event driven interaction

284
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,018
using services like pub sub or event arc.

285
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:04,150
Then at the very far right, we have cloud

286
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,618
operation suites utilized for application observability and

287
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:13,050
then we have tools like Bigquery and Google Data Studio

288
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,534
for analytics purposes. So as we can see

289
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:21,278
the whole spectrum from left to right, there are a number of services

290
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:26,030
that we can use to optimize the infrastructure,

291
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,254
application and data to provide the complete digital modernization

292
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:34,846
to any business. Now, to distinguish between application

293
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:37,510
modernization and cloud migration,

294
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,874
I'll put together some of the key focus areas

295
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:45,522
here. While these two are closely

296
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:48,762
related, application modernization and cloud

297
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:52,330
migration have distinct focuses and scopes.

298
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,246
So from a focus perspective, application modernization

299
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,650
enhances application architecture,

300
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,034
whereas cloud migration primarily involves

301
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:07,386
shifting to the cloud, moving your application from on premises

302
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,762
to the cloud. From a scope perspective,

303
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:14,606
application modernization encompasses infrastructure,

304
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,962
data and application architecture, whereas cloud

305
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:22,542
migration centers on application and infrastructure

306
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:25,750
transition from a compelling moment

307
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,302
or trigger point perspective. More often

308
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:33,750
than not, application modernization is

309
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,102
considered when there are issues with the application performance

310
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:42,022
or when you want to include new capabilities and the functionalities,

311
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:46,374
how the application is run or behaving.

312
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:50,086
Whereas for cloud migration it is primarily when the

313
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:53,486
data center leave is coming to an end and we need to

314
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:57,200
move our application off to another

315
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,562
set of servers or we need to renew the lease.

316
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:05,570
So that's when the cloud migration is primarily considered.

317
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,126
From benefits perspective, application modernization fully

318
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:12,930
leverages cloud technology's potential,

319
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,966
whereas cloud migration primarily taps into

320
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:20,194
the scalability and flexibility that is provided

321
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:23,206
by the public cloud platform. Now,

322
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:27,080
in the quest to harness the power of cloud technology,

323
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,446
application modernisation is a pivotal strategy.

324
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:34,170
By understanding infrastructure modernization,

325
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,602
data modernization and application modernisation as

326
00:21:38,656 --> 00:21:42,074
interconnected components, businesses can embark

327
00:21:42,122 --> 00:21:46,010
on a comprehensive journey to transform their applications

328
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,766
and fully embrace the potential of the public cloud application

329
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:55,322
modernisation, infrastructure modernization and data modernization

330
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:59,450
are all essential components of a comprehensive digital

331
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,922
transformation strategy. By modernisation,

332
00:22:02,986 --> 00:22:06,182
all these true components organizations can

333
00:22:06,236 --> 00:22:10,466
improve their agility, scalability and efficiency

334
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:14,530
to gain a competitive advantage in this digital

335
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,942
economy. Remember, it's not just

336
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:21,762
about moving to the cloud, it's about optimizing

337
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:26,150
applications for success in the modern digital landscape.

338
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,570
Thank you for your attention.
