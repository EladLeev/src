00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,674
Hello everyone, this is Trista. I'm the Sophie X co founder

2
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:34,546
and the CTO. So actually I really experienced

3
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:38,342
the precise from the open source part to the

4
00:00:38,396 --> 00:00:41,654
open source commercial part. And then now

5
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:44,838
we have our open source commercial company,

6
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:48,678
Sophie Ex. But today I will just focus on

7
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:52,590
how to foster or develop your community,

8
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,142
especially the tech open source community. Make it

9
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:59,770
become active or healthy.

10
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,470
So maybe one day that you found you really

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,442
like your community and your community become broader and

12
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:11,106
active and also maybe for the next step for

13
00:01:11,128 --> 00:01:14,878
your commercial company or monetization.

14
00:01:15,054 --> 00:01:18,660
Right? So that's the background of myself.

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,274
Like I said, I'm the Sophia has co founder and CTO.

16
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:26,530
Actually I started my commercial journey

17
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,074
from the developer. Because I'm a developer, I really

18
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:33,402
put my lot of time in the tech area and

19
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:37,462
open source areas, especially about the approaches

20
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:41,630
software foundation there. Actually I

21
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,600
joined there and learn what's the open source and

22
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,218
how CTO make your open source become so active

23
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:54,206
and to know the rules of the rani

24
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:57,918
or open source community. Therefore Apache,

25
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:01,742
Shirley and Sophia become the top leopard jet of Approaches

26
00:02:01,806 --> 00:02:05,910
foundation. And also I become the

27
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,638
incubator approaches incubator mentor to

28
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:12,914
provide more help to other open source

29
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:17,222
tech community. All right, so actually if

30
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:20,934
you interested in me or my post or articles, you can

31
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:24,314
give a look on my twitter or linking and see you

32
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,722
there, right? So today, that's the

33
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:32,250
structure of today's talk. First we need to give the definition

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,318
what's the health and active open source tech

35
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:39,674
community? And then we have the definition,

36
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:43,630
we want to make our community become that.

37
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,266
Then we need to take some actions, right? Then we

38
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:50,674
need to have some the actions, the steps to reach that

39
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,786
goal. Therefore, you can see were we will talk

40
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:58,434
each of the atoms how to reach the death goal,

41
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:01,986
how to make your community become that liable,

42
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,814
right? So how do you understand what's the open source tech

43
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,446
community? Actually, when people give the evaluation,

44
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,730
different people from different perspectives have

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,586
different idea about it. In general,

46
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:20,178
if we want to evaluate open source

47
00:03:20,214 --> 00:03:23,338
community, we have the following metrics.

48
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:26,960
First, about the project or coding quality.

49
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,430
Second, it's license and copyright.

50
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,686
And also about a document about the articles.

51
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,306
And also does this project provide a

52
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:41,982
platform for people to talk about it or give the feedback

53
00:03:42,046 --> 00:03:45,846
or reason? My issue. And then that part is

54
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:49,254
so important about the people because you need

55
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:53,286
to know that it's not the one person single

56
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:56,422
person project, it's the community,

57
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:59,942
right? So if the community, that means there are so many

58
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:03,686
people there, maybe they're user, they're evangelist,

59
00:04:03,798 --> 00:04:07,162
they're contributor or committer. So how to

60
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:11,614
invite more people to stay here to contributors to this community.

61
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:16,734
So that's more important. The key point then

62
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:21,022
if we want to make each of the mattress looks nice

63
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:24,638
or decent women, you take some actions, the actions

64
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:29,474
I give all of them here, this mind

65
00:04:29,592 --> 00:04:33,650
map. And later on I will use this mind

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,266
map to introduce each of them. So let's

67
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:40,438
get started. Okay, so today

68
00:04:40,524 --> 00:04:44,886
I will take our project as an example,

69
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:48,674
because this project actually at the beginning have

70
00:04:48,732 --> 00:04:52,282
zero star on GitHub. But now you can see here

71
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:56,662
if we want to use our metrics to evaluate

72
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:59,786
this project is healthy or not, is active or not.

73
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:02,698
We can use all of the metrics here.

74
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:06,574
For example, what's up about having Sophia here on

75
00:05:06,612 --> 00:05:10,046
his homepage you can see sharding Sophia is

76
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:14,066
the ecosystem to help to transfer your

77
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:18,510
monolithic database. For example MySQL or postgresql

78
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,866
to become a having architecture, right? And also

79
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:26,386
can provide, make it become the distributed

80
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:29,942
database and enhance this system with a lot of

81
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,666
user features, for example data automatically

82
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:37,478
encryption or decryption and SQL audits or

83
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:40,570
auto scaling on the Kubernetes, right?

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,022
And so you can see here women of the metrics on the GitHub

85
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,554
and it's already received, that's more than 17,000

86
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,982
stars and have a lot of forks. That means

87
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:55,854
people want to host it and

88
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:59,822
create their features based on this

89
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:03,534
ripo. And also it's already released

90
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:07,314
for more than 15 times. It's so big and

91
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:11,374
it's mature because there are so many release.

92
00:06:11,502 --> 00:06:15,050
And also it have a lot of GitHub

93
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,026
actions to guarantee the coding

94
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:23,030
quality and the feature quality, the stateability.

95
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,382
Plus you can see here it used the Apache license that

96
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:30,906
is in the commercial friendly and forward and users or

97
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:34,714
for other companies to consider it have the more

98
00:06:34,752 --> 00:06:38,074
than 400

99
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:42,474
people contributors towards here. So we

100
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:45,866
use the previous matches to evaluate

101
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:49,534
as example. And now if

102
00:06:49,572 --> 00:06:53,362
you want CTO, make your open source tech community become that

103
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,820
or better than that. What should we do?

104
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,860
Okay, oh, forget about that.

105
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,210
Apart from the Matrix on GitHub, you can see here

106
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,310
many people or many foundations are talking

107
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,342
about this project. You can see here a lot of

108
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:16,870
conference people talk about it, Infoq or VC

109
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,630
or the CNCF foundation,

110
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,340
right? So I will introduce them specific

111
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,910
steps or actions or strategies to make your community

112
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,246
become that or better than that. First you

113
00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:36,394
need to consider, you need to consider the key values

114
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:40,366
of your project. And that's the

115
00:07:40,388 --> 00:07:44,306
first important questions for you. Because you

116
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:48,002
know that why people want to give attention to this community.

117
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:51,362
CTO this project because they want CTO use it. They found it

118
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:54,482
interesting. It's in the channeling, right?

119
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:58,310
So if you, your community or your

120
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,200
project can really help people to solve their issues,

121
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,986
and can really help most of the people to solve

122
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,834
the most of their production issues, that means

123
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:13,194
people want to use it. It's useful for people.

124
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:16,970
So that creates the potential for your community

125
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,702
to become larger and larger. And if this

126
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:24,590
community can really help people or help the

127
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,414
mature people to solve their issue, that means you have the

128
00:08:28,452 --> 00:08:31,758
more potential to become the larger than

129
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,506
others. Because for example here I gave this

130
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:38,994
example diagrams, right? Most of the people will

131
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:42,722
use it to draw their flowchart, right?

132
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,198
Because most of the people they

133
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:49,814
needed to draw the flowchart or

134
00:08:49,932 --> 00:08:53,974
mind map of the stuff. So that means this project

135
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:57,834
can really help maturity planted people to

136
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:01,386
solve their real issues. So you can see were

137
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:05,194
many people connected or started because they

138
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:09,050
think it's useful. And also another

139
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,806
part, you need to consider that about training, because you

140
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:17,470
know that a lot of the Apache Java

141
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,082
project, for example Flink or PoSA,

142
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:24,514
or for having Sophia or the

143
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:28,750
other famous projects are considered

144
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,642
how to move their infrastructure or their project

145
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:36,146
into the cloud or into the Kubernetes.

146
00:09:36,258 --> 00:09:39,414
Because Kubernetes cloud is the future of the

147
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:43,206
tech, right? So even though all of the

148
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:47,142
wonderful projects were born in maybe five

149
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:50,554
years or six years, but now in this point

150
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:54,154
they needed to adopt the trending about the

151
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:58,646
new infrastructure, make their project become modern

152
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:02,406
at this point, right? So that means you needed

153
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:06,174
to consider the future features of your project,

154
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,950
make it evolved along with the time

155
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,330
with the people's needs. I can give another

156
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,606
example here actually approaches

157
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:21,646
software foundation. They have a category called Attic.

158
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:24,718
That means if your projects have no people,

159
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:29,382
interesting, no people want to maintain it, then your

160
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:34,082
project will be moved to the attic. That means frozen

161
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:37,994
for some times. So all of the key

162
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:41,562
values you need to consider and if you really help

163
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:45,530
people to solve it, that means you have the chance to do

164
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,574
the monetization. For example, Sharon Sophia

165
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:53,170
it's very active and helpful for projects

166
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,818
for people, especially in the database

167
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:01,646
cloud databases area. So we have the chance to

168
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:03,840
create our companies via ex.

169
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,822
So another part lets us consider about the asset

170
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:13,954
of your project. Because if you want to start from small,

171
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:17,174
that means you need to create a lot of asset for

172
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:20,966
this project to help your community or a project

173
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,930
run housely, right? And then attract

174
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:29,670
more people to join here. The first part is about the infrastructure,

175
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,466
the kernel part, because you need to consider how

176
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:37,302
to host your code base, how to do the CSCD,

177
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:41,370
how to do the test and how to pick up the license

178
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,734
copyright and how to create the platforms for

179
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:48,298
people to talk about it. And people can give your feedback

180
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:52,074
and gather help, right? So that's infrastructure

181
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:55,354
for your open source community. Actually GitHub,

182
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:59,234
it's not a pitch, it's a really good platform

183
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:03,010
for me to recommend for you because you know that

184
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,694
all of the issues, the questions or the

185
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:10,262
infrastructure, they help you to create

186
00:12:10,316 --> 00:12:13,810
it. They have a lot of infrastructure templates

187
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,994
for you to really kickstart your project or

188
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:21,926
community. There are so much GitHub action or useful

189
00:12:22,038 --> 00:12:25,498
marketplace for you to pick up to create your

190
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:29,370
coding base, tattoo, CI, CD license

191
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,266
or issues platform, the issues trackers.

192
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,662
So I think they're useful and recommend for you to

193
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,930
give a look. And last part, you need to consider the programming language,

194
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,714
because if you want to solve people issue, there are

195
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:49,298
many ways, many developmental language for you to

196
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:53,314
choose to pick up, you need to consider, because if you

197
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:57,366
pick up the niche, I mean language for you to

198
00:12:57,388 --> 00:13:01,046
do the programming, that means that you can only

199
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:04,726
find a small portion of people to become

200
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:08,860
your potential contributors. Here I gave this

201
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,666
programming language of the 2022. You can see

202
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:14,890
here the python, Java.

203
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,054
Oh, there's no the rust or the go, they are

204
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:23,934
so popular recently. So I recommend use of

205
00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:27,566
the programming language to develop your project and

206
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:31,694
to help people to solve their issues. Next part about

207
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:35,554
another part is the shelf your project as

208
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:39,074
the asset. Because even though you

209
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,978
have a good infrastructure to guarantee your code

210
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:45,570
quality, your testing, the stability,

211
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,542
you also need a lot of documents to

212
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,160
teach people how to use this project.

213
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,914
And you also need to help people know that what is project,

214
00:13:58,032 --> 00:14:01,270
what's the issues this project can help me solve,

215
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,722
right? So you need CTO document because you have no time to teach

216
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:09,546
everyone and people cannot to

217
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,862
read your code to know what

218
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:17,102
this project. So you need to document another

219
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:21,422
part about the articles to tell people that

220
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:25,538
what the issues this project focus on,

221
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:29,874
right? And also the code conduct because you

222
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:33,282
need more people to help you to create this

223
00:14:33,336 --> 00:14:36,982
project, right? So if there is no code conduct, that means

224
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:41,240
people just use their

225
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,054
habits to programming. That means later on you

226
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:50,760
found that the coding, it's out of the control and

227
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,346
it's a mess for you to maintain it.

228
00:14:56,448 --> 00:15:00,494
So you need some the code conduct or rules or

229
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:06,030
the policies to guarantee that everyone follow

230
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,902
that rules, the policies and to make

231
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:14,014
this the code base or make the feature introduction

232
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:17,826
part looks decent and looks almost

233
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:20,846
consistent, right? In the same style.

234
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:24,722
It's a long term work. You need to spend one,

235
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:28,374
two more, three years to create this

236
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:32,386
code base for your articles, for your document, for Alpha

237
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:36,006
sharing. Sophia, we actually spent three years,

238
00:15:36,188 --> 00:15:39,866
a lot of time to create our document base for

239
00:15:39,888 --> 00:15:43,162
people to use it. Another part, it's about

240
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:46,470
the community documents.

241
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,750
People always just focus on the user's document.

242
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,358
But forget your community document. What that means?

243
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:57,262
Community apartment. That means, for example, here, how to get

244
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:00,366
involved. How do I become the contributors here?

245
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:03,914
If I interested in some issues, how do I raise

246
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:06,898
my first pull request here? Right?

247
00:16:06,984 --> 00:16:10,386
What's the part? I can be part of that. All the stuff.

248
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:14,466
Because you need to tell people that, hey, we are so welcoming. We are

249
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:18,418
an open community. We welcome our contributors

250
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:21,334
to come here. CTo be part of this community.

251
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:24,950
You know that your community, you are not a single

252
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,602
person to remain it. So you need to pave the

253
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:32,058
way for your contributors to come here.

254
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:36,122
So you need the documents to tell them, right? So this

255
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:39,974
part people not

256
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,640
gave us too much attention, but so important.

257
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,414
Okay, so, yeah, that's all cases that

258
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:52,110
Shirley Sophie gave. And that part I need to talk about

259
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,778
the people. I mean, because lifers, for example,

260
00:16:55,864 --> 00:16:59,442
the approaches soviet foundation. They think that

261
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,740
the community overcoat. That means the people

262
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,230
overcoat. Because if you have a lot of people,

263
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,886
that means you have a lot of the fellows to

264
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:15,714
work with you. CTo make you feel fulfilled

265
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:19,162
and make you feel that it's both in your

266
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:22,410
effort to stay here. To help people. CTO solve their issue.

267
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,978
People give their feedback, read the issues,

268
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:30,290
read the poll request to help this community become decent,

269
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,806
become better and people like it,

270
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:37,774
right? That will encourage you to put more efforts to

271
00:17:37,812 --> 00:17:40,766
maintain this community, this project,

272
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:44,370
right? So the encouragement

273
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,882
from your community, from other people can

274
00:17:48,936 --> 00:17:52,734
become the incentive

275
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:55,650
for you to stay here, to maintain here, right?

276
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,306
So you need the contributors, you need the communities.

277
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:02,070
So how to attract their attention?

278
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,006
First, but you know that different

279
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:09,354
community have different idea about this part. For me,

280
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,300
I can give some the common ways.

281
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,282
The general approaches for you to consider the first.

282
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:20,026
And make your communication open. That means you

283
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:24,078
cannot just talk women stuff

284
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:27,822
only in a small group, right? Because you know that

285
00:18:27,876 --> 00:18:31,614
people want to know what is happening in this community. If you can

286
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:35,026
make a community become open, that means people can have

287
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,882
the chance to know more about it. And then maybe

288
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:42,974
some part of your talk can attract

289
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,878
their attention. And they want to be part of there,

290
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:49,160
right? And second, that means

291
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,750
the belongings. That means you need to create

292
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,082
some system. Not so much like

293
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:03,466
the hierarchy or system. But if you can

294
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:07,398
give the path for the people, the growing path.

295
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:11,086
It's like your career right at the beginning you are the

296
00:19:11,188 --> 00:19:14,846
junior programmer and then become the

297
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,666
senior. And you know there is a clear career

298
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:24,146
path for you to grow up and in community actually

299
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,510
were the PMC that means the project management

300
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,810
committee and the has libal is communities.

301
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,198
The later on is contributor and the user. If you

302
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:39,842
gave more efforts here and you have lost being

303
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:44,070
about our professional knowledge about this community's project that means

304
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,394
you know more about it and you will become.

305
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:51,660
You can not control but can

306
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,314
give more guidance to this community

307
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:59,578
help more people and the people more

308
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:03,198
trista your input or your idea

309
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:07,038
or they want support you to

310
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:11,694
hear, right? So that means you need to spend do

311
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:15,474
a lot of contributors to this community. It's the

312
00:20:15,512 --> 00:20:19,150
hierarchy of the Apache Software foundation.

313
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:23,234
Actually in Apache Charlie Sofia we also have the project

314
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:27,186
management committee. We will vote our contributors to

315
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:30,822
become the communities to really tell our

316
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:35,014
community that hey, this guy is so experienced here and they

317
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:38,550
really help this community

318
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,074
CTO grow up. So we really sax and we

319
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:45,350
also have the swags to give our contributors

320
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,874
our committees to Saxford efforts. Because you know

321
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:53,150
that people need the positive feedback

322
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,334
that will give their more energy,

323
00:20:56,452 --> 00:21:00,238
give their more instill the atom to stay here,

324
00:21:00,324 --> 00:21:03,618
right? Because everyone need the

325
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:06,770
positive encouraged. No matter

326
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,994
it's in the school, in the company

327
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:14,354
or here in the community. So how

328
00:21:14,392 --> 00:21:17,846
to join here or how to become the communities from the

329
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:21,302
contributor I gave the following items but today

330
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:25,430
I have no item enough time to talk

331
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,606
more. But in the future if I

332
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:33,190
can write some of the post on my twitter or linking

333
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:36,074
later on. Oh, I can give a case here.

334
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:39,174
This guy here is me. All this beautiful lady.

335
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:43,210
It's me and this guy, it's our

336
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,934
employee. It's a manager developer

337
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:50,974
manager of Savior. Yes, our company actually we

338
00:21:51,012 --> 00:21:55,086
pick it up or we invited this guy to join our company because at

339
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:58,618
the beginning he just the contributors of this shirt

340
00:21:58,634 --> 00:22:01,602
named Sophia. And we found he really did a good job.

341
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:05,490
So we voted to become the PMC project

342
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,266
manager committee of this project. And then we found hey,

343
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:13,218
will you by him. Hey, you really did a good job ensuring Sophia.

344
00:22:13,394 --> 00:22:16,502
And now we have our Sophia's company.

345
00:22:16,556 --> 00:22:19,962
Do you want to join were and to

346
00:22:20,016 --> 00:22:23,674
make your women source become your career. And this guy said,

347
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:27,434
wow, it's wonderful. I really like this chance. So he

348
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,182
become the manager here. Yeah,

349
00:22:30,256 --> 00:22:33,486
that's a good case. Later on about you

350
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:37,166
needed to create a lot of the cooperation with other

351
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:41,422
media or other communicate to

352
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:45,122
invite more people to join here or to know more about

353
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:49,742
having about your community, about your projects.

354
00:22:49,806 --> 00:22:52,914
Right. So that's why we write

355
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:56,526
this book. We wrote this book. We gave the talk on staff

356
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,518
overflow and we give a lovely tad talk in different

357
00:23:00,604 --> 00:23:04,274
conference. Because I think this community is useful

358
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:08,378
for people. So I want to share my experience because I really

359
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:11,498
get a lot of help from the community.

360
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:15,062
Now it's a good time for me to do the feedback,

361
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:18,586
to share my experience.

362
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:22,154
Maybe that will help someone,

363
00:23:22,352 --> 00:23:24,940
some of the audience that worlds be perfect.

364
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,886
Right? Okay. Here. Because I

365
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,726
wrote a lot of articles. Some guys saw my article and they think hey,

366
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:37,370
they can use my article to quickly kick started

367
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,150
their project in their production environment.

368
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,722
So this guy come from

369
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:49,810
the delivery hero. They use the hero

370
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,434
the Korea branch and they use Apache having

371
00:23:54,482 --> 00:23:58,102
Sophia to solve their database, sharding and

372
00:23:58,156 --> 00:24:01,894
distributed issue in their real production and

373
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:05,610
give us feedback. We feel so good. We think that

374
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,058
we really did a lot of good job and

375
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:13,482
our users think we are useful.

376
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:17,374
So I think that this feeling is

377
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:21,214
so good. Right. And also here the

378
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:25,618
JD.com is the big online

379
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:29,380
shopping company in China. And so

380
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,326
they used the MySQl plus Apache having

381
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:36,626
Sophia to create their sharding distributed

382
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:40,134
system. So the mysql found this

383
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:44,214
case. Everything is so good. So they connected it.

384
00:24:44,332 --> 00:24:48,106
Yeah. Then the last question I

385
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,242
want to say that be patient with

386
00:24:51,296 --> 00:24:54,970
the progress, you know that everything small from

387
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,186
the small. So we need to be

388
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:02,414
patient with all the stuff and persist doing

389
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:06,302
the routine, the common things and later on that

390
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:09,726
will become the magic. And I believe

391
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:13,200
if you really love open source women like the

392
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,670
tech, technology or stem,

393
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,542
I just want to share my experience and hope you can get

394
00:25:22,596 --> 00:25:25,270
something from my talk.

395
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,580
And good luck. Yeah, see you next time.
