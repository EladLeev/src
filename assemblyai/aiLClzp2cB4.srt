00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,154
Everyone and welcome to Conf France 42 and

2
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:16,390
thank you for attending my presentation on unlocking sites through incident

3
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,346
management reports. My name is Andre, I work for Sporting Tech as

4
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:23,882
an incident team leader and report is part of my

5
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:27,402
day to day weekly report, monthly reports, let's say

6
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:31,562
internal reports, reports for stakeholders. So this is being not only

7
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:35,580
on this current job, but previously also a big part of,

8
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,378
of my work and actually a personal passion. So thank

9
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:43,426
you so much for attending this presentation here with

10
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:46,782
me. We're going to have a light presentation.

11
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:49,480
We're going to talk about basically six points.

12
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,594
The essence. Incident management team lead mining,

13
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:59,362
insights from incident data, fueling platform improvements,

14
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:03,686
customer centric perspective, optimizing resource allocation

15
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:07,446
and enhancing incident reaction.

16
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:10,986
So as I said, very live presentation. We were

17
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:14,494
just going to talk about overall topics here and

18
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:18,142
how these incidents help. Incident management team lead SE

19
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:22,062
helps us achieve better platform and better

20
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:24,560
customer satisfaction in the end of the day.

21
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,862
So first of all, we need to understand what is the incident cycle.

22
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:32,722
This is the first step. So incident cycle, we can divide it in

23
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:37,090
five major steps. First detection

24
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,762
where what's going on, we identify

25
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:45,334
an issue and we need to tackle it and we pass to step number

26
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,902
two, investigation, understand root cause and

27
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:53,114
find out a way to mitigate or permanently fix it.

28
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:56,646
Step three, we are ready to fix the issues we are fixing

29
00:03:56,678 --> 00:03:59,910
can issue and we're analyzing all the fixes,

30
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,994
deploy new codes, do the necessary communicating

31
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:07,454
with stakeholders and clients that we are

32
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:10,570
fixing these issue four point recovery.

33
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,734
Here is the part where we going to monitor, basically we

34
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:18,226
recovered, we fixed the issue,

35
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:22,290
we are recovering, we are seeing all different

36
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,954
dashboards to understand these platform health and

37
00:04:25,992 --> 00:04:29,894
we go on to take care of all the actions that are left after

38
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:34,342
an incident, see if there's something

39
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:37,480
that needs to be revised and so on.

40
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,740
Fifth point is post event activity where

41
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,690
we collect data along all the points. So this data

42
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,526
increases from detection to recovery.

43
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:53,322
And on points five is where we're going to analyze and we're going to actually

44
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,586
start here with our incident management team

45
00:04:56,698 --> 00:05:00,350
lead where we have data to see how we can improve

46
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,630
all this incidents cycle and our time for reaction and SLA

47
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,530
for that. Incident management team lead can

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,482
have a role, a purpose and key

49
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:17,698
metrics that they can differ company to company.

50
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:21,046
So I just try to list here the ones that I consider the

51
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:25,058
most important ones for the role, the role

52
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:30,990
of the incident management team lead to capture incidents,

53
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,780
what's going on, how many capture the information

54
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,526
that happened during the month to coordinate

55
00:05:41,638 --> 00:05:45,326
between teams for a better reaction in

56
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:49,214
the future. For same incidents or for new

57
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:52,800
incidents documents, all the process

58
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,786
that we are dealing with and how we are working

59
00:05:56,968 --> 00:06:00,562
and to prevent further incidents like this

60
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:04,414
so we can learn and prevent incidents

61
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:08,034
to have a more reliable platform. These key

62
00:06:08,072 --> 00:06:12,342
metrics, and again, this can differ company

63
00:06:12,396 --> 00:06:16,342
by company. I'm just listing here the four ones

64
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:20,006
that I think that are most important, ones that are severity of the

65
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:23,782
case, MTTR, time to resolve the case, slos.

66
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:27,894
So the agreements that we have with our clients

67
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:32,166
and internal or external slos and frequency,

68
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:36,174
how many times these things are happening and how many they

69
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:40,318
are repetitive. So basically this is what I consider

70
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,806
the most important key metrics for incident

71
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,790
management, team lead.

72
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,594
And we go on, and we go step

73
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:54,338
by step, month by month, and we are collecting data. Now,

74
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,906
this data that we collect, again, will depend on the company.

75
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:01,686
Some companies are going to focus more on the financial parts, others on

76
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:05,880
the report part. So this depends actually on the company that you're working for.

77
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,582
So basically, month by month here, the idea is

78
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:14,022
you collect affected services, you collect quantities,

79
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:17,930
you can collect quantity of incidents happening,

80
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,634
you can collect how

81
00:07:22,672 --> 00:07:26,350
was the SLA, how long it was to resolve the different issues,

82
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,806
the average to mitigate an issue and so on.

83
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:33,550
So here is going to differ again, as I said, company by company.

84
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,154
But the idea here is month by month,

85
00:07:37,192 --> 00:07:41,182
you collect information day by day. Even in one single incident,

86
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:45,298
as mentioned previously, you can collect data

87
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:47,940
on different steps of it.

88
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,806
And now we have data, we collected data and now

89
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:55,830
we need to understand what are we going to do with this data.

90
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,718
So data per se doesn't say anything, it's just

91
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:03,254
random numbers, text, not even

92
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:06,666
formulas yet we don't know what's going on

93
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:10,090
there. So the data, to be able

94
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,706
for us to work with the data, we need to basically, first we need

95
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:17,534
to can the data, we need to revise all the data, understand that

96
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:21,706
if there's any typos, making sure that all the fields are matching

97
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:25,614
the ones that we want, make sure

98
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:29,086
that there's no empty values, or if there's empty

99
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:32,626
values, they have a reason. So basically make sure that the data is the

100
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,740
most trustful possible.

101
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,300
Second, structure this data. So we need to

102
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,622
find a way to relate data.

103
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,442
Relate information from, for example, if you work with Excel,

104
00:08:47,586 --> 00:08:51,266
I love to use Excel to not only to clean, but also to structure

105
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:52,280
my information.

106
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:58,234
Sometimes you have different tables and you need to find a way to relate them.

107
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:02,266
Or in order to use a pivot table, for example, you need to

108
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:05,642
make sure that this has a structure on this data

109
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:08,800
and on the same report.

110
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,306
And then my favorite part is visualize.

111
00:09:13,418 --> 00:09:17,862
Here is the part where we create the graphs, the charts

112
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:21,842
where you start seeing things happen in a most more

113
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:25,940
easy way to be honest. For me is my third

114
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,230
part of it. And now let's see an example

115
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,990
on how this works. So after we clean,

116
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,406
after we structure, now we visualize the data basically.

117
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:42,406
So these we can identify and with this we can identify patterns

118
00:09:42,438 --> 00:09:46,202
and trends. So transactional services were

119
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:50,058
the most affected ones let's say as an example,

120
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:53,638
the increase of incidents in the transactional services lead to a drop of

121
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:55,470
5% of revenue.

122
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:00,346
This we can see also that there's an increase of incidents quarter

123
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:04,670
by quarter. So here we are starting to relate three different metrics.

124
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,942
Logging access teams are performing quick and efficient

125
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:11,650
on these incidents with low MTTR.

126
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,970
They are on average quarter by quarter happening

127
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,940
on the same amount. And we can see that these

128
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,502
MTTR, sorry, is low. So here

129
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:28,710
give us more input on how we cross. Information tools attack another

130
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,230
example with low or no end user impact. So although

131
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,910
it's happening with increase on the last two quarters,

132
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,450
we can see that there's basically no impact.

133
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,706
Now we have different topics, different information

134
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:49,438
that we crossed. How can we prioritize the things that we need to do.

135
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:52,958
And how we're going to do that is by using a

136
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:56,686
prioritize matrix. So every time that you don't

137
00:10:56,718 --> 00:11:00,162
know how to prioritize, just look at this, it's very

138
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:04,530
easy. I love this tool. And here basically

139
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,286
we're going to cross again your urgency

140
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:11,650
with impact. So we're going to understand what is these critical

141
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,414
thing that we need to address the most. And as for my experience,

142
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:19,186
I know that on the previous graph the transactional

143
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:22,758
services will be the first one to address followed

144
00:11:22,774 --> 00:11:26,874
by these login access and the DDoS stack due to

145
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:30,650
the cross information. But every time that you can have here this

146
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,822
prioritize matrix, that helps you

147
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:37,694
understand what can you do. And with

148
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,294
this after improvements, after you address the things you can see,

149
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:44,878
then compare year by year how

150
00:11:44,964 --> 00:11:48,850
your efforts result in a positive

151
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,770
way of working and a positive revenue for these company.

152
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,574
You can see that using the insights of incident report and understanding

153
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:59,894
what's going on, you will be able to see

154
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:03,954
decrease on your incidents increase on the MTTR,

155
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:07,734
on slos and reduce the impact for

156
00:12:07,772 --> 00:12:11,518
customers which returns

157
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:15,100
in a higher revenue for the different companies.

158
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,142
And this is not only internally. So these improvements

159
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:23,210
are like a cycle. So like a sign BIOS

160
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,454
if you got my point, because customers experience

161
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:30,320
also improvements customers,

162
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,880
the service gets more popularity among customers.

163
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,426
One friend tells the other friend, the family says, comment this

164
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:43,026
service is reliable, you guys need

165
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:46,466
to try it. So basically

166
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:50,770
by improving our platform, we can improve customer satisfaction,

167
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,502
which again will improve the company and will help

168
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:57,880
companies expand and gain popularity along

169
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,410
the market. That areas operating.

170
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,130
Moving on how also incidents

171
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,178
reports can give you more insights on other areas.

172
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:18,430
Let's talk about resource allocation.

173
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,374
Resource allocation. So there's a new project in the company or

174
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:28,500
there's a development or something that we need to fix

175
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,834
came from an incident for example. And we're going to

176
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:36,706
define what we need to do. We're going to plan the

177
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:40,918
actions and now is the part to identify the technical resources needed

178
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:44,946
and identify the workforce needed. Here is where incident management

179
00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:48,920
reports can give a big insight into this.

180
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,626
With the incident management report we can see that we have x

181
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:57,420
amount of incidents and this took us x amount of

182
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,100
developers and this amount of hours.

183
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,146
With these information, with gathering

184
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:09,374
more and more information throughout the different months,

185
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,570
we can understand that in order to tackle

186
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,250
certain type of issues, we will need more or less

187
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,746
people. So here is where incident management report

188
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:23,394
can give a big insight on this and after

189
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:27,394
implement six points. Follow up,

190
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:30,662
follow up document everything, see how this

191
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:34,466
can impact and use the incident management

192
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:38,262
report to understand how was

193
00:14:38,316 --> 00:14:42,010
the development and how these

194
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,570
actions that were just taken by the company improve

195
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,850
the company on the incident. Part of you, part of it.

196
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,280
Sorry. And the benefits are clear.

197
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,790
Best MTTR,

198
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,998
best Slos increase on

199
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:05,246
the GGR. And my favorite one,

200
00:15:05,348 --> 00:15:08,914
employee satisfaction with less work.

201
00:15:08,952 --> 00:15:12,802
With best resource allocation, people feel

202
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:16,754
less stress, they work better, they areas happier at

203
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,438
work and this only brings benefits to

204
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:23,846
the company. Now with all

205
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:27,654
of this said and to conclude the presentation, let's see

206
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:31,202
how revolutionizing incident reaction can happen with

207
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:34,490
incident management reports.

208
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,226
We saw all of these steps till now and we can collect information with

209
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:43,494
every single thing. By leveraging our past, we can

210
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:47,386
prevent or predict till an extent

211
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:51,294
the future. This is just a representation on

212
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:54,490
how we can just start improvements,

213
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,922
alerts and preventive actions before things happen.

214
00:15:57,976 --> 00:16:01,794
Because we know, we learn now that things might happen this way

215
00:16:01,832 --> 00:16:05,650
or that. So we can prevent them to happen and be more

216
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,050
preventive than reactive.

217
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:13,046
We can improve our platform and increase our stability on

218
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:17,160
the platform to reduce the amount of incidents that we have.

219
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,154
And all of this will lead to increase of the revenue that

220
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:25,900
can be translated into more investment into

221
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:30,682
the platform. Again, learning our

222
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:34,710
past can teach us a lot of ways to tackle

223
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,710
the situations and to act in the more preventive

224
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,290
way and not so reactive.

225
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,338
And that was it for me, guys. I hope you enjoy.

226
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:49,794
I hope I was able to waken up

227
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:53,506
a little bit of curiosity in yourselves about

228
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:56,720
reporting and hope to see you soon.
