1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,174
Jamaica real

2
00:00:06,212 --> 00:00:09,578
time feedback into the behavior of your distributed systems

3
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:12,538
and observing changes, exceptions.

4
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:16,014
Errors in real time allows you to not only experiment with

5
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:19,166
confidence, but respond instantly to

6
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:20,480
get things working again.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:47,482
Code hi.

8
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,374
Today I'm going to talk about digital ecology and

9
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:54,634
how to mitigate the carbon footprint of websites.

10
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:58,666
Let's begin. What is digital ecology?

11
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:03,030
It is a field of study about the interdependence of digital systems

12
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,410
like the Internet and the natural environment. So, long story

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,834
short, everything we do online and what we do offline with

14
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:14,226
our devices generates carbon footprint. But to be

15
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:17,926
clear, digital ecology is not about taking a step back.

16
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:21,254
It's not stopping people from using the Internet. It's all

17
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:24,594
about introducing more sustainable,

18
00:01:24,722 --> 00:01:27,110
greener habits and routines.

19
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,780
You might wonder now, how does the Internet emit co2?

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,574
It starts with data collection. So with servers, with data centers

21
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:41,742
and the cloud. And if we think about the cloud, we might think about something

22
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:45,646
white, light, bright or in the sky. But the truth is

23
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:49,198
that storing data in the cloud means storing data

24
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:52,458
in these large facilities called the data centers,

25
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:56,514
which have to be powered up and cooled down 24 hours,

26
00:01:56,632 --> 00:02:01,086
seven days per week. For example, storing 100gb

27
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,546
of data in a data center emits 0.2

28
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:08,294
fonts of co2 per year. And this

29
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:11,926
is 700,000 times more than if

30
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:14,760
you would be storing this data on your hard drive.

31
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,030
Another fact is that data centers are responsible

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,130
for 1% of world's electricity consumption.

33
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,182
Next, data transferring via the infrastructure,

34
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:32,062
via the telecom infrastructure. So power lines and everything here

35
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:35,918
has to be powered up as well. And last but not least,

36
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:38,880
end devices. So, for example,

37
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,502
charging smartphones, the energy that is needed for that overtook

38
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:47,394
the energy that is needed for charging laptops and pcs in

39
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,794
2020. And producing and charging smartphones is

40
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:55,018
actually responsible for 1% of all global

41
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:57,746
emissions. Pretty impressive.

42
00:02:57,938 --> 00:03:01,702
And I'm not even mentioning these natural resources that

43
00:03:01,756 --> 00:03:04,630
are needed for manufacturing our smartphones.

44
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,958
So is it important? It quite is. The ICT

45
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:13,446
industry stands for 4% of all greenhouse

46
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:16,746
gases. And if we go back to

47
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:19,594
the cloud by 2025,

48
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:23,598
we predict that in the cloud we're going to be storing 100

49
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:27,322
zetabytes, which will be emitting 200 billion

50
00:03:27,386 --> 00:03:29,600
tones of co2 per year.

51
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,560
What can we do about it?

52
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,414
These are some simple techniques that you can be using in your daily

53
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:43,346
life. So let's start with emails. By 2023,

54
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:49,522
the predictions are that every day there's going to be 347,000,000,000

55
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:53,506
emails sent out every day. And sending one email results

56
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:56,040
in existing 4 grams of co2.

57
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,838
Another factor is that storing emails emits

58
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:04,934
19 grams of co2. So deleting

59
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:09,098
emails or just sending them less really makes some sense.

60
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:13,182
And one average user stores 10,000

61
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:15,550
emails on a mailbox.

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,978
So deleting emails,

63
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:22,078
unsubscribing to spam, and using

64
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:25,730
alternative messaging tools like slack or the

65
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,300
old sums is really important.

66
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,906
And if we think about the size of emails, you can, for example,

67
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:37,314
try to remove an image from your footer to decrease

68
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:40,200
these size and thus emit less co2.

69
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,910
When it comes to browsing, there are some alternative

70
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,330
to Google. So to our most favorite

71
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,382
search engine. So for example, there are search engines like Ecosia

72
00:04:53,446 --> 00:04:56,906
or Lilo, which are more eco friendly, let's say.

73
00:04:57,008 --> 00:05:00,770
And there is also the DuckDuckgo, which is much more ethical.

74
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,166
Another factor is closing tabs, because if they still remain open,

75
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,326
they still have a connection with the servers. If you

76
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:13,234
remember the address, write it directly in the

77
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:18,014
tab. Think about marking some of your favorite pages

78
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:21,682
by adding bookmarks and briefing the keywords that you use.

79
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:25,054
It's also important to erase from time to time your

80
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:27,750
old media on social media platforms.

81
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,242
And when it comes to devices, changing smartphones

82
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:36,022
or computers left often is very good

83
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:38,906
for the environment. So imagine that, for example,

84
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:43,306
replacing every 6th year instead of every fourth year,

85
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:47,450
your computer emits 190

86
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,614
kilos of co2 less. So this is quite

87
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:55,306
a large change. It's also about deleting

88
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:58,794
mobile apps that you don't use, about disabling mobile

89
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:02,426
notifications. And for example, you can try also unplugging

90
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,020
your router for the night.

91
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,682
Let's go now to the main topic of today's speech. So,

92
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:14,706
websites, did you know that every day 250,000

93
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:18,134
new web pages are being published and each

94
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:21,926
of them generates 1.8 grams of co2,

95
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:25,254
what sums up to 216

96
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:29,082
annually. And this assumes that a web page is being

97
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:33,210
visited 1200 times monthly

98
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,746
and this number, so 216

99
00:06:38,768 --> 00:06:44,238
less this much as for driving almost 1000

100
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:48,094
gasoline car. So how much co2

101
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:51,440
does your website produce? Have you ever wondered that?

102
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,842
To check it out, you can use this popular tool

103
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:59,410
online called the website carbon Calculator.

104
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,854
It is very clear about how to calculate the carbon

105
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:07,814
emissions. It's very transparent, so I can strongly recommend it.

106
00:07:07,932 --> 00:07:12,214
And here it's enough to just copy paste your URL here

107
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:16,006
and click the calculate button. So how

108
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:18,954
to calculate the co2 emissions of these website?

109
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:22,694
First we have to consider the data transfer of an average

110
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,890
visit. So according to carbon calculator,

111
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,366
the data transfer of the first visit stands only for 25%

112
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:36,346
of all visits. And the data transfer of the returning

113
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:39,614
visits stands for 75% and it is

114
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:43,434
equal these energy of the website multiplied by 2% because

115
00:07:43,492 --> 00:07:47,650
already some data was cached before. So during the first visit

116
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,698
then we have to consider the energy of the website,

117
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:55,334
which is equal to the website size multiplied by the end

118
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:58,854
user traffic, and the end user traffic here is equal to

119
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:04,614
almost 1.

120
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,922
Last but not least, the emissions of zero to

121
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:12,266
per one visit. So this is equal to the data transfer

122
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,990
of an average visit multiplied by the energy emissions.

123
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:19,946
And the energy emissions vary from country to country.

124
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:23,646
So what this web page is using and what we

125
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:27,374
are using in the tool is 442

126
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:30,794
grams/kw hour. So this is the global average

127
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:32,270
of energy emissions.

128
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,394
So to sum it up, the emissions of co2 per

129
00:08:37,432 --> 00:08:41,134
one visit are equal 75% multiplied

130
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:44,734
by the website size, plus 25% multiplied

131
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:47,986
by 2% multiplied by the websites.

132
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:52,034
And this is multiplied then by the end user trapping

133
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,910
and by the energy emissions.

134
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,090
So what can we do to create more sustainable websites?

135
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,038
First, let's think about the programming language.

136
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:07,866
I assume that you are all coding your websites in

137
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:11,258
either JavaScript or typeScript. And here, as you can

138
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:14,394
see on the graph, JavaScript is a little bit better than typescript

139
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:17,194
and much much better than for example Ruby,

140
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:20,270
Python or of course the worst.

141
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,194
But of course if we talk about websites, it's much better

142
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:27,700
to use JavaScript or typescript than platforms like

143
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,282
Wix or WordPress. Because then we have more

144
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:35,402
control over the code. We can more easily remove some largeunnecessary

145
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:38,040
parts and implement any changes.

146
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,766
When it comes to libraries. Here you can see some of

147
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:47,666
the most popular ones with

148
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,420
their emissions. So for example,

149
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,834
you can rethink if all of the libraries that you're adding are really

150
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:59,942
needed. Because for example for load you could maybe try using

151
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,834
just plain JavaScript, or you could use the already built in fetch

152
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:08,814
instead of adding some largeunnecessary libraries when

153
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:12,142
it comes to calls to external APIs, think about

154
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:15,886
reducing the number of calls. So basically rethinking the logic

155
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:20,274
of your call about caching data both on the frontend

156
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:23,778
and on the back end side. And as I already mentioned,

157
00:10:23,864 --> 00:10:26,950
just using plain JavaScript or lighter libraries.

158
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,642
When it comes to resources, there are three most important factors

159
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:36,662
that you have to consider. So images, videos and

160
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:40,202
fonts. When it comes to images, it's best to save them in

161
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:43,466
SVG or Webpy. Webpy is a

162
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:46,954
very highly compressed format and SVG is

163
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:49,500
a vector format. So all of them,

164
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,626
the file sizes of images saved

165
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:57,774
in these formats are much less than

166
00:10:57,972 --> 00:11:01,534
if these would be saved in for example pNg. So here

167
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:05,410
you can see like 95% of a difference. And here you can see

168
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,814
again a table with the corresponding

169
00:11:08,862 --> 00:11:12,366
co2 emissions based on the file format for this image

170
00:11:12,398 --> 00:11:15,906
shown on the left side. When it comes to

171
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:19,138
videos, a sibling format is Webm.

172
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:22,950
So it's also a highly compressed format which I strongly recommend.

173
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,406
And when it comes to fonts, it's of course better to

174
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:29,258
use the system fonts than these hosted online.

175
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:32,874
And if we think about the formats then the most

176
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:36,300
popular format is TTF, but it's also

177
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,706
the less sustainable one,

178
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:43,358
so it's better to use wof two. And here you

179
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:47,006
can see that by just changing these font format we can get up

180
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,654
to -70% of co2 reductions. And of

181
00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:54,514
course a user will not see the difference. So all these changes

182
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,220
will not influence the quality of your website.

183
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,586
Talking about colors, it's really good if you could enable a

184
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:07,238
dark mode of your website. And here you can see what is

185
00:12:07,404 --> 00:12:10,726
the energy efficiency of different colors on all emits

186
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:14,594
screens hosting

187
00:12:14,722 --> 00:12:17,946
so every time you pick a hosting provider, take a look

188
00:12:17,968 --> 00:12:21,910
at the power user usage effectiveness. So Poe

189
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,514
of the data center that your hosting provider is using,

190
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:29,338
the lower the number the better. Think also

191
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:33,406
about the policy of your hosting provider because

192
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:37,610
some of them are using for example green employee behavior policies,

193
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,242
they are planning to plant trees and so on and so forth.

194
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:45,026
So they are doing much more than just using some

195
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:48,642
less power user effective data

196
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:52,466
centers. And it's of course good to

197
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,300
use a hosting provider that uses renewable energy.

198
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,090
And if you don't know where to look for a green existing provider,

199
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,400
I recommend to open the green web foundation website

200
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,400
and take a look at some options there.

201
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,854
Last but not least, user data collection. So it's

202
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:16,838
about tracking users, it's about personalized

203
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:21,022
ads and collecting the data. And here is an

204
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:24,814
example of USA Today which was a web

205
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:28,734
page, which still is a web page, but after the

206
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:32,320
EU introduced these GDPR policy,

207
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,062
it started to run faster.

208
00:13:36,126 --> 00:13:39,326
So actually it was loading 91% faster,

209
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:41,730
so it became these much lighter.

210
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:46,646
And why should we be doing all this? So first of course we can

211
00:13:46,668 --> 00:13:51,026
mitigate the carbon footprint and thus we can also save electrical

212
00:13:51,058 --> 00:13:54,742
energy. This results also in shorter loading time,

213
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:58,166
which is really essential for uses. And for example,

214
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:01,734
here's a statistic that 53% of users

215
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:05,210
can be lost if a website loads longer than in 3 seconds.

216
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,860
And with shorter loading time we can improve SEO as well.

217
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,106
So you don't have to remember all these techniques

218
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:19,594
by heart. But if you want to please read this presentation

219
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,806
once more. You can also read a book called sustainable

220
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:27,330
web design. I can strongly recommend this one. It's written by Tom Greenwood.

221
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,650
But together with my team I developed a tool

222
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,910
called eclint. Eclint is Alvinter.

223
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,882
It works very similar like Athlint,

224
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:42,146
but what it does, it proposes possible code improvements to mitigate

225
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:46,354
the carbon footprint of websites and makes them basically more sustainable.

226
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:50,022
And it contains of two elements. So eclint

227
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:54,182
and this is more or less like s eclint and eclint style

228
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:58,122
which can be compared to for example, stylint. Hope that you know

229
00:14:58,256 --> 00:15:01,478
these tools and eclint style is for CSS

230
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:04,814
and CSS like languages. And underneath here

231
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:08,654
you can see an example of how you can be using eclint, what kind

232
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:13,310
of command it was and what change did it implement.

233
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,858
This is the list of features that we want to implement by the end of

234
00:15:17,864 --> 00:15:21,906
the year. And them ones marked in blue are the

235
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:25,506
ones that we already implemented and the violet ones are the

236
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:29,366
ones that we are still working on. And what

237
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:33,810
we hope to achieve is that we can reduce with eclint

238
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,062
the emissions even by 88%. So according to our

239
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:40,310
calculations, we hope this would be doable after

240
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,846
comparing some heavy websites

241
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:47,706
to the lighter ones. And for example, so I mentioned in

242
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:50,974
the beginning that every day 250,000 new

243
00:15:51,012 --> 00:15:55,150
websites are being published. So assuming that they would be visited

244
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,674
10,000 times a monthly, this would emits

245
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:03,286
54 million annually.

246
00:16:03,418 --> 00:16:07,618
And this is equal to driving 220,000,000

247
00:16:07,624 --> 00:16:11,940
gasoline can by reducing this number by 88%,

248
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,200
suddenly we get 26 million kilometer only.

249
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,154
So how to get started with Eclint?

250
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:24,966
First of course you have to have node installed. Then you have

251
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:29,130
to install eclint, eclint style and eclint style

252
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,378
with the recommended config. Then you have to initialize the project

253
00:16:34,464 --> 00:16:38,122
with the recommended config and you have to run

254
00:16:38,176 --> 00:16:41,710
it. So run eclint and eclint style.

255
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,920
We are still working on IdE.

256
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,882
So soon it is going to be even much easier

257
00:16:52,026 --> 00:16:55,970
to start using Eclint. And as this is an open

258
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,746
source tool, it's completely free to use. And if

259
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,714
