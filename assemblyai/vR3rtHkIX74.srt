00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,498
Hello everybody, my name is Tomasz Manugiewicz

2
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:46,134
and today I would like to spend this 30 minutes with you talking

3
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:49,190
about CTO view on DevOps transformation.

4
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,726
Starting with the word DevOps, I would love

5
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:56,926
to ask you, what do you think about this word? What does it

6
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:01,022
mean for you? Usually it means two things.

7
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:04,574
The first thing that people say is that DevOps

8
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:08,274
is a mindset. What that really is. We'll dig

9
00:01:08,312 --> 00:01:11,940
into it in a second. But on the other hand,

10
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,086
some engineers say that DevOps is a tool chain. We have

11
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:19,382
a lot of tools that we would like to use in our project,

12
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:23,366
and that's DevOps. So that's also right.

13
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:26,694
DevOps is actually the mindset and

14
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:30,474
the tool chain. So the way we think about tools and

15
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:33,770
others and our technology and the tools we are

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,380
using. Speaking of technology,

17
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,722
simplifying the process a little bit, we have development

18
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:45,706
activities going on. Those activities produce some jar file,

19
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,130
for example, and we put this jar file

20
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,894
deploy on the server and ask operations guys to maintain

21
00:01:52,942 --> 00:01:56,846
the observed. That's the software development

22
00:01:56,878 --> 00:01:59,460
in a very big nutshell, right?

23
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,738
However, when we dig into the details on

24
00:02:04,744 --> 00:02:08,930
the development side, there are a lot of plenty

25
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,310
activities like architecture. We need to design

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,846
the software, we need to plan the architecture, then we

27
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:19,100
need to program, produce a code.

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,274
We need to make sure that our code is merged to

29
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:27,450
the one project. So we need version control systems.

30
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,754
We then deploy to various environments

31
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:35,002
and we implement logging mechanisms,

32
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:38,974
right? So that's the development piece of work that we do.

33
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,426
On the other hand, there is operations piece of work. So monitoring

34
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,634
our software, how it behaves, how it performs, and so

35
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:49,566
on, observing the logs that we implemented and patching

36
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,450
our software with the new versions and fixes.

37
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,866
All right. But in the middle there is magic

38
00:02:56,898 --> 00:03:00,754
thing, deployment, deployment to staging environment.

39
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:04,738
We can have the UAT environment, so user acceptance tests,

40
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:07,886
we can have a pre prod environment, prod environment,

41
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:12,170
hidden product environment, even, or hidden pre prod environment.

42
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,058
Obviously in various organizations we

43
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:19,820
do it differently, but that's how it looks in general.

44
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,418
And now this middle section,

45
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:27,102
nowadays we replace by infrastructure as a code

46
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:30,746
approach, by containers, implementing Docker

47
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:35,550
or other containers, by orchestration mechanisms,

48
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,134
by configuration management, CI CD pipeline

49
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,566
logging, monitoring and so on and so forth.

50
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:47,654
And this part could potentially belong to our

51
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:51,410
development world and development team, or could belong to operations

52
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,142
team. And it differs from the company

53
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:58,582
to company. And that's where the DevOps

54
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:02,794
core of DevOps, DevOps heart is. I would say so.

55
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:06,102
DevOps for me is a development plus operations,

56
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,254
development people, programmers and

57
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,174
operations people coming together in

58
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,962
order to have efficient software, sometimes developers

59
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:21,854
needs to do, and they would like to do something from operations side

60
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:25,074
of things. Sometimes operations guys would like to do

61
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:29,214
something from developers. And those two activities

62
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:33,122
combined together is a DevOps for me. So that's why we are talking here

63
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:36,918
about mindset, because it's a

64
00:04:37,084 --> 00:04:40,482
set of our mind, how we will approach our collaboration

65
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,270
together using those tools.

66
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,454
Obviously, everyone is talking about this kind

67
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:52,214
of this picture. Everyone is talking about those tools.

68
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:55,578
We use puppet, we use chef Docker, you've already mentioned

69
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:59,226
everyone is jenkins, right? And build pipelines and so on

70
00:04:59,248 --> 00:05:02,686
and so forth. So that's not a tough thing.

71
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:06,254
We can learn about it, we have skills to

72
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:09,614
use it. We are curious about how it works as well.

73
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:13,138
So that's very interesting for us. What's difficult

74
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:16,546
is who will be using which tool,

75
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:20,606
what are the standards, how will communicate together and collaborate

76
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:24,270
together. And that's where this transformation

77
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,866
word comes into play. Because let's imagine the old monolithic

78
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:32,886
architecture of our system and old monolithic structure of our company,

79
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:37,218
right? In order to transform it to microservices.

80
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:41,206
This is not just only about transforming our technology

81
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,860
stack, it's about transforming away ways of working,

82
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,034
it's about transforming our cooperation, communication and so on.

83
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:52,746
So that's why we talk about transformation. Either it's DevOps

84
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:57,178
transformation, or agile transformation, or any other kind of transformation

85
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,606
is about changing the way we work. We used to

86
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:04,034
work, so that's why it's so important to know

87
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,050
and so difficult to implement.

88
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,090
So how to implement that? We have state a,

89
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,586
for example, the monolithic architecture and the system corresponding

90
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:19,350
with our monolithic organizational structure. And we have state

91
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,378
b, beautiful, shiny microservice architecture,

92
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,754
orchestrated on the cloud, everything is automated

93
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:31,260
and so on. So that's two space.

94
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,722
On the other hand, we have

95
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:39,594
people who wanted to work in a state

96
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,022
a. Some of them would like to also work

97
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:46,846
in a state b. But there are some people who

98
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:50,160
don't like change, and that's totally okay.

99
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,434
Pretty much every one of us have some difficulties in

100
00:06:54,472 --> 00:06:58,194
changing our habits. So that's why

101
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:03,390
we have the state a transformation

102
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,742
to state B. And this is not just easy,

103
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:08,920
just like saying, hey,

104
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,374
from tomorrow we'll do everything in another way. We need

105
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:17,810
to do it step by step. We need to transform it. So in

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,082
the middle stage, we need CTO have something that we

107
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:24,666
were using before. So on the left hand side, you can

108
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,540
imagine the silos, for example,

109
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,582
like green and red rectangle,

110
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:33,722
corresponds with the two departments working

111
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:37,338
in the silos. And in ideal state in

112
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:40,318
the B state, we would like to have those people working together,

113
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:43,874
development and operations. So in the middle, we need

114
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:47,282
to break the silos a little bit, building trust

115
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:52,382
and having this third component, which is this activities

116
00:07:52,446 --> 00:07:55,842
in the middle that we had this orchestration, deployment activities,

117
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:59,138
container activities and so on, as a shared

118
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:02,470
responsibility between those two departments.

119
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,830
Now, when those people from department Green and department Red

120
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,174
will establish trust, the shared

121
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:14,586
responsibility is possible. So there will be no blaming game,

122
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:18,490
or we would like to eliminate the blaming game. We would like CTO have

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,190
one group responsible for the whole software.

124
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:27,274
And that's actually three steps that Kurt Levin described

125
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:31,290
is unfreeze the organization, change the organization

126
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,618
and freeze. Unfreezing means that

127
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:39,186
saying, hey, we would like to change the ways of working.

128
00:08:39,288 --> 00:08:42,942
We don't want to have silos anymore.

129
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:47,114
We would like to unfreeze it and prepare you to explore

130
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:51,062
the new ways of working. Then in the stage number

131
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:54,914
two, we change the ways of working and then freeze

132
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:58,380
again saying, hey, this is new ways of working. You see the benefits,

133
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,082
you can experiment with that. And that's our strategy moving

134
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,474
forward. So those three steps, this is the

135
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:10,334
Kurt Levin model, as I mentioned. So unfreeze, change and

136
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:15,070
freeze. This is typical behavior of our transformation.

137
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,466
So when we unfreeze, we create climate

138
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:20,400
for change.

139
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,114
We learn how to implement the change.

140
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,322
We teach other people, teach our leaders, we show them that the change is,

141
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:34,350
first things first, important. The second thing is very critical

142
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,182
for our business. And there will be benefits for the organization and

143
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:42,646
personal benefits as well for

144
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:45,750
the people engaged in this stage.

145
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,126
Then we enable the organization. So we provide all the tools

146
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:53,706
that we would like to have, all the knowledge, as I said,

147
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:57,834
all the trainings. We have a lot of one on one discussions with

148
00:09:57,872 --> 00:10:01,454
people, showing them the benefits, explaining them the

149
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:05,198
need for the change. And that's the most critical process,

150
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:09,006
this enabling organization in the middle,

151
00:10:09,188 --> 00:10:12,882
because if you will do it right, people will be ready

152
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:16,878
for this change. And then freezing,

153
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:20,754
meaning sustaining change. So once we

154
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,340
learned new ways of working, once we learned how to

155
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,830
together operate in, for example,

156
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,766
Jenkins, or how to use nagios and other

157
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:35,558
tools, we would like to keep it. We don't want people to

158
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:39,334
come back CTO, the other tool to the old ways of working and

159
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,146
old tools, saying, hey, this nagios is not so good. I would

160
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:46,346
like to use the previous tool I

161
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:50,118
was using, or saying, no, I don't want to be involved in this

162
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:54,640
build pipeline creation, because I'm just operation guy.

163
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,670
We don't want that. We want people, developers and operations working

164
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,966
together. So that change needs to be

165
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:06,306
sustainable and we need to provide environments to keep people

166
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:09,700
satisfied and keep people engaged to

167
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,546
have this change. So that's, this freezing part here

168
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:18,022
is just an example, but I guess that you already

169
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:21,382
are familiar with that, that we have obviously some

170
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:24,806
activities. I'm not calling those

171
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:28,642
phases because we are not in an environment

172
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:31,866
of waterfall anymore. Maybe in

173
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:35,114
some commands we do, but I would like to call it

174
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,298
activities. There is a coding activity, there is a building

175
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:41,866
activity, that we build software, there's an integration part,

176
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:46,894
there's a testing part. We release and software with

177
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:50,574
the corresponding changes and then deploying to production and

178
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:55,140
operating. So this is about first step is CTO have

179
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,374
continuous integration, then continuous delivery,

180
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:03,138
continuous deployment. And DevOps is one step

181
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:07,062
further. So having everything and

182
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:10,870
everyone working alongside together. So that's DevOps.

183
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,150
All right. And our talk today is about clevel view or

184
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,730
CTO view on DevOps transformations, how to

185
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,842
implement the change and how to drive the

186
00:12:24,896 --> 00:12:28,490
change in the organization, how to transform this organization.

187
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,550
The question is, do you really want to know what's the city

188
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,130
of view of DevOps transformation?

189
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,840
I guess you know, you want to know.

190
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,502
First things first. You need to understand that there will be broader

191
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:48,946
context for you. And sometimes it will

192
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,306
be difficult to have this context because we, as a

193
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:56,574
specialist, as engineers, we are very

194
00:12:56,632 --> 00:13:00,018
narrow in the focus. We have deep knowledge.

195
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:03,174
That's our advantage. That's how we earn for living.

196
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:06,438
We have very deep knowledge, technical knowledge, but our focus

197
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:10,790
and view is limited. And generalists

198
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,682
have a zoom out and have a broader view. They don't have any more.

199
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:17,754
So deep knowledge, that's why they hire you guys.

200
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:20,878
But they have the broader view on the context of the business,

201
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:23,658
of the environment, of the structure of the organization.

202
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:27,962
So that's the visualization.

203
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:31,486
I would like to show it to you, by the

204
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:36,074
way, I would like CTO recommend to follow this guy. He's very

205
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:39,442
great designer and provides designs such

206
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:42,914
like this. So I like CTo be inspired by

207
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:46,534
this guy. All right.

208
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:50,418
Talking about our activity, daily activities,

209
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:53,986
programming version, controlling deployment and so on and so forth.

210
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:57,506
What we've already discussed, that's huge part of

211
00:13:57,548 --> 00:14:01,500
our life, that's huge part of our knowledge and our experience.

212
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,454
And at the same time we call it DevOps.

213
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:10,554
Right as I greet. But this is just part of

214
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:13,450
the organization. This is not a core of the organization.

215
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,574
Obviously, it might be a core, but this

216
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:20,510
is very small part of what's going on in our organization.

217
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,554
So we have DevOps activities, we have

218
00:14:25,592 --> 00:14:29,470
agile activities that I'm not here to talk about agile,

219
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,234
but I also specialized in agile ways

220
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:36,546
of working, and it goes hand to hand

221
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:39,830
with DevOps. So we have DevOps and agile practices,

222
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,606
and that's about collaboration, about tools as

223
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:47,814
well. Agile is also about tools sometimes, but in

224
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:52,010
general, it's how we collaborate together, developers, operations guys and

225
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,570
product guys in the agile environment.

226
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,634
Right? So that's collaboration. And then in the whole organization we

227
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:04,494
have structure, as I said. So CTO guys need

228
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:08,074
to think with other CE level people about the structure

229
00:15:08,122 --> 00:15:10,880
of the company, how we will be working together.

230
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,490
So that's the structure. With whom, how and with whom,

231
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,154
what will be the structure of our teams, what will be the structure of

232
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:25,050
our departments, how CTO break the silos and so on and so forth.

233
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,062
Then there is a strategy. This is more about how actually

234
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:33,234
the strategy is with whom, how collaborate,

235
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:37,000
but how to deliver software. How about our technology?

236
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,666
We'll be using Java or net. Are we going to go CTO,

237
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:45,062
the microservices oriented architecture and so on. So the strategy,

238
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:49,062
technological strategy for ctos and the business strategy

239
00:15:49,126 --> 00:15:52,198
for executives, for CEO,

240
00:15:52,374 --> 00:15:56,670
how to earn money for the whole company, for the whole business, to provide

241
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,286
you jobs, right? So that's the strategy piece.

242
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:03,842
And then there is the last but not least organizational behavior piece.

243
00:16:03,976 --> 00:16:08,066
So what we will be doing here in

244
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:11,442
the meaning maybe not even about the product, but how

245
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:14,750
to behave in our organization, what are the norms,

246
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,958
what are the standards, what is our culture in

247
00:16:19,964 --> 00:16:23,094
this environment, what is our language that we speak, for example,

248
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:27,014
that's a lot of different activities. So that's in

249
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,630
general broad picture of the whole organization.

250
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,540
So you can see that your technology part even is

251
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,980
key in the organization, is just part of it.

252
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,814
And the organization is going through change.

253
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:46,542
So we need to transform this organization from

254
00:16:46,596 --> 00:16:50,398
state a to state b, if you remember. So all the people,

255
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:54,146
all the topics, all the aspects that we have already talked about need

256
00:16:54,168 --> 00:16:59,860
to be transformed, need to change

257
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,290
and have this way ahead of the organization.

258
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,478
Actually, I see the two ways or two

259
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:12,786
buses, if I call it that way, the mindset

260
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:16,706
bus and the technology bus. We already talked a little bit about the mindset

261
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:20,186
of technology, right? So we need to change the technology and

262
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:24,026
we need CTO change our ways of thinking and ways of working.

263
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,562
So that's how our organization is going through the

264
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:31,118
transformation. We need to transform technology. At the same time, we need

265
00:17:31,124 --> 00:17:34,142
to transform our mindset, ways of thinking

266
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:37,646
about ourselves. So looking again about the

267
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:41,886
structure, we can see the

268
00:17:41,988 --> 00:17:45,534
interactions that's up there. There's interaction

269
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:49,266
between mindset bus and technology

270
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,054
bus. I guess that some of you already recognize

271
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:56,998
this pattern and this analogy to our computer

272
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:01,234
architecture. So if we think about organizational

273
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:04,614
behavior, this is an input to our mindset. So how

274
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:08,318
we will be behaving, what do we accept or what don't

275
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:12,006
we accept? If operations guys will be blaming developers

276
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:15,050
and developers will be blaming operations,

277
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,034
are we okay to accept that? Or we will say, no,

278
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:21,970
this is not our norm, we don't accept this rule.

279
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,974
We accept no blaming culture, for example.

280
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:29,070
So that's the input to mindset bus. But when it comes to strategy,

281
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,726
actually, when I was thinking about that, there are actually inputs, CTO, our mindset

282
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:37,282
bus and the technology bus, because it's about which

283
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:39,860
technology we will use and how to use it.

284
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,906
But also, this is about how to approach this technology

285
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:48,182
and what are our ways

286
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:51,080
of working together alongside with this technology.

287
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,110
If we have, for example, microservices oriented architecture,

288
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,034
how our teams will be speaking together, or even

289
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:02,330
more. And that's the next bit, the structure.

290
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,490
So this is the analogy for me to the memory,

291
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,134
the organizational memory, how we'll structure our

292
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,694
teams in order to make sure that the knowledge will

293
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:17,280
be stored in our organization and the

294
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,966
experience that we have in building. For example, microservices will

295
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:25,538
be stored in the teams, rather than just pulling people

296
00:19:25,624 --> 00:19:29,058
to projects and dispatching them after the project.

297
00:19:29,224 --> 00:19:33,202
So that's about structure. And at the end of the day, cpu is

298
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:37,142
our collaboration. So we have our

299
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:40,280
cpu here, right? Every single one of us.

300
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,658
But in the organization, there is collective cpu.

301
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:48,460
That's why organizations are getting bigger and bigger, because they need,

302
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:55,626
sometimes we call it brain power. They need the brain power to

303
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:59,130
think through solutions, to design the products.

304
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,082
So we need to collaborate together. More precisely, our brains

305
00:20:03,146 --> 00:20:07,550
need to collaborate together to

306
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,438
produce the outcome. So that's how it works

307
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:15,186
and how it looks. And then there is

308
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:19,090
a trust that needs to be established.

309
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,054
And the technology bus, for me, it's cognitive aspect

310
00:20:23,102 --> 00:20:27,080
of trust. So we need CTO know that

311
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,562
this person will deliver the solution,

312
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:34,902
that he or she has the knowledge, he or she has the experience,

313
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:39,430
and will prove that is able to deliver the software,

314
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,494
and then will trust this person. And also CTO

315
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:49,066
will trust this person and vice versa. If CTO have

316
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:50,330
to have some knowledge,

317
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,534
people needs to trust him or her, that she or

318
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:59,150
he will deliver the idea that

319
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,074
the strategy, technological strategy. And there is another aspect of

320
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:07,150
trust, emotional aspect of trust. And this is about more about the mindset,

321
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,498
how we approach other people,

322
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:13,860
collaboration with other people. Do we trust them?

323
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,894
If we are open with them, if we are honest with them,

324
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:22,342
we don't hide ourselves or keep a secrets. We are ready

325
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:26,242
to cooperate. That's emotional aspect of trust. So those two buses,

326
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:29,320
for me, is also about building a trust,

327
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,322
cognitive aspect of trust and emotional aspect of trust.

328
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:36,506
I don't have time today to talk more about building trust,

329
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:40,394
but as an engineers, trust for me was a little bit fuzzy

330
00:21:40,442 --> 00:21:44,000
word. So I dig into the details and

331
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,478
created a special talk about trust. If you

332
00:21:48,484 --> 00:21:51,946
are interested, I think there are some talks

333
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:55,586
out there online you can reach out

334
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:56,820
to and listen.

335
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,166
There's one effect connected with trust, the iceberg

336
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:07,474
of the ignorance. This effect tells

337
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:11,590
us that ceos or

338
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,058
clevel guys know just a little bit about the troubles

339
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:18,406
in the organization. They measure that this is

340
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:21,994
just about 4%. They know about just 4% of the problems.

341
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:25,386
Why is that? Because of the erosion of

342
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:28,794
trust. That 100% of problems are

343
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:31,854
known for people in the teams. Right. You know,

344
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,838
guys, what's going well, what's not going well. And sometimes

345
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:40,654
you share with your manager, if you have better trust with

346
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,506
him or her, you share more. If not,

347
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:47,186
you hide some problems. Right. Sometimes we

348
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:50,450
are afraid of talking about problems. So that's the challenge,

349
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,534
and it's going on. Right. So, to remove those

350
00:22:56,572 --> 00:23:00,646
barriers, we need to build a trust to

351
00:23:00,668 --> 00:23:04,658
bubble up the problems, not to be blamed by our CTO. We don't

352
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:10,426
want to be blamed. Right. But to solve that

353
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:14,534
problems. Okay. So now, looking from the CTO

354
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:17,850
perspective, what are their needs and what are the biases?

355
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,814
They have some needs, and sometimes the conversation

356
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:25,742
with CTO can be tough. I know, and clevel

357
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:28,974
guys, but this is because they have some

358
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:32,990
needs, personal needs, as all of us, and they have some biases

359
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,690
as well. So today, I would like to tell you something

360
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,770
about that for you to understand more. Clevel executives.

361
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,338
It is about needs.

362
00:23:44,504 --> 00:23:47,830
Based on the Marshall Rosenberg research and

363
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,366
biases, notation is about this organization that I put

364
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,742
the link here. You can check. There are more

365
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:58,250
than 100 biases over there that people are biased.

366
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,460
And I chose the most suitable one for sea level guys.

367
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,706
So I divided into four sections as

368
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:12,006
we talked about organizational behavior, strategy, structure, the collaboration.

369
00:24:12,198 --> 00:24:16,158
When it comes to behaviors, sea level guys

370
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:20,030
have a need of presence, of your presence.

371
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,010
They need to see the people that are engaged,

372
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,750
that are ready to support ctos,

373
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,866
and they are ready to build the trust with CTO, even though

374
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:36,214
there are sometimes tough conversation. CTO need

375
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:40,518
to build trust with you, and you need to build trust with CTO, so they

376
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,958
need your support. That's basically

377
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:48,394
it sometimes it's challenging. And why it's challenging because there are

378
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:52,186
some biases that CTO guys can be

379
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:55,894
led by. The first one is choice supporting

380
00:24:55,942 --> 00:25:00,086
bias, seeing previous choices as a good. Let's imagine the situation when

381
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:04,542
you have new CTO coming into your organization, and she

382
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:08,014
was seeing good options and good

383
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:12,190
solutions in the previous company. So she will be probably

384
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,130
bringing these ideas to the table and seeing,

385
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,794
hey, it was good because previously I did that, it worked.

386
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:23,934
But right now there is a different organization or different structure

387
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,894
or different business environment. So that

388
00:25:28,012 --> 00:25:31,730
is one bias, the other one is a conservatism bias.

389
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:35,334
As simple as it sounds, prefers PI or evidence over

390
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:38,614
the new information. So basically, sea level guys,

391
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:41,938
they are searching for evidence

392
00:25:42,034 --> 00:25:45,386
in the data. So if they have the

393
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:47,500
evidence that something worked,

394
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,670
they prefer doing that way, rather than seeing

395
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,430
new solutions, new architectures and so on.

396
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,094
Obviously, ctos are more open to new

397
00:26:00,132 --> 00:26:03,758
architecture and new technological stuff. But in general, clevel guys,

398
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:06,580
they may be conservative in that type.

399
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,574
Confirmation bias, seeking information to keep our internal

400
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:15,338
judgment. So if you would like to implement

401
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,626
microservices or go to AWS, we seek

402
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:21,954
only about that. Everyone is going to aws

403
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:26,114
and so amazing. But we may forget

404
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:29,942
about difficulties in the structure

405
00:26:30,086 --> 00:26:33,942
piece. They are achievers, most likely

406
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:37,174
sea level guys. They are achievers, meaning they would like to achieve

407
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,746
something. They would like to discover. This is strategy in

408
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:44,046
a structure. So they would like to achieve something. They would like

409
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:47,626
to discover something. So they would like to build a strategy

410
00:26:47,658 --> 00:26:51,450
to achieve and discover new horizons.

411
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,860
Right? And they would like to also know that

412
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,982
we know where we are heading to them as a CTO.

413
00:27:00,046 --> 00:27:04,094
So they YC level guys produce strategy piece and roadmap

414
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:07,350
and so on. But I would like to also understand that you know

415
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,430
where you are heading to. And there are also

416
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,286
three. By assisted I

417
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,774
found impact overestimating of things because of its potential

418
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:22,886
impact. If we see potential impact

419
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:27,290
that they may have on the revenue, for example, we overestimate

420
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,758
the implementation of microservices, of getting

421
00:27:31,844 --> 00:27:34,990
rid of our servers and moving to AWS.

422
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,938
Ostrich does. The funny name ostrich

423
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:41,680
by us is ignoring dangerous information, obviously.

424
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,246
So focusing just on solutions

425
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,794
that worked and with

426
00:27:51,832 --> 00:27:55,650
a happy path. Obviously there's not that way that all ctos

427
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,110
will be forgetting about ignoring that dangerous information.

428
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,994
But that's the bias that can be dragged

429
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:07,160
into and overconfidence. That's very

430
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,934
frequent bias. Being too confident about our abilities,

431
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:14,506
too confident about moving to AWS in a year or

432
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:18,140
so. In the structure piece,

433
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,570
they seek consistency, stability, and clarity.

434
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,962
So they would like to have consistent structure in the organization,

435
00:28:26,106 --> 00:28:29,406
stable structure in the organization, and clear

436
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:33,006
structure in the organization. That's why when you

437
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:36,402
have new executives coming in, they would like to make

438
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:39,460
this organization as efficient as possible for them.

439
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,374
And the biases that they can have at this stage. Clustering,

440
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:47,286
isolation, seeing patterns where there are no patterns. I had one

441
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,866
advice from my colleague. We had totally

442
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:54,006
two different departments, but just one word in the

443
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:57,346
name was the same. I don't remember even the word, but let's

444
00:28:57,378 --> 00:29:00,262
put it strategic projects.

445
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,674
And one department, let's use that name.

446
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:07,366
One department was totally technical strategic projects development,

447
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:11,710
and the other was strategic projects project management.

448
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,806
And this person saw just strategic projects and

449
00:29:15,828 --> 00:29:19,194
say, hey, we need to merge those two teams, right? Because it's

450
00:29:19,242 --> 00:29:22,486
just strategic projects. So be aware

451
00:29:22,538 --> 00:29:25,986
of this vividness. Focus on

452
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:28,820
the most easily recognizable data. So, again,

453
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,838
looking at the data, but focusing, you need to understand that ctos

454
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:37,880
have a lot of distractions and a lot of information they need to

455
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:42,678
have in their heads. So they seek for

456
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:46,098
clarity. And if they recognize the data patterns,

457
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:49,770
they will go under this one, even though the data

458
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,218
might be not correct,

459
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:56,442
framing, being influenced by the situation, is how the situation is

460
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:59,986
presented. That's the aspect of elevator pitch,

461
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:03,950
right? That we remember some examples in

462
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:07,886
Silicon Valley of the elevator pitches that were not so, that the

463
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:11,680
businesses were not so profitable, but the elevator pitches were so great.

464
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:18,866
So that's why we

465
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:22,322
need to avoid this bias. And the last one,

466
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:25,374
collaboration, group empowerment,

467
00:30:25,502 --> 00:30:29,362
inspiration and situation and contribution and belonging.

468
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:33,046
So when CTO asks you to come to the office, because they have the

469
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:36,678
workshop for you, they seek inspiration from you,

470
00:30:36,764 --> 00:30:40,582
they seek stimulation that you will ask questions to CTO,

471
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:44,300
you will collaborate, contribute, you will

472
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,646
be empowered group to inspire CTO, because CTO

473
00:30:48,678 --> 00:30:52,646
is not just one person sitting somewhere and judging.

474
00:30:52,758 --> 00:30:56,778
He or she would like to speak with you, and that's also about belonging.

475
00:30:56,954 --> 00:31:00,640
He or she would like to belong to the group, because sometimes

476
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,040
he or she is perceived as a person somewhere else in the board,

477
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,026
and he or she may feel alone. So he

478
00:31:09,048 --> 00:31:12,450
or she would like to belong to the group on the workshop, for example.

479
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,640
That's why people ask about coming to the office.

480
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:20,210
And the biases at this stage, mirror imaging,

481
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,558
assuming others will act the same as we would like to

482
00:31:23,644 --> 00:31:27,206
or as we would act. This is more

483
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:31,066
in the group, right? False consensus, overestimation of

484
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:34,874
consensus within the group. If we don't have a trust and we are afraid of

485
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,940
conflict. Sometimes not so frequent, but sometimes

486
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,862
the discussions that should have happened will not be happening because of the

487
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:48,606
lack of trust and fear group thinking.

488
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:52,126
Choosing the option that majority of the group prefers, even though it's not the

489
00:31:52,148 --> 00:31:55,486
best option. That sometimes that can happen even

490
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:59,634
in the executive team itself when more like

491
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:04,274
say, hey, we have six executives and five of them are

492
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:07,606
into one solution. But just CTO is seeing different point

493
00:32:07,628 --> 00:32:10,898
of view. But it's difficult. CTO challenge

494
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:14,914
those five people and hello effect agreeing and disagreeing

495
00:32:14,962 --> 00:32:18,166
with someone because of his or

496
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:21,562
her personality. If we are inspired by someone, we can also

497
00:32:21,616 --> 00:32:24,890
be biased.

498
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,714
All right, so at the end, in a couple of minutes I would like to

499
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:32,670
give you a pro tips how to show up

500
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,790
in front of the sea level guys in front of the CTO.

501
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,630
Be docker but not this docker.

502
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,194
Be a container that have

503
00:32:44,232 --> 00:32:47,410
a lot of information inside of you and can

504
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,406
ship those information to your CTO. Also organization

505
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:55,186
can be this container and the

506
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:58,454
transformation is very slow because

507
00:32:58,492 --> 00:33:02,278
this container moves very slow. So you need to

508
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:05,350
be bond, James Bond.

509
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,450
Basically you need to be the person go to person for special

510
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,378
tasks. If your CTO trusts you and say, hey,

511
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:15,820
this, I don't know. Mike. Mike will

512
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,060
deal with that definitely. You will

513
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:24,960
win trust in the CTO and you will win

514
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,614
in the organization. Build trust within the crew and

515
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:33,074
the skipper. So build trust between your team and

516
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:36,274
CTO. Not having a blame game,

517
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:41,700
we have bad CTO and so on. Even though team

518
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,574
have this narration. Build trust with them, try to bring

519
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:49,670
them together. Know your coordinates

520
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,446
so create a map roadmap for

521
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:56,694
your team. Measure where you are.

522
00:33:56,892 --> 00:34:00,634
Inspect and adapt. If you can improve something and

523
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:04,134
have alternative road meaning. Have alternative solutions.

524
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:07,754
If this solution will not happen, keep a full

525
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:11,870
steam, have the energy be energized and motivated

526
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,622
to help your CTO because CTO seeks for people

527
00:34:16,676 --> 00:34:20,510
who will help him or her moving this organization.

528
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:25,170
Don't wait in the port, just be brave and be vocal.

529
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,246
Ask for meetings with your CTO and propose your solutions

530
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,802
and drive a tagboat. Not sure if you know what the tagboat is that those

531
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:36,338
small boats that moves those bigger

532
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:39,720
containers, bigger ships in the port.

533
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,550
Small tugboats can move huge ship.

534
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,950
With this tagboat you can stabilize the ship. You can normalize

535
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,730
the tech stack. Help your CTO

536
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,014
be involved in the technology in a typical technology discussion

537
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:00,618
as well. But also know your limitations of

538
00:35:00,624 --> 00:35:04,810
your technology and don't just focus on AWS because this is AWS.

539
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,730
Know your limitations and speak with your CTO about hey, this is good solution

540
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,622
but you need to watch out for this and this and that and

541
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:17,090
look behind the horizon. This is the most important point

542
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,674
for our technology people, engineers. We need to look

543
00:35:20,712 --> 00:35:24,082
behind the horizon of the business side. We are not just

544
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:27,510
here to code, we are just here to grow the organization.

545
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:31,846
So be the captain in your team. Drive the

546
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:35,190
group towards new destination. This is something

547
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,818
that CTO and CW guys seeks in engineers.

548
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:42,360
Not just coding, but thinking about the whole business

549
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,960
and thinking about other ships. So other companies,

550
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,738
if they can do what they do and how they achieve

551
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:57,502
results in the organization at the end.

552
00:35:57,556 --> 00:36:01,454
I would like to leave you with this quotation. The wind and

553
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:05,630
the waves are always on the same side of the ables navigator.

554
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,134
So be brave and thank you very much.

555
00:36:09,252 --> 00:36:11,614
It was a pleasure to speaking with you today.

556
00:36:11,812 --> 00:36:12,410
Cheers.
