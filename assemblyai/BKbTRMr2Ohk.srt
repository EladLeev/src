00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,490
and observing changes exceptions.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,666
Errors in real time allows you to not only experiment with confidence,

5
00:00:16,778 --> 00:00:20,480
but respond instantly to get things working again.

00:00:24,610 --> 00:01:06,614
Close SAK

7
00:01:06,682 --> 00:01:11,118
about application application for blockchain in crowdsourcing

8
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:14,722
data what are the problems in data

9
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:18,854
sourcing? The world is Chainlink around all

10
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:21,938
the time. Companies formed,

11
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:26,150
others become smaller and go bankrupt.

12
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,100
New technologies come to light,

13
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,966
governments come into power either through democratic

14
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:36,934
means or otherwise, and government policies

15
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:40,638
are changing all the time. We live

16
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:45,230
in a very turbulent time right now due to coronavirus

17
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,790
and the conflict in Ukraine.

18
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,630
Things that we thought were going to stay

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,506
the same are changing in a rapid and

20
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:58,862
massive way. New data sources

21
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:02,580
are coming online and evolving all the time

22
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,270
due to Chainlink world, we have more and more data

23
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,158
that's becoming available, just difficult to keep up.

24
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:15,442
The amount of data is growing massively. 2.5 quintillion

25
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:18,620
bytes I've generated every day.

26
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,700
Also, each data source has its own design,

27
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,930
some format or language, and its culture

28
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,582
that is embedded in might be different,

29
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:36,158
it might be working in different laws, require different relations

30
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:39,760
that can be very hard to keep up.

31
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,018
All this change seems to be on a massive amount

32
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:47,502
affecting the world. Some data sources

33
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:50,686
are resistant to quantification. Scientists,

34
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:54,306
engineers, analysts love the data that

35
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:56,950
is uniform and quantifiable,

36
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,630
is easy to enrich and transform.

37
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,886
They love standard data formats as they're important.

38
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,666
For example, when calculating inflation, you need

39
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,298
to know what category particular product is in,

40
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:15,850
how to convert units into a standard format,

41
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,946
and what currency it is measured in.

42
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,546
If you are the scale of Google, everyone will try to serve

43
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,150
you. It is different if you are at scale of a startup.

44
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,974
Large established corporation such as Google has

45
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:34,580
a massive scale and near monopoly grip on the web,

46
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,178
which means everybody's trying to serve them.

47
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,390
Everybody's trying to adapt their websites,

48
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,734
make it easier for Google algorithm to extract

49
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:48,662
the data and to rank the website higher than

50
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:52,214
their competitors. Everyone is trying to

51
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:55,718
produce content that is suitable for

52
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:59,206
the Google algorithm. However, if you

53
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:03,354
are a small startup, your challenges are going to be much different.

54
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:07,226
Nobody is going to care to transform the data for you.

55
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:11,994
That means this is going to be your own responsibility. Your resources

56
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,550
are limited, so your challenge is to do it

57
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,310
at any scale.

58
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,010
So what are the advantages of

59
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,250
crowdsourcing data collection?

60
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,062
Naturally, the first advantage is that you can scale

61
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:33,870
it up easily. As long as you can incentivize

62
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,160
the crowd to contribute your project.

63
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,098
The number of data collectors and analysts can be nearly

64
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:46,230
limitless. This is like a

65
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,214
cloud service provider for computing or storage

66
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:54,106
services can also discover new

67
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,890
means to defeat data quantification.

68
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,914
A lot of organizations have data silos.

69
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:04,686
They do not want to necessarily make them available because it

70
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,470
can reduce their competitive advantage.

71
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,294
However, to interact with individuals such as

72
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:14,722
their customers, they do have share small

73
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:20,194
parts of that data set. At least some

74
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:24,510
have implemented automated data scraping protection, which is curious

75
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,326
considering decades ago Google started doing

76
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,360
scraping without much permission. There was no such thing.

77
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,454
These days everybody knows that Google brings customers

78
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:40,314
over. However, for others, data access

79
00:05:40,432 --> 00:05:45,130
is often restricted to protect their competitive advantage

80
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,980
while crowdsourcing this data.

81
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,154
This type of protection can be defeated on several

82
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:55,358
levels because there is no way to share your data

83
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:58,720
with the customer while protecting it as well.

84
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,706
Another approach for an organization can

85
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:06,286
take is by rapidly modifying their user

86
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:09,950
interface so they can change up where things appear

87
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,570
to change, how they look, how they are presented.

88
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,178
However, when dealing with a crowd, this protection is no longer viable

89
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:21,542
because an individual can always understand and

90
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:25,170
help quantify it into an easily understandable

91
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,146
format. Sometimes, however, data is also

92
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:32,842
made available to others through APIs and

93
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:36,538
interfaces. However, due to large number of different

94
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:40,670
interfaces and lack of standards, it can be difficult

95
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,414
to have resources to integrate them and this is where

96
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:47,934
crowdsourcing data can also help. It can

97
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:51,370
also enable data analysis on a scale

98
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,810
and depth that is not viable for a small organization.

99
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,634
After gathering raw data, it is important to

100
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:02,862
perform analysis convert it into useful

101
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:06,530
knowledge. Raw data is only as valuable

102
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,110
as much as you can analyze and obtain insights.

103
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,106
A smaller organization can have difficulty

104
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:18,566
performing a wealth of different types of analysis

105
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:21,914
because for each analysis you might need

106
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:26,774
a different skill set. You might need a different type of expert

107
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:30,618
which can be very expensive to either contract them

108
00:07:30,704 --> 00:07:34,302
for a short time at a high rate, or to have

109
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:38,014
somebody permanent which takes time to train and

110
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:40,990
incorporate into an organization.

111
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,954
But you can also crowdsource analysis if you provide an

112
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:50,034
incentive. It means that the expert can perform

113
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:53,586
a small step toward achieving a result

114
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:58,886
and you can share whatever benefits from the analysis with

115
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:02,694
the person to incentivisation them. This means you

116
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,482
don't necessarily have to come up with sufficient capital

117
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:10,514
in advance to contract

118
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:14,374
the expert. You can also collect data from online

119
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:18,086
and offline sources. A lot of the data is online

120
00:08:18,188 --> 00:08:20,960
and more and more of it comes available.

121
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,450
However, no matter how effective the collection

122
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,520
and upload means are,

123
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,982
there still is always more information

124
00:08:32,116 --> 00:08:35,982
available. Offline data is also available offline

125
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:39,218
first, therefore before it

126
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:43,502
can be become online. When crowdsourcing

127
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:47,462
the data, you can use the crowd wisdom to

128
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:51,442
note offline events and incentivisation

129
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:54,902
the crowd to share those events as

130
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:59,078
they happen this way to enable functionality

131
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:02,986
that is more rapidly done than without

132
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:06,874
a crowd. What are the

133
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:10,714
differences between centralized and decentralized

134
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:14,382
systems? Centralized systems can be less

135
00:09:14,436 --> 00:09:17,440
complicated to build and to control.

136
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,706
However, they are opaque. They are not tolerant

137
00:09:21,818 --> 00:09:25,970
to attacks and can be less secure.

138
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,886
They can be less scalable and have a central

139
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,694
point of failure, at least the organization that created

140
00:09:33,742 --> 00:09:37,670
them. Decentralized based systems

141
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,006
can be more scalable and fault tolerant can

142
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:46,546
be more secure. As all nodes are treated fairly,

143
00:09:46,738 --> 00:09:50,410
it eliminates the need for intermediaries

144
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,530
and is more transparent.

145
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,610
So how decentralized are blockchain?

146
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,840
There is no such thing as a perfectly decentralized system.

147
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,174
Nakamoto coefficient was invented to attempt to

148
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:11,802
quantify the level of decentralization of a blockchain

149
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:15,882
system. It takes into account various parameters

150
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:20,080
such as how many active wallets are there, how many developers are there,

151
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,000
how many nodes active, and so on.

152
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,698
It might not be a perfect measure

153
00:10:27,874 --> 00:10:31,586
because bitcoin has three large mining

154
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:34,866
pools that in principle could coordinate what's

155
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:38,838
called a 51% attack. However, its Nakamoto

156
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:42,586
coefficient is the highest. An attack like that would result

157
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:46,026
in bitcoin's price dropping and the

158
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:49,690
value of their mining work being reduced, and as such,

159
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
there is no incentive to do so.

160
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,442
What is a blockchain? A blockchain is a decentralized

161
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:01,998
ledger which is implemented as a

162
00:11:02,004 --> 00:11:05,842
series of blocks. Each block contains a number

163
00:11:05,896 --> 00:11:09,406
of transactions and refers to the previous block

164
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:13,122
and its hash. This ensures that the order of

165
00:11:13,176 --> 00:11:15,750
transactions can always be verified.

166
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,002
Modern blockchains also support having smart

167
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:23,922
contracts, which can run code based on the conditions

168
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:27,946
in the blockchain and can interact with the outside

169
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:31,530
world through interfaces called oracles.

170
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,514
For example, you could set up a smart contract that

171
00:11:35,552 --> 00:11:39,338
pays somebody cryptocurrency into their account every

172
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:42,110
month, like a loan.

173
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,586
Or you could set up a system where people play roulette

174
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:50,686
and this would be more transparent than a traditional casino website,

175
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:54,130
as you could verify everything on the blockchain.

176
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,950
Blockchain also can incorporate

177
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,794
actual legal contracts with people that are

178
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:06,050
called ricardian contract. However, this is largely

179
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,200
unrecognized to date.

180
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,806
Blockchain requires a consensus algorithm to

181
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:18,438
make sure that we know which data is valid.

182
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:22,182
For example, bitcoin is using longest

183
00:12:22,246 --> 00:12:26,250
chain consensus, which means that everybody

184
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,754
is trying to build on the longest chain to make

185
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,790
sure their work is included.

186
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,746
Bitcoin is using a proof of work consensus mechanism,

187
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:39,390
which is very energy intensive.

188
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,474
Alternative consensus mechanisms such as

189
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,426
proof of stake have been implemented to solve that problem.

190
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:51,410
On other blockchains such as cardano.

191
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,990
What is blockchain good at? It is good

192
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,766
at incentivizing people. It means by

193
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:03,718
giving them something of value, often of monetary value.

194
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:07,270
By providing small incentives for actions done

195
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,146
on the blockchain, you can encourage people to work

196
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,574
together with you. A lot of cryptocurrencies

197
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:19,050
used on the blockchain are deflationary,

198
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,814
which means over time they appreciate in value.

199
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:26,590
That can be a powerful long term incentive for

200
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,710
some investors of sweat equity.

201
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,494
It is good at determining the order of things.

202
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:37,962
As blockchain. All transactions

203
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,810
in a block have to be ordered. It is easy

204
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,300
to determine if someone, for example,

205
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,366
provided a piece of information before somebody else,

206
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:55,126
and to make sure the first person to do so gets a

207
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:58,794
reward. It is good at anonymity or

208
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:02,982
pseudonymity, as most blockchains are pseudonymous,

209
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:06,554
which means that you do not know who owns our

210
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:10,206
particular wallet. But normally you can track the

211
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:12,720
transactions from one address to another.

212
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,880
Can also preserve anonymity by, for example,

213
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,666
generating a new address for each transaction.

214
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:24,786
It is good at artificial scarcity. It is a

215
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:27,634
way where you can make something scarce by design.

216
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:31,422
For example, bitcoin has a limited supply and therefore,

217
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:35,478
as demand goes up, the price of bitcoin is going

218
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:40,120
up as well. It is easy to make a token that

219
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,600
is artificial cars on blockchain and

220
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,570
you can also create nonfungible tokens which

221
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,314
represent unique things like pieces of art,

222
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:54,570
digital or otherwise.

223
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,940
It is also good at decentralization as

224
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,694
it can easily scale. If the incentives are set

225
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:07,454
up right, the number of nodes can increase as

226
00:15:07,492 --> 00:15:11,614
the demand for the network increases. What is

227
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:14,818
blockchain lacking at? It is difficult

228
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:19,170
to store large amounts of data on the blockchain because

229
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,834
each copy of the data needs to be available on

230
00:15:22,872 --> 00:15:26,470
every node that is participating in the network.

231
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,234
There are attempts to solve this, and some blockchains, such as filecoin,

232
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:35,160
are storing large amounts of data

233
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,542
also to enable queries of the data is not yet

234
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:43,610
a fully solved problem, and that a lot of blockchains are

235
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,878
integrating with centralized systems for the storage

236
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:52,190
of data. You can also not make

237
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,270
data changes easily as each

238
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,670
change is preserved, and as such is costly.

239
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,418
The trilemma of blockchain challenges

240
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:08,670
has been described by Vitalik Butler,

241
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,714
the founder of deuterium. It means that from three

242
00:16:13,752 --> 00:16:16,982
parameters, decentralized, scalable and

243
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,880
secure, you can only have two.

244
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,734
Multiple blockchains have made attempts to solve it,

245
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:28,186
or at least find a workable middle ground. For example,

246
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:31,914
Polkadot has a small number of validator nodes that are

247
00:16:31,952 --> 00:16:35,914
elected and such can be very fast but

248
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:38,150
is not very centralized.

249
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,606
Decentralized application

250
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:46,730
application application application application application

251
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,710
for blockchain in crowdsourcing data blockchain to obtain

252
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:56,146
the data first, we can

253
00:16:56,168 --> 00:17:00,050
incentivize people by providing them with a token that

254
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,906
ideally would appreciate in value over time,

255
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,974
so they would be interested in investing their time and effort so

256
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:12,002
they can obtain more of this token. Also, the blockchain

257
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:16,194
ensures the security of this reward and enables

258
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:19,130
trading it in for money if necessary.

259
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,660
We can determine who owns what piece of work.

260
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,074
We can use blockchain to determine who has performed what

261
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:32,190
work or provided what data first. This can enable people

262
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,426
to easily obtain proof and therefore

263
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:40,782
incentivize people who are pioneering a particular type

264
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:45,010
of tasks we can enable on chain governance

265
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,990
blockchain is a good means of blockchain governance

266
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,310
as you prove who owns a particular number of votes

267
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,834
and the only drawback is that blockchain voting

268
00:17:56,882 --> 00:18:01,202
is currently public only. So to implement private

269
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:04,866
voting you would need to have new technologies

270
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,430
such as zero knowledge proofs.

271
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,026
Distributed autonomous organizations have been

272
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:16,054
around for a while now and are using on chain

273
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:20,730
governance for disrupting the work of executives.

274
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,842
Choosing a Blockchain Ethereum

275
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:30,442
was the first blockchain to implement

276
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:34,306
smart contracts functionality on a

277
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:38,226
blockchain. Its founder Vitalik actually tried to

278
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:41,378
implement smart contracts on bitcoin first,

279
00:18:41,544 --> 00:18:45,414
but his everports were rejected and as such

280
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:49,186
he created his own blockchain. Ethereum is the oldest

281
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,866
one and has the best community documentation

282
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:56,918
and infrastructure to be able to learn more about

283
00:18:57,004 --> 00:19:00,582
programming blockchain. It uses solidity

284
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:05,350
language as a standard for most other blockchains.

285
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,274
The drawback of this blockchain? That it is very expensive to make

286
00:19:09,312 --> 00:19:13,466
transactions on it due to scalability challenges.

287
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:17,342
There are hopes that the next version of Ethereum is going to address these

288
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:20,800
issues, but this has been promised for a while.

289
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,382
Sushiswap is the most popular distributed exchange

290
00:19:26,446 --> 00:19:29,650
on ethereum. Ethereum is also the most

291
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,490
popular platform for non fungible tokens.

292
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,614
Binance Smart chain is a fork of

293
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:42,294
Ethereum has much lower fees, however it's much

294
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:46,182
more transcendralized as it relies on nodes that are

295
00:19:46,236 --> 00:19:49,770
run by Binance. A lot of projects use

296
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,722
binance due to its low fees and it

297
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,098
trade on decentralized exchanges such as

298
00:19:57,184 --> 00:20:00,346
pancake swap. Solana is

299
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:03,934
one of the fastest blockchains and very popular one

300
00:20:03,972 --> 00:20:07,914
as well has a very high transaction per second rate compared

301
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:12,218
to others. However, because of its speed and low cost

302
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:16,082
has been attacked and taken down several times by

303
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,530
denial of service attacks.

304
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,562
Cardano is my favorite blockchain because it takes

305
00:20:22,616 --> 00:20:26,066
a different approach towards development. They aim

306
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:30,070
to write academic papers first and only

307
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,390
develop code after the papers are reviewed.

308
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,322
They also employ mathematical proofs to make sure that they

309
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:42,540
have a good quality of their code

310
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,450
compared to other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.

311
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,514
As a result, it is very safe blockchain

312
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:55,054
with no known exploits to date because

313
00:20:55,092 --> 00:20:58,494
of this approach, however, they have been recently dealing with

314
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:02,266
some congestion problems after the first popular

315
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:06,266
decentralized exchange has been launched on Cardano

316
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,842
called Pancake Swap. This has been

317
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:13,762
somewhat improved with tweaking the parameters and

318
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:17,794
hopefully will be improved later with further scalability

319
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:22,738
advancements such as sharding Filecoin

320
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:26,134
is a good blockchain to store a lot of data.

321
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:30,490
It is somewhat similar to s three buckets on AWS.

322
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,210
Chain link is a blockchain for oracles.

323
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,130
It integrates with other blockchains to enable their

324
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,618
smart contracts to obtain data from the offline

325
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:45,918
or centralized world. For example,

326
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:49,642
you can make database query or request

327
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:53,578
information from a web API to

328
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:57,202
get the price of bitcoin. This is only a review

329
00:21:57,256 --> 00:22:00,898
of the top blockchains to work on. New blockchains are always

330
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:04,590
coming online and they implement new functionality

331
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,862
as well, so there's plenty to watch

332
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:11,062
out for. Where can you learn more?

333
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,614
Naturally, we can start with various documentations on

334
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:18,170
the specific blockchains such as

335
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,518
Ethereum. However, once you advance a bit further,

336
00:22:22,614 --> 00:22:26,890
Amorgo provides courses for a variety of technical

337
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,546
and non technical topics in the blockchain

338
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:34,654
world, and you can obtain certification if you complete one

339
00:22:34,692 --> 00:22:38,014
of the courses. Build space is

340
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:42,126
also a good place to learn to code on the blockchain. While doing it,

341
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:46,154
you will also learn earn non fungible tokens

342
00:22:46,202 --> 00:22:49,040
for each course you complete on time.

343
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,926
Crowdflation is an open source project building a

344
00:22:52,948 --> 00:22:57,026
decentralized autonomous mission on the blockchain

345
00:22:57,138 --> 00:23:01,586
to crowdsourcing data from the people built an alternative

346
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:05,426
inflation index. Participants are rewarded

347
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:09,334
with a cryptocurrency token. Thank you all for

348
00:23:09,372 --> 00:23:13,030
listening and for making this talk

349
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:13,880
happen.
