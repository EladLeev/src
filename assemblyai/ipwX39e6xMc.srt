1
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,090
I love tv series about firefighters. The firefighter

2
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,662
devotion and leadership skills inspire me.

3
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:46,786
I know it's totally different, but I see DevOps

4
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:50,094
teams as firefighters, maybe because they

5
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:53,406
first responders in production incidents and it

6
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,134
seems they are heroes that save the day. Then come the

7
00:00:57,172 --> 00:01:00,826
developers to aid hi, I'm Einat

8
00:01:00,858 --> 00:01:04,814
Mahat, an R D group leader at Sky Fighting Production

9
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:08,334
incidents. For over a decade, since I was a junior

10
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:12,402
developer, I was drawn to production intensive dev

11
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:15,994
teams later on. While leading such teams,

12
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:20,194
we had a lot of action and I felt like a firefighter's

13
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:23,206
lieutenant, metaphorically speaking, of course.

14
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:27,838
And then it hit me, yes, we are great, we are true heroes,

15
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,626
but some of the fires we actually set

16
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:36,246
ourselves. Ness reminded me of the arsonist firefighter.

17
00:01:36,358 --> 00:01:39,866
I saw it in some episode and yes, it's a real thing.

18
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:43,882
In a nutshell, it's a firefighter that sets fires

19
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:47,934
only to become a hero. I'm not suggesting that any of

20
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:51,326
you set fires on purpose or that you do it

21
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:55,410
to become heroes, but I think that

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,362
as developers, there are several things we can and should

23
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,562
do to prevent the next fires rather than set

24
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:05,966
it and put it out. Fighting fires

25
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:09,414
for a living can lead to burnout and sometimes even

26
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:12,934
cause many trauma. In a formal group of mine where we

27
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:17,080
had major incidents, too often, one of the team members

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,206
still get anxious every time he hears his phone ring.

29
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:24,794
Let's talk about a few ways that might help

30
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:27,434
us to prevent the next fire.

31
00:02:27,632 --> 00:02:31,450
Monitoring is a crucial component of incident

32
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,978
prevention. The purpose of monitoring is to provide visibility

33
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:40,094
into the performance, availability, and the general health

34
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:43,906
of systems. Monitoring is an art,

35
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:48,270
collecting and analyzing the data from various sources

36
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,634
and crafting the right dashboards that will have the

37
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,382
exact data enough but not too much

38
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:58,758
to provide visibility but not overwhelm us.

39
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:02,630
Investing in monitoring will be helpful for early

40
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,242
detection of issues before they become incidents,

41
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:10,122
enabling us to proactively avoid issues and

42
00:03:10,176 --> 00:03:14,554
prevent incidents. Good monitoring can also help us.

43
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:18,122
During an incident, the teams can use

44
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:21,946
the dashboards to quickly identify issues and resolve

45
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:25,774
them and minimize their impact. Monitoring is

46
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:29,626
great, but the issues should be brought

47
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:32,938
to us via alerts. In push, not pull,

48
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:36,942
alerts can be a powerful tool for incident production

49
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:40,974
and response. By configuring alerts correctly

50
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:44,910
to trigger when certain conditions are met, they provide

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,222
teams with early warning of potential issues and

52
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:52,838
enable them to take actions before those issues

53
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:57,422
become serious problems. Alerts typically generate

54
00:03:57,506 --> 00:04:01,302
notifications, which may be delivered via

55
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:05,482
email, SMS, or a collaborative tool

56
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:10,034
like Slack. Some alerts will be sent to the responsible

57
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:14,474
teams, while others will be sent to the engineer

58
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:18,766
on call depends on alert severity to ensure that the

59
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:22,262
person receiving the alert can take action

60
00:04:22,426 --> 00:04:26,830
even in the middle of the night. The alert should provide sufficient

61
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,334
information when it comes to alerts,

62
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:33,682
same as in monitoring. The trick is to know

63
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:37,142
the balance between too much and too little.

64
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:41,094
We want the alerts to detect the issues but not cause

65
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:44,386
alerts fatigue. Furthermore,

66
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:48,582
having too many false alerts can make it harder

67
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:53,366
to take genuine alerts seriously.

68
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:57,174
A postmortem, also known as a lesson learned

69
00:04:57,222 --> 00:05:00,778
or a debrief, is a common practice.

70
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:04,606
We discuss what happened in an incident or event,

71
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:07,998
good or bad, and learn from it.

72
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:11,726
The goal of a postmortem is to identify the

73
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:15,970
root cause of the incident, understand what

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,254
went wrong, and determine what can be done to prevent

75
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:23,762
similar incidents in the future. The culture around

76
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:27,214
it should be one of facts and learnings rather than finger

77
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:31,074
pointing. The postmodern process typically includes

78
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:34,342
three steps. The first is gathering data

79
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:38,214
about the incident, including the timeline of events, the impact

80
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:41,722
on users and business operation, and any other

81
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:45,702
relevant data. The second step is to identify

82
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:50,060
the root cause of the incident, what went wrong, and why,

83
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,106
and the third is creating action items

84
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:58,282
based on the findings and following up on them. By conducting

85
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:02,522
postmortems on a regular basis and implementing the

86
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,930
lesson learned from each incident,

87
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,950
teams can reduce the frequency and severity of incidents.

88
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,362
It's important to know that production incidents can still

89
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,150
happen even if you're not on call,

90
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,654
so it might be beneficial to read most

91
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:23,400
debriefs and learn from the experience of others.

92
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,126
Most of us know what postmortem is, but there

93
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:30,982
is also a premortem. It fits well when performing critical

94
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:34,346
changes in production, but not only before we go

95
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:38,282
to production. We gather the items at risk and

96
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:41,674
talk about how we can prevent them from catching

97
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:45,118
fire. The technique is to imagine that a project

98
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:49,054
has already failed and then identify the reasons for

99
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:52,758
the failure. This approach helps teams

100
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:56,398
anticipate potential issues and develop mitigation

101
00:06:56,494 --> 00:07:00,194
strategies before they become actual problems

102
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:04,302
and prevent incidents. The process typically

103
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:07,942
involves three steps with the team and

104
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:11,570
stakeholders. One, imagine failure.

105
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,974
We are in production and there is a failure. What can it be?

106
00:07:16,092 --> 00:07:19,574
Brainstorm potential issues and consider worst

107
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:23,478
case scenarios. Two, identify risks.

108
00:07:23,654 --> 00:07:27,158
What are the major risks? Their potential impact

109
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:31,050
and priorities. Three, develop mitigation

110
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,766
strategies. What could have been done to

111
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:39,690
prevent this, or mitigate the issues? By conducting a premortem,

112
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,858
teams can be better prepared to address potential issues

113
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:47,550
and reduce the likelihood of incidents or downtime.

114
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,118
It can also help teams build confidence

115
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:55,206
in their change and improve the overall quality and

116
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:58,994
health of their systems. Rollout and rollback

117
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:02,934
plans are critical components of development and deployment process

118
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:07,046
designed to ensure that changes are implemented in

119
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:10,774
a controlled manner. The rollout plan usually includes

120
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:14,038
the order in which components will be updated,

121
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:17,718
the timing, and the required resources.

122
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:21,962
A good rollout plan will also identify potential risks

123
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:26,058
and include issues that may arise

124
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:30,154
and consider mitigations. There is a debate

125
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:33,822
about whether or not everything should run in gradual rollout,

126
00:08:33,966 --> 00:08:38,210
but the rollback plans are often skipped. I think that

127
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,854
for critical changes, we should plan our exit

128
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:45,798
strategy. That's a rollback plan. A rollback plan

129
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:49,606
outlines the steps that will be taken to undo a

130
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:53,686
deployment and revert back to a previous version of

131
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:57,758
the system. It should also include a clear criteria

132
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,142
for when to initiate a rollback.

133
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:05,382
The purpose of these plans is to help ensure

134
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:08,746
that changes are implemented in a way that minimize the

135
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:12,314
risk of downtime. By having a clear and well defined

136
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:16,254
rollout and rollback plan in place, teams can be

137
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:20,350
more confident in their ability to make changes while also

138
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,450
being better prepared to respond effectively when issues

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,354
occur. Runbooks are a set of procedures we

140
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:32,286
write for common things that might break and how to troubleshoot

141
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,794
and tackle them. Runbooks are designed to help teams

142
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,254
perform tasks consistently and efficiently and

143
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:43,170
can be used by both developers and operation teams.

144
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,266
In general, runbooks contains step by step

145
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:51,226
instructions for carrying out common tasks and may

146
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:55,190
also include visual aids to help clarify complex

147
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,114
procedures. The main benefits of roundbooks are that they

148
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:02,570
help ensure that tasks are performed consistently

149
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:06,570
and accurately, even in high pressure situations.

150
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,126
By creating and maintaining runbooks, teams can reduce the

151
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:14,014
risk of errors and increase the speed and efficiency

152
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:18,242
of their operations. Creating solid runbooks is

153
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:22,258
helpful during an incidents, but we can also use it

154
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:26,946
to think about potential errors and prevent incidents.

155
00:10:27,138 --> 00:10:30,998
I believe in continuous improvement in life

156
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:35,266
at work and specifically when talking about systems

157
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:40,038
and incidents. Continuous improvement in this context

158
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:43,494
includes regularly reviewing and refining

159
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:47,754
our process tools and systems to ensure that we

160
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:50,814
are continuously improving our ability to

161
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:54,814
prevent incidents and efficiently respond to them.

162
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:58,282
This involves conducting regular

163
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:02,474
retrospectives to identify areas for

164
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:06,158
improvement, implementing a process of regularly

165
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:10,478
reviewing and updating runbooks, monitoring and analyzing

166
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:14,066
incident trends to identify patterns and

167
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:17,986
root causes, and seeking feedback from users

168
00:11:18,018 --> 00:11:21,702
and stakeholders to identify areas where

169
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:25,254
we can improve. By continuously improving our

170
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:28,822
processes and systems, we can help ensure

171
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:32,154
that we are always learning from

172
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,074
incidents and working to prevent them from happening again

173
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:40,150
in the future. We talked about

174
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,902
seven ways to prevent fires, and there are

175
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,760
many, many more.

176
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,658
Unfortunately, we will not be able to prevent

177
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:53,362
all fires, so let's talk about the

178
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,834
most important thing during an

179
00:11:56,872 --> 00:12:00,882
incident communication during

180
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:05,018
an incident. There is a lot going on on the scene.

181
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:08,200
There are many people that need to work together.

182
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,914
I use these three guidelines to ensure clear and effective

183
00:12:12,962 --> 00:12:15,750
communication during incidents.

184
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,226
Have an incident communication plan.

185
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,302
Keep all stakeholders informed about the status,

186
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:29,114
technical people, management, customers and

187
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:32,842
others. Decide who will be responsible

188
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:36,686
for communicating and what information will be

189
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:40,794
shared. Assign clear roles

190
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:44,418
and responsibilities to individuals involved in

191
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:47,906
resolving the incident. This helps to

192
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:51,474
ensure that everyone knows what is expected of

193
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:55,618
them and provide regular

194
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:59,506
updates. This helps to keep everyone informed

195
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:03,378
about the status. Use clear and concise language.

196
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:07,254
Avoid technical terms. When talking to

197
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:11,338
nontechnical stakeholders, it is important

198
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:14,890
to be transparent about the incident. You must

199
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,266
communicate. You have to update on your

200
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:22,190
progress and make sure everyone is aligned

201
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,526
well, we did not save any fires. We did

202
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:31,562
not even save a kitten stuck on a tree.

203
00:13:31,706 --> 00:13:36,266
But from my experience fighting production incidents

204
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,982
called fires in this session, I can definitely

205
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:43,422
say we all can prevent the next fire.

206
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,314
Instead of setting it yourself. Don't be an arsonist

207
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:50,150
firefighter, be a true hero.

208
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,280
Thank you.
