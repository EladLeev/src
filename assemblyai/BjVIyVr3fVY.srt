00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,142
Hi, welcome to our platform engineering from the trenches talk a deal

2
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:01,454
of beautiful vistas and open sewers. My name is

3
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:04,606
Gert. I work for Q Qxperts, which is

4
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:08,306
part of CBI. I work as a product owner for continuous delivery

5
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:11,766
platforms. My name is Hug Staplesva. I'm also a

6
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:15,714
product owner for the CDAs platform and for pipeline enablement

7
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:18,882
within national and Ayland. That's a

8
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:22,394
big insurance company within the Netherlands. So in this talk,

9
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:26,182
we'll take you through our experiences building platforms

10
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:30,134
over the last few years. We've been doing that both in various

11
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:33,390
roles, I guess engineering and,

12
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,926
well, as the slide says, currently we're both working as

13
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,494
product owner. So yeah, we have a story to share and

14
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:44,180
some lessons learned so you don't fall into the same traps as we did.

15
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,460
Yeah. Let's first take you through the agenda for this talk.

16
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,854
We'll start off by setting the scene and then giving you an overview

17
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:57,542
of our teams versus actual reality. We'll be talking

18
00:02:57,596 --> 00:03:01,174
rainbows and unicorns. Then the juicy part,

19
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,534
tensions from the trenches. And then we'll spend a little

20
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:07,926
time talking on where we see ourselves move. Yeah. Just to give

21
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:11,386
you an insight what we're working on and which you perhaps can

22
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:14,602
take as inspiration for yourself. So let's first

23
00:03:14,656 --> 00:03:18,394
set the scene. It's also important we

24
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:22,234
both work in largely federated organizations,

25
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:25,520
so we have lots of customers that are dealing with,

26
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,602
that are internal customers and we are within a regulated environment

27
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:34,622
as well. And that means that we're subject to

28
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,320
rules coming from the financial sector, rules maybe

29
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,250
around privacy. And most of the times

30
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,078
we are in a central part of the organization where

31
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:51,014
costs are actually very important so

32
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:54,630
that you have to bring costs down and it

33
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,594
is still considered a cost center and

34
00:03:58,732 --> 00:04:02,746
we are part of centralized it. So sometimes

35
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:06,554
you get a bit of a feeling that you are

36
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:10,054
from the ivory tower and you're telling everybody how you should do

37
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,854
things. And finally, we are

38
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:17,642
dealing with limited

39
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:21,760
innovation or speed of innovation. This is where

40
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,602
the platform dream and what the reality is.

41
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:30,626
So we are dealing with both the

42
00:04:30,648 --> 00:04:35,620
vision there where we want to go and

43
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,614
all the troubles that we have or the impediments that we have

44
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:44,294
to face or that we have to resolve. Yeah.

45
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:47,606
The interesting thing here is with these huge organizations is

46
00:04:47,628 --> 00:04:51,306
that especially these federated organizations, is that you

47
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:54,934
have so many people there, each with their own ideas

48
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:58,374
and their own agendas and their own goals,

49
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:02,350
because in the end everybody is trying to achieve something. So everybody

50
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,382
has his own goals and

51
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,614
bringing that together. Yeah,

52
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:12,400
that is quite complex, but also interesting.

53
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,810
So if you look at it from a platform engineering perspective,

54
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,402
what you ideally want if you're building a platform

55
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:26,158
is frictionless delivery

56
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:30,520
of business value. You see the picture with

57
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,840
the person playing curling. That's the way I really see

58
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,780
how platform engineering teams work,

59
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,594
moving this broom so that the

60
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:47,546
curling stone slides with almost no resistance all

61
00:05:47,568 --> 00:05:51,438
the way across

62
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:54,960
the lane. So yeah,

63
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,082
this perfect, seamless,

64
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:02,030
frictionless way of delivering software,

65
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,994
running software, whatever your platform is doing, that's the

66
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:09,794
ideal. It should just be working.

67
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,298
So what does it mean? It means also that

68
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:17,430
the process that are baked in into the platforms, that they are actually

69
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,030
aligned with reality.

70
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,074
So it's not something theoretical from a slide,

71
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:28,074
but people are actually behaving the way the

72
00:06:28,112 --> 00:06:31,306
process is designed, or the process is designed in such

73
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:34,170
a way that it aligns with how people are behaving.

74
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,658
Furthermore, ideally, obviously everybody has a

75
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:43,520
clear and steady goal so that you know where people are moving

76
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,958
and you also have a focus on business value. And there is always

77
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:53,090
time, and this is a real engineering one, there's always enough

78
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,562
time to build a proper solution that does

79
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,770
things proper, not a hacky way, but in a

80
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,300
perfect way. However,

81
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,960
reality is, yeah, reality is sometimes

82
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,342
something different. So first of all,

83
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:15,382
priorities, what do you do first?

84
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:19,226
How do you bring the most value to your customers who

85
00:07:19,248 --> 00:07:24,234
are actually your colleagues in such a way that you

86
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:27,690
do the most important thing first? That also

87
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,420
brings a lot of value to you as customers.

88
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,482
Most of the times we already have a huge investment,

89
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:38,670
for instance, in tools and the way they have set up.

90
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,222
And to really come up with an integrated vision is also

91
00:07:42,276 --> 00:07:48,126
meaning that you have to transform something that is transforming

92
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:51,380
while the shop is open. And of course,

93
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,938
being in enterprise, organization means that you're

94
00:07:55,954 --> 00:08:00,306
always in a changing environment. Business department

95
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:03,926
or business unit can change, stakeholders change

96
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:10,170
means also priorities change. And somehow

97
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,190
there is always the trap that you end up in the priority

98
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,886
paradox. Yeah, because that's

99
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:22,798
interesting because especially in these really

100
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:26,910
large scale organizations, these federated organizations where I

101
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,254
mentioned it earlier already as well, where people have their

102
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,390
own goals,

103
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,346
everything becomes a priority because everybody is trying to

104
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:40,706
achieve his own goals. That's what matters at the end

105
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,340
of the year, right? Yeah.

106
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,346
So priority can be a challenging part. Customer relationships

107
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:53,510
can be difficult as well, especially in a being organization.

108
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,794
It can be very difficult to see

109
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:02,602
who is your actual customer. You have people

110
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:05,882
that are making noise, so you

111
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,580
intend to move towards,

112
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,246
you usually start moving towards these people.

113
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:19,406
However, in reality, often there are a lot of other people using your platform

114
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:22,778
as well, and then you have the people

115
00:09:22,884 --> 00:09:26,450
using your platform. So engineers. But then you also have

116
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,662
usually internal security teams or compliance

117
00:09:29,726 --> 00:09:32,994
teams. Then you have architects who usually have

118
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:37,430
an idea as well about

119
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,720
what your landscape should look like.

120
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,670
So identifying these customers is already

121
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,062
hard enough. And even if you identify them,

122
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:51,500
how do you communicate with them?

123
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,546
If you're working in a small team, you can sit around the table and just

124
00:09:57,568 --> 00:10:00,202
talk to each other. But how do you do that in a large,

125
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:04,140
decentralized organization? And then

126
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,414
even if you've managed to fix that, how do you know

127
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:12,190
that you have the right features for these teams?

128
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,686
Again, if you're building something for someone who's

129
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:19,826
sitting next to you, that's easy. But how do you

130
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:23,310
do that when you're in this huge organization

131
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,000
where people might be on the other side of the world?

132
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,480
And then the last one that's also an interesting one is

133
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,630
team specific. Own solutions.

134
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,194
Usually when you come into

135
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:44,746
an organization to bring a platform, there are some problems that have

136
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:47,770
being existing for some time and teams,

137
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,230
it is usually filled with smart people.

138
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,990
So people try to build their own solutions.

139
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,134
Yeah, they work around organizational problems.

140
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:04,546
Exactly. And how do you

141
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:08,450
have a good strategy to honor what they already have built,

142
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,778
not breaking so much stuff and

143
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:16,066
also letting

144
00:11:16,098 --> 00:11:19,510
them be heard as customers and let them feel, okay,

145
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,854
this solution that I have created can

146
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,700
be part of the larger solution that we roll out as a platform.

147
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,406
Moving to our next topic,

148
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:35,946
rainbows and unicorns. Obviously we

149
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:40,334
have an idea of how this should

150
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,000
be, what this should look like.

151
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,160
So let's start there.

152
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,334
First of all, the most important thing for

153
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:53,794
us is to be customer centric. So we have to

154
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:57,826
understand our customers. We have to understand how

155
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:01,346
we collaborate with them. Of course we need

156
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:04,754
to have a feedback loop on if they are using our

157
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:08,054
product, how are they using

158
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:12,342
our products? Are they happy with the product? And we

159
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:15,830
want to do something that does not need

160
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:21,206
force. So, meaning that we seduce our customers instead

161
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,850
of having a force adoption.

162
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,550
And of course we want to see our customers or our colleagues

163
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,590
actually as partners within collaborating on

164
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,440
creating this new platform.

165
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,026
That's interesting because platforms are not a

166
00:12:43,048 --> 00:12:46,386
new concept, but this whole shift in how

167
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:49,986
do we collaborate with our users, and especially the

168
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:53,874
don't use force part, but treat

169
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:58,054
your customer like a customer, make them happy. That is

170
00:12:58,172 --> 00:13:02,790
something relatively new but essential

171
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,390
to get your platform successfully adapted.

172
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,210
Yeah. And the second topic that ties into this is the product

173
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,020
mindset. Product thinking will help you

174
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,878
design your platform in such a way that it actually

175
00:13:19,984 --> 00:13:23,886
really focuses on two things at

176
00:13:23,908 --> 00:13:28,734
one hand, balance. So balance between the

177
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:30,270
customer requests,

178
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,350
which are usually opinionated on how something should be resolved.

179
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,726
But yeah, also about how

180
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:46,120
do you cope with the problems as a whole and

181
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,622
also bringing it there in the dynamic of

182
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:53,142
how do we solve this problem right now? Because usually

183
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:56,934
a team comes towards you with an urgent problem

184
00:13:56,972 --> 00:14:00,266
that they want to have resolved right now, but how does that fit into your

185
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:01,530
long term vision?

186
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,980
And the second part is about real value.

187
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,542
So it's really important to find your unique value

188
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:16,414
proposition for your platform and that is

189
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:22,014
unique to your context. Every organization is

190
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:26,110
different, so that means that we're talking principles now,

191
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,978
which we think are quite generic.

192
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:33,326
However, how you apply them in

193
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:37,478
your own organization can be completely different.

194
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,360
So also coming back to that,

195
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,878
if we look at the goals that we set for our platform,

196
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:46,600
it's frictionless delivery of business value.

197
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,178
But in a startup that can mean completely

198
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:55,062
something different than in a heavily regulated environment.

199
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:58,554
For startups, it could mean we all want

200
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:02,362
to have speed where in regulated environments

201
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:05,706
it could be security and compliant, where you offer lots

202
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,390
of services that could be your unique value proposition

203
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,886
for your product. Yeah, and as users

204
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:17,602
on board, on your platform, your platform grows and this

205
00:15:17,656 --> 00:15:21,700
evolves also over time. So it's really important to

206
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,702
every now and then, step back a little bit and think,

207
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:27,960
hey, are we still on the right course?

208
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,342
And the second point is, what's also really

209
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,862
important is always focus on capabilities rather

210
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:39,980
than tools. We all

211
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,610
have our own personal preference regarding tooling,

212
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,430
and we always think that the tool we use is the tool

213
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,710
best, otherwise we wouldn't be using it.

214
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,720
However, you need to find a balance there,

215
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:03,440
or you need to find a balance and instead focus on

216
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,860
what are we trying to achieve here,

217
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,234
what are we trying to do? And since your

218
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:15,070
platform is generic, how can we do it in such a way that might

219
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,854
not fit with the ideal tool for

220
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:22,930
a specific team, but rather empowers

221
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,470
all teams using the platform to use this certain capability.

222
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,162
So of course, measuring your success is also very

223
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:36,426
important. And because this

224
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:40,106
is the rainbows and unicorns part of

225
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:43,614
our presentation, it's really interesting. So it's the

226
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:47,006
obvious that you have to measure, but what do

227
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:51,070
you measure and where do you start? So our opinion is here,

228
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,354
let's start simple. So, measuring numbers of

229
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:57,938
user, number of projects, but there are already a

230
00:16:57,944 --> 00:17:01,742
lot of measures out there that are really quite wonderful

231
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:06,434
to use when it comes to delivering

232
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:10,246
more technical platforms like the

233
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:13,798
Doya metrics that are described in

234
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:16,950
the book, accelerate or sdp metrics.

235
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,394
And of course, it's also important to start with

236
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:21,740
metrics for people.

237
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,490
Start talking to people, for instance, to gather feedback,

238
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,394
but also measure things like customer engagement

239
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:36,414
or employee satisfaction to see whether people are

240
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:39,870
really happy with the product that you are creating.

241
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,914
Without these measures, you're not in

242
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:48,370
the business, I think, of running a proper platform.

243
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,754
I think your customers are your

244
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:56,934
way to success because then you're bringing real value to

245
00:17:56,972 --> 00:18:00,854
them and you're also achieving your

246
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:04,598
goal of delivering business

247
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:08,460
value. Yeah, the interesting thing here is

248
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,238
we coin these automated trend analysis

249
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:19,226
terms, but this is not where

250
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:24,282
you start. You can always start relatively

251
00:18:24,346 --> 00:18:27,710
easy, low level, just by starting to talk towards

252
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,166
people and then only as your platforms grows in

253
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:34,580
maturity, also grow in maturity of how you

254
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,770
gather these measurements.

255
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,020
Don't try to do it perfect at once.

256
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,494
But be mindful though that you do want to

257
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:50,966
be measuring. You do want to be measuring, so it

258
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,720
should be integrated part of what you do.

259
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,226
Okay then a

260
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:04,700
unicorn topic is self service.

261
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:10,254
These platforms where their value really also

262
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:14,334
is in how they can easily scale. So how

263
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:17,680
you can onboard more and more users without

264
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,202
becoming a bottleneck yourself. So self

265
00:19:23,256 --> 00:19:26,642
service and enabling your

266
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:30,420
teams to do stuff themselves,

267
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,302
that's really important. So empower

268
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:38,454
them and also make

269
00:19:38,492 --> 00:19:42,358
it easy to use your platform. We were talking about this product thinking

270
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:45,874
earlier, people should not be annoyed

271
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:50,186
to use your platform, but rather be happy because

272
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:53,734
you're solving an issue for them, something less for them to worry

273
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:57,578
about. Yeah, and last point,

274
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:00,814
also, always be sure to

275
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:04,398
remove waiting times if you go shopping in the

276
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,742
supermarket. I don't know about

277
00:20:07,796 --> 00:20:11,118
you guys, but I already get annoyed when I need

278
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:15,586
to wait for like a minute before I can do

279
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:18,786
the checkout of my groceries, let alone if

280
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:23,460
I need to wait four weeks before my new project

281
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,560
is available for me on a certain platform.

282
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,366
So remove waiting times. Yeah, I think that is one

283
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:34,982
of the most important things that you can do to really

284
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:39,590
improve the customer experience and also improve,

285
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,660
for instance, employee satisfaction within your company

286
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,934
because things are easy and teams

287
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:53,086
can then focus on the things that on

288
00:20:53,108 --> 00:20:56,734
their own goals instead of dealing with the toil within

289
00:20:56,772 --> 00:21:00,334
the organization. Yeah, especially when working

290
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:04,820
in agile environments, people, they are working with

291
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,874
the small increment of work that they are working on. So if they

292
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:13,374
need something and they get to you, they need something and otherwise

293
00:21:13,422 --> 00:21:16,934
they get stuck and you don't want to be yet

294
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:20,022
another impediment. All right,

295
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:23,510
so this is our

296
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,680
magic rainbow unicorn world.

297
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,902
Obviously reality

298
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:36,426
is not that perfect all

299
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:40,006
the time. Of course we're product owner, so we have to sell our

300
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,466
platform. So we might say it is so. But I'm

301
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:46,080
telling you right now, it's not always like that.

302
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,460
What we will be sharing here is our insights of

303
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:01,022
how did we start building platforms ourselves.

304
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,214
First of all, we needed to build trust

305
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:09,590
and help people agree

306
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,480
that we are going to build a platform.

307
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,480
And the interesting thing here is,

308
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,786
well, at least my first pitfall was how

309
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:24,054
do you build trust? I thought you do it by proving

310
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:28,026
that you can do what you say.

311
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:32,110
So it would be by building stuff, building new capabilities.

312
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,280
However, reality shows that people,

313
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,086
well, obviously they care about this new stuff as

314
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:44,274
well, but it's way more important indeed that

315
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:48,146
they trust you. So focus on the person.

316
00:22:48,328 --> 00:22:52,242
Yeah, indeed. So build up

317
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:55,862
relationships with people. This is one important

318
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,794
thing I learned as well. Build up this relationship. Tell the vision

319
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:03,686
that you have on your platform, what your problems that

320
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:08,122
you're going to solve. And also

321
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:11,514
be aware that these

322
00:23:11,552 --> 00:23:14,954
things take a long time. You are

323
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:18,266
building something foundational that is going to be

324
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:21,854
used through all alti whole company. And that

325
00:23:21,892 --> 00:23:25,550
means that you have to talk to a lot of people to get your message

326
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,174
across. And also what

327
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:33,990
we notice is that you really have to focus on influencing

328
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,794
the right people and the right teams so that you can get

329
00:23:37,832 --> 00:23:41,038
some traction. That is an important lesson that I have learned.

330
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:45,006
Yeah. And the interesting thing is usually

331
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:48,854
within your customer base you have a few people

332
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:52,662
who are very vocal about any issues they run

333
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:55,000
into, capabilities they want.

334
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,802
However, be always sure to check that

335
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:04,140
these people are not just some people

336
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,354
who are trying to solve their own problems, but rather are the people that are

337
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,070
really influencing what's going on in the organization.

338
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,630
Because usually it turns out that there are some people,

339
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,040
at least some people who are less outspoken, who are,

340
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,922
because of the

341
00:24:25,976 --> 00:24:30,610
social role they have in the organization, are actually way more influencing

342
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,220
your customers. So figure that out.

343
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:42,102
Yeah. And one thing that I really

344
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:45,858
wanted to briefly add as well is regarding

345
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:50,426
the pacer steps. So we were talking already about this

346
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:54,362
whole organization that is moving. But be

347
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:58,060
mindful of the pace that you are making this change because

348
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,360
depending on what your goal is,

349
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,440
people need to be able to move with you.

350
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,466
If you're being away a part of the organization and you're

351
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:15,186
focusing on to a certain x percent of the organization that

352
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,766
you want to move with you and you don't

353
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,674
care about the rest, you can set

354
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:26,358
a completely different pace than when you want to

355
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,406
move your whole organization with you. Because then

356
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,846
people indeed need to learn as well. Yeah. So a good example

357
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:36,310
here is if you're, for instance,

358
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,534
responsible for maybe some security and compliance

359
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,730
checks, you can make it a direct stop

360
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,570
of what a team is doing. But instead

361
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,294
of educated teams,

362
00:25:52,422 --> 00:25:56,046
hey, this is what we're going to introduce. This is what you need to

363
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:59,502
do. And maybe this is a channel where you can ask for help.

364
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:03,526
And that is really how you pace

365
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:07,486
yourself, but also move at the speed

366
00:26:07,518 --> 00:26:12,110
of the organization and also ensure

367
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,686
that it's adopted by everybody. And otherwise you

368
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,470
become this platform of frustration.

369
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,520
And that is, I think, an important learning as well. Yeah.

370
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:29,142
Know who your first followers are, who helps you create

371
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:32,442
this movement. And the last

372
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:36,234
one also to briefly stop by again about

373
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:38,140
recognizing what's there.

374
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,994
Be aware about. We mentioned it earlier

375
00:26:44,122 --> 00:26:47,280
already. Be aware of what is there already,

376
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,854
and not because of the

377
00:26:51,892 --> 00:26:53,460
technology that it is,

378
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,610
but also because it was created in a certain context.

379
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,234
Some decisions were taken at some point in time. So it's always

380
00:27:03,432 --> 00:27:07,318
good to be mindful of this context as well. Even it

381
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:12,198
might not be obvious from the solution itself because

382
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:16,422
there are pitfalls that you can fall into again. So better

383
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:20,086
prevent that when you then start delivering

384
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:23,580
your platform, there are a few things that you need to think about.

385
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,770
First of all, yes, we were talking about building this trust,

386
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,440
but in the end, delivering something,

387
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,090
how minor the increment is, is essential

388
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,142
because it will

389
00:27:40,196 --> 00:27:43,300
allow you to start getting feedback on what you're building.

390
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,374
So my personal take on this is being launching

391
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:52,622
customers. So for every new capability

392
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:56,260
that you're building, focus on

393
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,806
find at least a single team in the organization that will be using this

394
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:04,150
capability. By the way, good double checker.

395
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,106
If you can't find a team that is willing to use your

396
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:11,610
capability, you're probably building the wrong stuff. Yeah,

397
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,700
so I completely agree with that.

398
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,174
But often teams are already asking for capabilities

399
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:22,814
and try

400
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:26,926
to build it with them together. Offer them a channel to

401
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:30,574
really communicate with you on every iteration that you

402
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:34,190
deliver to your customer. Also have a discussion

403
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,522
of there are some downsides for

404
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:41,490
every feature that you deliver,

405
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:47,414
make these decisions together because they

406
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:50,966
have the advantage of being the first mover for that capability or

407
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:54,502
that solution that you're offering. But you

408
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:58,006
always have to keep every user of your platform in

409
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:58,600
mind.

410
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:06,038
In a sense, you become a bit of the devil's advocate

411
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:11,070
of the organization when meeting

412
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,990
the demand, maybe of one or two single teams. Yeah,

413
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,200
what Hulk mentions here is really important.

414
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,194
You're building this for the organization as a whole. So working

415
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:27,554
together with this launching customer doesn't mean that you're going to do

416
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:31,234
exactly as they say, per se, because you need to,

417
00:29:31,432 --> 00:29:35,670
also need to take into consideration this bigger vision

418
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,614
and also the needs of the organization as a whole.

419
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,726
So working towards an

420
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:48,342
evolutionary model is always a practical

421
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,660
approach there.

422
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,722
Yeah. Two more things for this

423
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:58,874
iterative platforms delivery. First of all,

424
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:02,810
create an upward spiral. These processes,

425
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,942
like Ilka already said, can be long, so it's good to

426
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:11,706
get frequent positive reinforcement.

427
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:15,694
You can do that by

428
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:19,006
often releasing small new capabilities that make

429
00:30:19,028 --> 00:30:22,654
the lives of your users happy or

430
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:26,806
better. And that's good for the

431
00:30:26,828 --> 00:30:30,822
spirit of your users, but it's also

432
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:32,920
good for the spirit of your own team.

433
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,880
About this team,

434
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,660
get tough people in there.

435
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,650
Well, the icon shows a rugby player.

436
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,754
You can choose rugby players. It's not necessary

437
00:30:51,802 --> 00:30:55,866
per se, but the thing here is platforms

438
00:30:55,898 --> 00:30:59,600
are complex. You're building

439
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,540
complex multilayered stuff.

440
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,242
So you need a team that loves hard problems.

441
00:31:08,376 --> 00:31:11,618
Yeah. So indeed you need a team that

442
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:15,586
really loves hard problems and likes

443
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:19,080
to also solve those for everybody.

444
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,394
So a platform is an excellent

445
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:27,614
mechanism to scale out certain capabilities

446
00:31:27,682 --> 00:31:31,754
within your organization. But most of these

447
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:34,730
problems are really hard problems that you have to solve.

448
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,314
So you need people who can

449
00:31:38,352 --> 00:31:41,934
deal with it, or you need a team really that can

450
00:31:41,972 --> 00:31:44,750
deal with this context.

451
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,198
So of course we always

452
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,834
need some platform design principles. If you don't start out

453
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:56,866
with principles, you will run out into problems

454
00:31:56,968 --> 00:32:00,574
with these principles. It's a bit of a guidance

455
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:04,130
that you offer also the team that builds

456
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,520
the solution, but it also offers a way

457
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,846
to communicate to your customers a

458
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:17,254
couple of principles that we saw that were essential for us.

459
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:19,994
So first of all, is the authorization model.

460
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:23,658
It is really the foundation that you have to build everything

461
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:26,620
on. Without a good authorization model,

462
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,230
especially in a regulated environment,

463
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,294
you cannot build those integrated capabilities that you want to

464
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:38,750
offer, but you also

465
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,726
want to. One of the principles is reduce

466
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:44,740
the number of touch points.

467
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,370
The strategy that hitting and I

468
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,826
both chose were a more reactive or event driven

469
00:32:55,858 --> 00:32:59,650
approach, so that people can use the tools

470
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:03,142
as they were intended. But these

471
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:06,486
tools, we do our magic on top of

472
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:09,526
those tools or beside of those tools.

473
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:14,198
So without the customer knowing

474
00:33:14,374 --> 00:33:17,958
that we do something to improve that capability

475
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:21,534
that they're using. And of course we

476
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:25,306
want to create working standards or define

477
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:29,280
working standards. And there is always

478
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:35,234
a bit of a trade off between simplicity. So how

479
00:33:35,272 --> 00:33:38,674
can we dumb down this particular process or

480
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:43,170
this particular way of working versus is it really compatible

481
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,230
with everything within the organization?

482
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,630
And lastly, we don't want to break

483
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,486
stuff or we don't want to fix

484
00:33:54,668 --> 00:33:55,960
things that work.

485
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:03,930
There is always a bit of a history of using

486
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,814
certain tools already in the organization

487
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:12,270
and you're building a platform, maybe next or on top of those tools.

488
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,800
So you don't want to break the experience

489
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,766
or radically break the experience of the people who

490
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:25,234
are using those tools. You have to have a really soft touch so

491
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:31,202
that people keep enthusiastic about your platform and

492
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:34,846
that you're really offering something more than the tool itself.

493
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:38,326
It's really about the integrated solution that

494
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:41,574
you're building and solving those complex problems

495
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:44,822
for those teams. Yeah, and this is also again,

496
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:48,678
where this frequent feature or capability

497
00:34:48,774 --> 00:34:52,314
delivery comes in as well. If you

498
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:56,906
take small steps and take them often, then this

499
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,830
is a journey that you can make together

500
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,826
with your users, rather than throwing helps

501
00:35:04,858 --> 00:35:08,960
and helps of unwanted change upon them.

502
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,790
Also, one of the things we really like to do is building

503
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,540
a community around our platform.

504
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,260
This is actually for multiple reasons. First of all,

505
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,490
for knowledge sharing purposes.

506
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,494
What we figured out is, especially if you work in

507
00:35:29,532 --> 00:35:32,866
large organizations, often multiple

508
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:36,726
people are looking for the same answers. So if you

509
00:35:36,908 --> 00:35:41,462
have a centralized community, it becomes

510
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:44,170
easier for people to find their answers.

511
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:53,070
And also what can happen is that actually

512
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,600
users start help each other out.

513
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:03,394
As one of these communities grow and people become more

514
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:08,610
involved in it, they are also more willing and almost

515
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,420
automatically starting to share their own

516
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:18,086
knowledge and also their own experience. And if

517
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:20,920
they don't know something, they will start asking questions.

518
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:24,534
And these

519
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:28,090
questions are interesting for you as a platform

520
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,780
development team because it will give you insight in

521
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,682
what's going on with your user. So if

522
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:42,030
people ask the same question over and over again,

523
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,486
don't be annoyed with it, but learn from it. Hey,

524
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:49,694
why are people asking this

525
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:53,458
over and over again? Is our documentation not clear enough

526
00:36:53,544 --> 00:37:00,434
or is there a hiccup in the system? Or is

527
00:37:00,472 --> 00:37:03,730
the experience of our platform as a whole lacking?

528
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,410
Yeah, use it as a moment to learn.

529
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,682
Yeah. So very good way to receive feedback

530
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:15,526
on what you're building and

531
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:18,902
what you're delivering to your colleagues.

532
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:23,174
Yeah. And then last one, also standardize

533
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:26,842
on the way you communicate. I personally have a very strong

534
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:30,606
preference of single chat channel.

535
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:34,080
Either be in teams or slack or whatever tool you're being,

536
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:42,254
moving all the communication there, because it

537
00:37:42,292 --> 00:37:46,082
will allow teams to understand where they

538
00:37:46,136 --> 00:37:49,460
go with their questions and go to meet the community.

539
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,070
And also always be mindful that you're open

540
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,734
communicating here. So for example, one of the

541
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:03,062
patterns that I really focus on is if the

542
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:07,126
question pops up, answer it in

543
00:38:07,148 --> 00:38:10,442
this channel. Yeah, we sometimes

544
00:38:10,576 --> 00:38:14,060
even go as far. If you get a direct question

545
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,394
from one of your colleagues who is using your platform, ask them

546
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:21,914
to repost the question in decentralized

547
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:25,982
channel, because not only

548
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:29,998
you are going to learn from it, you can see whether others

549
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:34,046
are also experiencing this problem, but it's

550
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:38,994
also a great opportunity to help inform others how

551
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:41,620
you can solve a certain problem within the platform.

552
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,438
And lastly, this will also help again build trust in

553
00:38:46,444 --> 00:38:49,714
your platform because it shows to your users

554
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:53,254
that you care about their questions and care about their

555
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:57,490
opinions and see that you're engaged and that you're actually

556
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,274
intending to work with them to build the best experience possible.

557
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:04,762
Yeah, I think it's a good lesson to learn as well

558
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:07,900
to really think about community here.

559
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,438
So we, as platform

560
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:17,502
team or platform team owners, we are really on a

561
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:21,646
healthy diet of complexity. And when

562
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:25,186
you go back to one of our first slides, we said we want

563
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:29,266
to have friction delivery of business value. I think

564
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:33,170
when we're eating complexity, and especially within the enterprise,

565
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,746
we can eat a lot of complexity

566
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,762
and make sure that every feature

567
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:45,240
team, for instance, is able to deliver as fast as possible.

568
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,898
And yeah, there is something

569
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:52,170
called core versus context.

570
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,834
We are really in the business of helping teams focus on

571
00:39:57,872 --> 00:40:01,566
core instead of context. And again,

572
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:05,742
listening to our customers, receiving feedback are essential here and

573
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:09,246
also delivering a solution that really helps to

574
00:40:09,268 --> 00:40:10,670
fulfill those goal.

575
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,630
Yeah. And in addition, also be aware

576
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:19,634
that if you're starting to reduce context, so if

577
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:26,470
you are starting to abstract away complexity

578
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,110
for teams in the organization,

579
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,802
be aware that these teams are no longer aware

580
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,858
of this complexity that there is.

581
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:42,154
So that means that always think

582
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,738
about, hey, is this something that we are abstracting away

583
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:49,494
for them, but do we still want them to be aware

584
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:53,566
of? In which case you also need to make sure that you explain

585
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:57,086
what you're doing or is it safe for

586
00:40:57,108 --> 00:41:00,960
the teams to, well, just rely on it?

587
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,198
Is it just like electricity coming from an outlet?

588
00:41:05,294 --> 00:41:09,214
Yeah, exactly. It's there. You don't know how it's generated,

589
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:12,754
where it comes from. It's just there. And that is,

590
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:16,998
I think, the ultimate goal. I think also for

591
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:21,510
platform teams to just be there and help teams

592
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,878
deliver business value. Yeah. And then that also means

593
00:41:25,964 --> 00:41:29,354
that sometimes the biggest compliant you can

594
00:41:29,392 --> 00:41:32,410
get is zero compliant.

595
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,066
If you don't hear anybody. Well,

596
00:41:37,248 --> 00:41:40,974
either they're not using your platform at all, but most probably,

597
00:41:41,172 --> 00:41:43,822
at least from your other metrics that they are using it.

598
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:47,354
And if there's no complaint,

599
00:41:47,482 --> 00:41:51,360
actually it could very well mean that you're doing quite a good job.

600
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:57,522
All right, so this is our experience so

601
00:41:57,576 --> 00:42:01,682
far. Let's have a brief look at where we are moving

602
00:42:01,816 --> 00:42:05,410
towards with our own platforms.

603
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,710
First of all, it's improving metrics.

604
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,870
We actually seek two kinds of metrics.

605
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,814
The metrics from the system.

606
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:19,062
So this are usually technical

607
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:22,554
metrics, and then you have the metric from the people,

608
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:25,706
which is the complaining we're talking about,

609
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:29,242
or, well, other kinds of

610
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,814
opinions. What we're working on

611
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:36,602
is shifting there from the relatively

612
00:42:36,666 --> 00:42:40,990
easy to gather flat metrics

613
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:46,146
like number of projects or number of

614
00:42:46,168 --> 00:42:49,746
pipelines run something like that towards metrics that

615
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:54,114
are more

616
00:42:54,152 --> 00:42:57,878
interesting from a business success

617
00:42:57,964 --> 00:43:01,334
perspective. So again, here you can

618
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:05,074
think about, for example, Dora metrics or software delivery performance

619
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:07,960
metrics, but also, for example,

620
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,014
about instrumentation of capabilities.

621
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:15,690
So how are people actually using

622
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,578
this platform? And then

623
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:21,340
on the people side.

624
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,120
Yes, do surveys. Yes,

625
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:29,680
ask this feedback in your community,

626
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,754
but also think about stuff like customer

627
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:38,962
engagement or net promoter scores. Yeah. So especially

628
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:43,170
the net promoter scores are quite an interesting thing because it's

629
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,910
standardization, how you measure,

630
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,350
how building people are to promote the product that you deliver.

631
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,478
And especially when your platform is growing or you want to

632
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:58,806
grow it within the organization, or you want to have it adopted

633
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:02,602
by the organization, you need to have these

634
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:06,026
scores correctly in order so that people

635
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:09,834
are really sharing the message that

636
00:44:09,872 --> 00:44:13,630
you have within the organization. And what we mentioned

637
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,226
before is we are both within a federated organization.

638
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:21,040
It's very large. So how do you reach everybody,

639
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,850
especially when others are going to promote your platforms?

640
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,740
That would be great.

641
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:37,906
So also we need to work more towards defining

642
00:44:37,938 --> 00:44:41,574
standards. And we are

643
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:46,006
aware that we are on a journey. And the

644
00:44:46,028 --> 00:44:49,450
environment changes, team changes, the organization changes,

645
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,374
and we are set on a journey,

646
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:55,594
and it's not one time actions that will follow.

647
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:59,922
So we are adopting a more evolutionary

648
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:03,706
model. And it's important to keep your principles

649
00:45:03,738 --> 00:45:07,694
in mind. The principles are the basis for your

650
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:12,080
guidance. And the main goal that we still have,

651
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,482
if you look one year back today or

652
00:45:16,536 --> 00:45:20,446
five years in the future, is accelerated delivery

653
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:24,098
of business value. And this is where we bring value

654
00:45:24,184 --> 00:45:28,200
to our organizations. Of course,

655
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,210
there is always the balance

656
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:35,574
between, okay, this is what we envision, this is the direction where

657
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:41,322
we want to go to. But there is also something

658
00:45:41,456 --> 00:45:43,370
that is the daily reality.

659
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,460
Things are not perfect,

660
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,766
and this means that

661
00:45:50,788 --> 00:45:54,270
you have to deal with impediments, your dependencies,

662
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,480
but it's also to keep on a focus on

663
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:06,514
your ability to adopt and what

664
00:46:06,552 --> 00:46:08,820
your customers need. And there,

665
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:14,238
it's also what we previous

666
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:18,370
touched upon this journey part. It's also part of this journey.

667
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,354
Yeah. And here again, the topic of evolution

668
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:25,400
comes in. So if you are defining a standard,

669
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,530
make sure that you not only think about right now,

670
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,386
but also how is

671
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:37,660
it going to work in future, for example, with the authorization model.

672
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:41,750
Yeah. One thing you know for sure

673
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,386
is that there will be tools in your platform phased

674
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:48,830
out and there will be different tools and they will have

675
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,926
their own access model, for example. So be aware that you

676
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:56,962
design this in such a way that you can evolve with it and

677
00:46:57,016 --> 00:47:00,994
can make your platform involve. Yeah. And also make

678
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:04,466
it as easy for your customers as possible. And that

679
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,006
is, I think the next part that we have on our slide is

680
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:12,214
really about keep improving the collaboration with your

681
00:47:12,252 --> 00:47:16,040
customers, helps them to

682
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,986
make those technical decisions together. Often our customers

683
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:25,162
are quite technical and make them part

684
00:47:25,216 --> 00:47:30,570
of the conversation that you're having and continuously

685
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,590
validate whether the technical direction

686
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:38,910
that you are going into also meets

687
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,700
what your customers can deal with. But also,

688
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,340
it's also good feedback. Maybe I need to simplify something.

689
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,690
Of course, we mentioned already a couple of times

690
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,246
before, we really need to measure when we

691
00:47:58,268 --> 00:48:01,586
are successful. So the goal is to accelerate the delivery

692
00:48:01,618 --> 00:48:05,218
of business value. I think Dora metrics

693
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:07,320
are an excellent way to do this.

694
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:12,118
But also think about, for instance,

695
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:16,300
employee engagement or net promoter score to see

696
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:20,462
if you can have the organ or see

697
00:48:20,516 --> 00:48:24,320
whether the organization can help you to scale your platform.

698
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,920
Yeah, so that's it.

699
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,526
Thanks for watching. If you

700
00:48:34,548 --> 00:48:37,070
have any questions or want to discuss further,

701
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:42,574
we're delighted to have the conversation with us with

702
00:48:42,612 --> 00:48:46,022
you. So we'll be of available in the Discord channel

703
00:48:46,076 --> 00:48:49,366
of the conference and you can also always look

00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:53,446
us up on LinkedIn and just drop us a message and

705
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:56,886
we'll discuss. All right, thanks.

706
00:48:56,988 --> 00:48:57,380
Thank you.
