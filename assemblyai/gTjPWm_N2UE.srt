1
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,870
Hey, everybody, I want to kick things off with a story. So last

2
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,562
summer, I was bugging my boss, Joe, for promotion.

3
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:38,054
So I asked him straight up, Joe, what do I need to do to get

4
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:41,670
promoted? And he said, lauren, you're doing great work,

5
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,160
but you've got to raise your profile internally at the company.

6
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,920
People need to know who you are and what you're doing.

7
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,114
And I thought, I hate

8
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:56,814
networking like I know my teammates, but getting to know

9
00:00:56,852 --> 00:01:00,000
people outside of my immediate team is really hard.

10
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,206
I'm a remote employee. I can just bump into people in the hallway

11
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:07,922
and strike up a conversation. Can't I just

12
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:11,060
put my head down, focus on my work?

13
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,238
So I called up my mentor taken, and I said,

14
00:01:17,404 --> 00:01:21,494
ken, I need a plan to raise my profile. And Ken made

15
00:01:21,532 --> 00:01:25,174
several suggestions. I did not like his suggestions because

16
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:28,614
they pushed me out of my comfort zone. And I said,

17
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:32,714
ken, I like my comfort zone, but Ken said, do it

18
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:36,074
anyway. So I did. And this

19
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:39,274
made my boss, Joe, happy because it has easy to make a case for my

20
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:42,986
promotion. And he said, lauren, you're promoted.

21
00:01:43,178 --> 00:01:46,000
Which made me do a little happy dance inside my head.

22
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,714
So this idea of raising my profile has been a theme

23
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:54,750
throughout my entire career. Early in my career as a software engineer,

24
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,302
my managers would talk to me about expanding my scope

25
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:02,226
Andor demonstrating influence both inside and outside the

26
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:05,490
company. Maybe you've heard similar things about

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,630
scope or influence or reputation.

28
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,966
Or maybe you're doing your job really well and you're like scratching youll head trying

29
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:15,350
to figure out why you're not getting promoted.

30
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,502
Doing youll job well will probably not be enough to get promoted.

31
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:23,020
And for doors to start opening for you,

32
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,050
you're going to have to put in the work to raise your profile.

33
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,006
So what do I mean by profile? I'm talking about

34
00:02:31,108 --> 00:02:34,240
what people know or remember about you.

35
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,014
Your profile consists of things like who you

36
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:41,680
are, what youll can do, and what you're known for.

37
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,598
Let's take a moment and think about your profile. So I'm

38
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:48,882
going to walk you through the pieces of my profile as an example and

39
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:52,370
give you time to jot down some notes about your profile.

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,138
So I've actually made a worksheet that you can choose to use if

41
00:02:57,144 --> 00:03:00,658
you'd like. The link for the worksheet is in the description below,

42
00:03:00,824 --> 00:03:04,326
so you can print it out and fill it in throughout this session. Or if

43
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:07,398
you don't have access to a printer, you just don't like printing anything. You can

44
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:11,420
just open up a text editor on your computer and type up your notes there.

45
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,010
So let's walk through my profile as an example.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,006
So who am I at least who am I at work?

47
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,390
Well, I'm a staff developer advocate at MongoDB.

48
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,806
Internally at my company, people also need to

49
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:31,130
know what team I'm on and what part of the organization

50
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,198
I'm in. So I'm on the Devrel team under Rita

51
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:38,642
Rodriguez. So take a moment and

52
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:42,034
jot down some notes about the basics of who you are.

53
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:45,140
Feel free to case the recording while you do so.

54
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,222
All right, next, let's talk about what I can do.

55
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,138
So these could be technical skills or soft skills.

56
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:58,486
So I enjoy building web apps using Javascript and node

57
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:02,742
js. I love helping people model data in MongoDB

58
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:07,290
and talking about schema design patterns and schema design anti patterns

59
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,310
as well as building CI CD pipelines.

60
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,070
I also can speak at conferences.

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,186
So take a moment and think about what you can do. What skills

62
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,810
do you have? What skills do you want to acquire?

63
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,290
I encourage you to pause the recording and write down some notes.

64
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,500
All right, finally, what am I known for?

65
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,502
So I'm known for creating easy to

66
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:42,040
understand and engaging articles and videos.

67
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,082
So specifically, I'm known for my node Quickstart stories,

68
00:04:46,226 --> 00:04:49,734
my anti pattern series, and my realm CI CD

69
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:52,822
series. I'm also known

70
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:56,842
for my dedication to excellence and being

71
00:04:56,896 --> 00:05:00,258
detail oriented. I'm a remote

72
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:03,790
work advocate and I've given several talks on the topic.

73
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,822
And finally, I'm also known for creating silly TikToks about

74
00:05:07,876 --> 00:05:11,598
life as a developer. So take a

75
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:15,618
moment last time for a while and write down what you're known for

76
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:19,826
internally at your company as well, has externally in

77
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:23,650
the broader tech community. Also consider

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,320
if there are things you're not currently known for but youll like to be.

79
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,030
All right, so pause the recording, write down your ideas.

80
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,706
So now you have an idea of what you want your profile or

81
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:41,146
your personal brand to be. So some of

82
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:44,522
you are probably sitting here thinking, but why do I have

83
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:49,078
to do this? Right? Isn't technology a meritocracy?

84
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:52,638
Can't my work just speak for itself? So I'm going to

85
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,078
cover four reasons why you should raise your profile, and then

86
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:59,790
I'll talk about how you're going to actually do that. So first,

87
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,630
why for a lot of software engineering roles,

88
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,250
raise your profile is part of the promotion requirements.

89
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,406
I looked at many publicly available promotion requirements for software

90
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,734
engineers, and companies have different names for promotion

91
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:18,166
requirements. Some companies will call them things like

92
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:22,790
career frameworks or career ladders or title matrixes.

93
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,486
These are the documents that tell you what you have to do to

94
00:06:26,508 --> 00:06:30,022
get promoted. So I saw a common theme

95
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:33,500
across these documents and let's take a look at three of them.

96
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,330
Patreon levels, their engineers from IC one

97
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,854
all the way up to IC six. IC standing for individual

98
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:45,486
contributor. Their career levels document has

99
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:48,826
a category specifically for influence.

100
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:52,350
So here are some of the items included in the influence category.

101
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,930
So at IC three, you're starting to broader impact.

102
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,470
IC four routinely has initiative

103
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,570
to domain level impact,

104
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,030
IC five routinely has engineering wide impact

105
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,710
and IC six routinely has.org to

106
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,326
industry level impact. So as you move

107
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:19,910
up the engineering levels, your influence is expected to increase

108
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,260
both inside and outside the company.

109
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,486
Let's take a look at medium. The medium engineering

110
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:32,334
growth rubric has a section on evangelism. They list

111
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:36,254
different levels of evangelism. So first

112
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:41,002
represents medium well externally Andor influences individuals

113
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:42,110
positively.

114
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,646
Next participates more centrally in small events

115
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,038
and takes simple actions that positively influence

116
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:52,420
groups of people.

117
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,134
Works hard to positively influence large groups of

118
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:03,666
people on their views of medium establishes

119
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:07,586
medium as a great innovative company and workplace to the

120
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:08,970
whole industry.

121
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,966
Andor introduces medium in a positive light to a wider audience

122
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,254
outside the industry. So this evangelism section

123
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:22,430
focuses primarily on external influence.

124
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,050
All right, I've got one more example for you. Khan Academy.

125
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,494
So Khan Academy's engineering career development document has

126
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:34,354
an emphasis specifically on evangelism and public

127
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,746
artifacts. I love their explanation, so I'm just going to read

128
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,834
it to you. Being open in

129
00:08:40,872 --> 00:08:44,606
sharing our work is at the heart of our development philosophy.

130
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:48,354
We work on exciting stuff, the type of stuff that energizes

131
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,440
passionate, smart people and makes them want to help in any way possible.

132
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,330
The more you blog about our work, share our progress and

133
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,002
connect with the development community, the more likely we are

134
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:04,570
to attract top talent and become an exemplary dev

135
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,818
team. This type of stuff

136
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:11,594
increases youll market value, thus justifying our

137
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:15,194
paying you more money. And when you do them as a representative of Khan

138
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:18,714
Academy, they reflect well on us establishing

139
00:09:18,762 --> 00:09:22,694
our reputation as being the kind of place where the elite

140
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,366
celebrity developers work, which in turn attracts

141
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:30,046
more great developers. Their career development document

142
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:33,666
goes on to give specific examples of the types of evangelism and

143
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:36,340
artifacts they want their engineers to create.

144
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,462
So some companies focus more on internal influence while others

145
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:44,822
focus more on external influence. But it's a fairly common

146
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,678
theme to see in the higher ranks of software engineers and developers.

147
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,106
You have to show that you are influencing others and that

148
00:09:52,128 --> 00:09:56,506
you have a growing reputation a

149
00:09:56,528 --> 00:10:00,838
lot of the time. It's also part of the implicit promotion requirements.

150
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:04,446
Now every company is different, but most of the time, your manager will

151
00:10:04,468 --> 00:10:08,618
not be able to give you a promotion on their own. At the lower levels,

152
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:12,718
your boss's boss and maybe your boss's peers need to

153
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:16,958
approve the promotion. As you get into the higher levels,

154
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:20,338
leaders across your organization and your company are going

155
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:23,426
to need to agree. The management team and

156
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:26,934
executives need to know who you are and the work

157
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:29,830
that you do in order to approve the promotion.

158
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,110
Number three, raising your profile opens doors.

159
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,610
Those doors could be things like a new role at your company,

160
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,594
or a job at another company, or a leadership opportunity,

161
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:47,594
or an invitation to speak at a conference, or a chance to build

162
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:51,326
connections with other industry leaders. As you build your

163
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,480
profile, doors will begin opening for you.

164
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,040
And finally, it attracts people to your company.

165
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,762
As Khan Academy stated in their career development doc,

166
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:06,126
engineers want to work with other amazing engineers.

167
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:10,306
When you raise your profile, other awesome engineers will want to work with

168
00:11:10,328 --> 00:11:13,202
you. If your company has referral bonuses right?

169
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,418
This is a nice monetary perk. But also this means you'll

170
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,360
get to work with other awesome people.

171
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,070
So as you're thinking about raising your profile, you want to think about both

172
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,870
internally Andor externally.

173
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,830
So internally, you want to think about working your way outward

174
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,740
from your immediate team, to your management team,

175
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,254
to your department, to the people throughout your

176
00:11:40,292 --> 00:11:43,840
company, all the way up to the executive team.

177
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,630
When you think about externally raising your profile,

178
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,470
you might start with former colleagues or classmates.

179
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,842
You might get connected with other developer, advocate your local area at

180
00:11:55,896 --> 00:11:59,346
meetups or hackathons, and you might work

181
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:03,122
to reach the global developer community either in person or

182
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:06,358
online. It's up to you if you want to focus

183
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:09,906
internally or externally. Often external

184
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:13,686
efforts will also create internal visibility has well, which is

185
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:17,754
a nice bonus. All right, so now that you know why

186
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:21,354
you should raise your profile, let's talk about ten ways you can

187
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,180
actually make that happen.

188
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,426
Number one, become the go to person for a

189
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:32,014
particular language like Python or a technology like

190
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,166
kubernetes, or a common challenge that your customers

191
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:39,246
face, be that go to person for your team or your

192
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:42,426
entire company. Dropbox specifically

193
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:45,566
calls out domain expertise in their career framework,

194
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:49,678
so they say you are the authority at Dropbox

195
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:53,522
on a particular domain. This could be a platform,

196
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:57,462
for example windows or iOS, a particular field

197
00:12:57,516 --> 00:13:01,366
of computer science, or a product category. As you

198
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:04,946
grow along the arc of being an engineer, you get deeper

199
00:13:04,978 --> 00:13:08,698
and deeper into a space or expand to having

200
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:13,130
more breadth. Impact often

201
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,666
comes through consulting quickly, unblocking thorny issues in a

202
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:20,362
domain and finding creative, generalizable approaches to

203
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:22,990
nonobvious problems in a domain.

204
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,546
So identify what you're good at either go deeper

205
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,894
or develop a wide breadth and become the go

206
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:32,480
to person for that.

207
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,190
Number two, contribute to open source projects.

208
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,314
This is a great way for other developers to see your work,

209
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:44,802
and being a contributor or a maintainer can give you a lot

210
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:48,450
of visibility. If, like me, you don't enjoy

211
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,006
coding in your off hours, see if there's a way you can code in the

212
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:55,382
open at work. Your company may also see the value

213
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,920
in contributing to open source projects or developing in the open.

214
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,066
You may also want to create a readme for your GitHub profile page to

215
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:05,420
let people know a little bit about you.

216
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,414
So Joe Carlson has a really nice 62nd tutorial

217
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:13,354
on how you can easily do this with just a markdown file. So I've

218
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:16,320
included a link here in the slides so you can watch that later.

219
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,374
Number three, report the news for youll team.

220
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:24,254
Now, there are several different ways that you can do this.

221
00:14:24,452 --> 00:14:28,062
If someone on your team needs to be a representative as part of the larger

222
00:14:28,126 --> 00:14:31,380
cross functional team, volunteer to be that person.

223
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:36,222
You'll bring status updates, but you can also become known as the person who identifies

224
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:40,200
or solves problems. As the larger team works together,

225
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,280
you can also become known as the expert on your part of the project.

226
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,146
If someone needs to report status to the executives,

227
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:51,434
this is a great way to get to know them. They'll see

228
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:55,066
your face on a regular basis. Now, if you're not

229
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:58,314
a fan of extra meetings, you can do something

230
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:01,686
like volunteer to curate an internal or external

231
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:05,454
newsletter that profile updates about your piece of the product or

232
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:09,374
the product has a whole now, I do want to caveat this

233
00:15:09,412 --> 00:15:12,942
a little bit. I want to warn you, reporting the news can become

234
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:16,242
seen as an administrative role that has less value.

235
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:19,826
So make sure that you tailor the role in a way that

236
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:23,058
gives you a lot of visibility and profile a lot of value

237
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:24,020
to others.

238
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:29,574
All right, if you want to be seen has an expert something

239
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:33,334
write about it. Even if there are other people out there who

240
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:37,094
know more about the topic than you do, if you're writing about it,

241
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:40,694
people will assume you know what you're talking about. You can write

242
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,580
about things you already know or things you are learning.

243
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,546
Writing about topics you don't already know is a great way to reinforce your

244
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:50,938
learning. Now, there are a variety of places where you can write.

245
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:54,670
Your company may have an engineering blog. You can create your own personal

246
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,094
blog. There are sites like Dev two and medium that allow

247
00:15:58,132 --> 00:16:01,470
you to write without spinning up your own blog.

248
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,366
All right, number five, give tech talks.

249
00:16:06,558 --> 00:16:09,890
These can be small lunch and learns at your company or huge

250
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,940
international conferences or anywhere in between.

251
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,906
Just like writing, people are going to assume you're an expert. If you're

252
00:16:17,938 --> 00:16:21,894
talking about a topic, I guarantee that you have something

253
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:25,458
you can talk about. Whether you're a seasoned expert or you're brand

254
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:28,860
new to coding, you have a story that you can tell.

255
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,686
Many people have a fear of public speaking. It's normal.

256
00:16:33,878 --> 00:16:37,466
Don't let that fear stop you. Start in small venues where

257
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:41,630
you feel comfortable and then take baby steps to other venues.

258
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,874
I was interviewed recently about how I got started speaking at tech conferences

259
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,714
and I shared tips for others, so I will drop

260
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:53,120
a link in the description below.

261
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,270
If you're interested in speaking about MongoDB at a conference,

262
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,826
check out the MongoDB speakers program. You can apply to work with

263
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:05,766
a speaking coach and get funding to attend the conference. There is a

264
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:09,474
link to the MongoDB speakers program in that article

265
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:11,480
that is on the screen.

266
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,000
Number six regularly post on social media.

267
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,142
Maybe you love it, or maybe you hate it, but it's hard to deny

268
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,170
that social media is a great way to raise your profile.

269
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,422
You can create short, bite sized content on platforms like Twitter,

270
00:17:28,486 --> 00:17:31,870
LinkedIn, Instagram and TikTok, or you can create

271
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,602
longer, more in depth content on Twitch,

272
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:38,970
YouTube, or podcast. Posting to all those platforms

273
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,106
might seem a bit daunting, but you can likely reuse or recycle the

274
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:47,074
same content. I joined TikTok right

275
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:50,654
after the pandemic began and I started creating short, silly TikToks

276
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,558
about life as a developer. They do okay on TikTok,

277
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:58,694
but I hesitantly started reposting the TikToks on LinkedIn and they

278
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:02,246
do surprisingly well there. I think of LinkedIn as

279
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:05,778
this know professional platform, but people seem

280
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,440
to really enjoy the silliness when it appears there.

281
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,146
What I've noticed is that I interact with a lot of the developer community on

282
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:15,820
LinkedIn who I've never met in person,

283
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,130
but I also interact with a lot of my fellow MongoDB employees

284
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,726
on LinkedIn who again, I may never talk to on

285
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:27,274
a regular basis. Posting on LinkedIn has raised

286
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:31,242
my profile both internally at MongoDB and externally

287
00:18:31,306 --> 00:18:33,040
in the broader developer community.

288
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,994
Number seven, lead an employee networking group. Now,

289
00:18:39,032 --> 00:18:42,482
companies have different names for these. I've heard them called affinity groups or business

290
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:46,470
resource groups. What I'm talking about are those groups at your company for particular

291
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,402
groups of people with a common interest. When I was at IBM,

292
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:54,882
I led the worldwide work from home group at MongoDB.

293
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:58,822
I currently participate in the women's group these groups provide

294
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:02,934
an opportunity to demonstrate leadership as well as build connections

295
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:06,742
with people across the company. At MongoDB,

296
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:09,626
our executives are involved in these groups, so it's a great way to get to

297
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,818
know an executive in a more informal setting. Now I'm

298
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:17,806
going to caveat this recommendation. Some companies really

299
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:21,150
value the work people do in leading these networking groups.

300
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,122
Bother companies see these as nice to have groups that don't provide

301
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:28,466
a lot of value to the business. So be sure that you can

302
00:19:28,488 --> 00:19:32,334
frame your work in these groups in a way that matters to your management

303
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:36,214
team. Number eight,

304
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:39,746
attend, host, or speak at a meetup

305
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:43,286
or a hackathon meetups and hackathons are a great way to

306
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,720
get connected with other people in your local community.

307
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,378
Hosting a meetup doesn't require any technical skills, but if

308
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:54,090
you execute the meetups consistently, people will see you as a leader.

309
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,666
Attending and asking thoughtful questions will also help you be

310
00:19:58,688 --> 00:20:02,314
seen as a technical leader. Hackathons are a fantastic

311
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:06,254
way to work with and get to know other developers in your area, so get

312
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,910
involved in your favorite meetup or hackathon.

313
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,514
Number nine, answer questions publicly online on

314
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:18,130
places like stack overflow or community forums.

315
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,014
If you provide thoughtful, accurate answers,

316
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:25,554
people will begin to recognize your name. When I worked

317
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,966
at IBM, I decided to answer one question a day in our

318
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:32,614
online forums. This helped our users recognized me.

319
00:20:32,812 --> 00:20:36,182
It also demonstrated to my team that I was knowledgeable and

320
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,010
helpful. All right, number taken.

321
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,420
My last tip for you today and possibly the most important

322
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,466
advertise your work. If you

323
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:50,810
have a daily scrum or a weekly status meeting,

324
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,870
show up ready to talk about what you've accomplished.

325
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,590
When you meet someone new, be ready with your elevator pitch.

326
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,358
Capture any compliments you get and make sure your management team sees

327
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:08,094
them. For example, if someone says that they enjoyed

328
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:11,554
a conference talk that I give, I will grab the link andor

329
00:21:11,592 --> 00:21:15,294
forward it to my manager. If someone gives me a compliment

330
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:18,694
verbally, I'll ask them to send it to me as an email as well,

331
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,870
so I can just forward that to my manager.

332
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:26,310
I also have a Google Doc where I keep a list of every

333
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,498
compliment that I receive. Then, when it's time for me to

334
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:33,158
write my performance review, I just organize the compliments into groups

335
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:36,300
and paste them directly into my performance review.

336
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,098
This gives my management team tangible evidence that I'm

337
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:43,934
doing my job well. If possible,

338
00:21:44,132 --> 00:21:47,694
find a manager who is good at advertising your work as

339
00:21:47,732 --> 00:21:51,466
well. I've been very fortunate that my director, my boss's

340
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:54,926
boss, acts as a sponsor for me. He speaks well

341
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:58,434
of me when I'm not in the room. If I send him a really good

342
00:21:58,472 --> 00:22:01,634
compliment, he forwards it on to his boss. This means

343
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:05,494
that the executive team isn't only hearing about me at performance review time,

344
00:22:05,612 --> 00:22:08,520
they're hearing positive things about me throughout the year.

345
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,950
All right, so those are my top ten tips for raising your profile.

346
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,378
Raising your profile will probably feel uncomfortable at first,

347
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:20,650
and that's okay. That's normal.

348
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,854
I encourage you to make a plan, take baby

349
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:27,610
steps as you step out of your comfort zone.

350
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,782
So consider, what can you do this

351
00:22:32,836 --> 00:22:36,400
week, this month, and this year?

352
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,730
I encourage you to write down a specific action

353
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:43,650
youll can take to acquire a new skill,

354
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,970
modify what you're known for, or raise your profile.

355
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,506
So I've got spots for you on page two of the worksheet to do

356
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:54,446
just that. For each action,

357
00:22:54,638 --> 00:22:56,820
consider how you will evaluate success.

358
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,546
How will you know if you've followed through on that action?

359
00:23:00,738 --> 00:23:04,006
How will you know if the action worked? How will you know if you got

360
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:05,350
that desired outcome?

361
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,310
Also consider how you will hold yourself accountable.

362
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,220
What I like to do is set a calendar reminder to check in with myself.

363
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,690
Maybe youll can ask a friend to hold you accountable.

364
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,754
What can you do to keep these actions that you're going to write down

365
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:25,626
from just sitting here on the paper or sitting there in youll text file

366
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:29,422
and making sure that you follow through? So in just a moment,

367
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:32,606
I'm going to give you a minute to think about this. Now,

368
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:35,890
before I do that, let me remind you of the tips for raise your profile.

369
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:41,026
Number one, become the Goto person. Number two,

370
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,290

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,280

00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,150

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:55,350

00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,942
a meetup or hackathon. Number nine,

378
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,942

00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:17,280
ten, advertise your work.

380
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,486
So as you're thinking about what you can do, be specific.

381
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:24,878
If you can. If you want to become the go to person,

382
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:28,846
what do you want to become the go to person for? All right,

383
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:32,046
so I'm going to give you just a minute. If you want to pause the

384
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:35,494
recording and taken your plan, what can you this week,

385
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:38,582
this month, this year, how are you going to evaluate success

386
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:40,950
and how will you hold yourself accountable?

387
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,280
All right, I hope you've made a plan.

388
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,186
You've got your plan. You're ready to start taking small steps

389
00:24:51,218 --> 00:24:54,870
to raise your profile. I cannot wait to hear about you

390
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,700
in the coming weeks and months. You've got this.
