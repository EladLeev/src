00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,166
Hello, everybody. I'm Sam Samuel from Cisco Systems. I'm here

2
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,266
to give you a talk on quantum communication challenges in scaling quantum

3
00:00:24,298 --> 00:00:27,602
computers. This is a general talk. It'll cover a fair amount of ground.

4
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:31,366
It'll go from basic quantum computing and how

5
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:33,800
we can apply it in a variety of ways,

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,430
whether it has poses threats for the way we currently use

7
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,734
classical networks, and whether the same principles used in quantum computing

8
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:47,414
can be applied to quantum communication, and whether that would be a beneficial

9
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:50,954
direction to go in. And we eventually look at the problems that if we choose

10
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:54,382
to go that direction, we will face. And these, of course, give you an idea

11
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:58,462
of what the situation could be, or how the

12
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,930
ability or the interaction between quantum computing and quantum

13
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:05,710
communication can lead to it in the future

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,518
and give you some idea of what that would be. So it's

15
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:13,266
a longish talk, hopefully be interesting for you, and so we'll dive right in.

16
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:17,322
So the first question we really want to ask is, why is it that there's

17
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:20,280
a fair amount of interest in quantum computing today?

18
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,646
And I guess the best way of answering that right

19
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,830
now is to sort of look at the investment levels from

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,146
the venture community, investment community into quantum technologies of any

21
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:34,954
sort. And this chart here shows us that there's an increasing amount of

22
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:39,498
investment going into this particular area. The total investment is over a billion dollars now,

23
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:43,274
although this chart here is over two years old. So I'm assuming that

24
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:47,006
the total modes investment is well beyond a billion and a half dollars that we

25
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:49,866
managed to count in this particular chart.

26
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,290
And that investment is spread over three things. It's spread over quantum computing,

27
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,270
and it's spread over quantum software.

28
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,694
And then it also includes quantum communication and quantum

29
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:05,860
Internet type things. It seems natural that the way that

30
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,750
the investment is spread is kind of weighted towards

31
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,494
quantum computing, because without that, none of the other two really kind of make

32
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:17,974
sense. And it's kind of easy to see that without

33
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,706
a quantum computer having quantum software to run, then it

34
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,354
won't be at all useful. So my

35
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:28,986
interest is more to do with the quantum communication and quantum Internet side

36
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:32,266
of things. And this talk will look at that particular area and more

37
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:36,666
interest. But the point is, all aspects of quantum computing

38
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,414
or quantum technology are being investigated, invested in recently. And this

39
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,926
talk is trying to give you an idea of where we are in the state

40
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:46,082
of all of that, really. So with that in mind,

41
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:49,646
then, the first question we have to ask is, what is quantum

42
00:02:49,678 --> 00:02:53,502
computing? Quantum computing is very different from classical computing.

43
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:57,006
In classical computing, we're quite used to dealing with bits

44
00:02:57,118 --> 00:03:00,930
a bit is zero or one. In quantum computing,

45
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,358
we are dealing with a quantum bit, a qubit. And a

46
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:07,850
qubit is different from a classical bit in the sense that

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,940
it has the superposition of zero and one,

48
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,606
meaning that the same bit represents zero and one simultaneously.

49
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:18,842
And if we have a register of two

50
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:22,326
bits, and that register will then represent,

51
00:03:22,438 --> 00:03:25,518
because of superposition, all possible combinations of

52
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:29,326
terms and ones in that register. So, in other words, it has

53
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:32,834
the entire gamut of all possibilities, these in one

54
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:36,526
throw, if you will. The other thing that quantum computing

55
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:39,314
uses an awful lot is entanglement. So,

56
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,694
entanglement, in this case is where two particles

57
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:47,506
are highly correlated, and it's very difficult to break apart

58
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:51,506
an individual state between two particles that are entangled.

59
00:03:51,618 --> 00:03:55,366
So when it's difficult to break apart the state,

60
00:03:55,548 --> 00:03:58,962
then that means that the states are pretty much highly correlated,

61
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:02,374
that we can't divide them apart.

62
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:06,170
So it becomes very difficult for us to look into a quantum system

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,494
and get a definite answer out of it. And entanglement

64
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:12,478
is the means behind which it makes it very difficult for us to go in

65
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:15,854
and inspect an individual particle. We have to sort of

66
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:20,490
look holistically at the overall system. Quantum computing

67
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,258
works off quantum circuits that are probabilistic in

68
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,330
nature. So, in contrast to classical networking,

69
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,766
classical networkings tend to be very network circuit,

70
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:34,670
sorry, quantum circuits, as opposed

71
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,570
CTO classical circuits.

72
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,454
Classical circuits tend to be very deterministic in nature,

73
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:45,414
that you apply the same computation to it, you get the same answer

74
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:48,634
in quantum circuits. That may not necessarily be the case.

75
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:50,890
The outcome is very probabilistic in nature.

76
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,410
So these three things,

77
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,010
superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic computation,

78
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,720
come together when we do quantum computing. And the final

79
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,054
figure in this particular slide shows that

80
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:13,178
a classical circuit takes a predefined path through

81
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:16,306
a computational, rather sequential, not predefined, because I

82
00:05:16,328 --> 00:05:19,762
know you can do conditional statements inside a program.

83
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:23,570
But the point is that it's a very sequential way

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,218
that the program executes, whereas in a quantum

85
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:30,754
system, it's very different because of superposition,

86
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:34,086
we're able to explore the entirety of the state space of the

87
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:38,054
problem that the algorithm is addressing. And in so doing,

88
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:41,178
as we explore the entirety of the state space, we can then come to a

89
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:44,598
resolution of the answer quite quicker,

90
00:05:44,774 --> 00:05:48,826
more effectively than we could do otherwise. And that's the

91
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,606
benefit that quantum computing brings. So how

92
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,646
can we apply that? And so the next few slides look at what

93
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:58,240
the possible implications are of having such a computer.

94
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,606
So a computer that's able to explore the

95
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,114
entirety of state space kind of changes, the way we

96
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:09,858
look at the potency of calculations that such a computer would have.

97
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:13,426
So this slide here has a table on it, and the

98
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:17,282
table kind of indicates the generations that a particular

99
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:20,854
technology would have. So operations zero, one through all the way to n.

100
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:24,726
We're quite used to measuring the potency of calculations in

101
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:28,026
a silicon based system, a classical based system, through Moore's law. So in

102
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:31,900
other words, we expect every 18 months or so for

103
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,566
a silicon based processor to double in its potency

104
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:40,750
over time. And that's what the top line of

105
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,360
this particular table shows.

106
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,586
The second line, the double exponential line, is showing

107
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:52,174
something called Nevin's law. So Nevin's law is

108
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:56,594
different from Moore's law in the sense that it's a double exponential rise in

109
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,686
potency. So it has a different sequence. So it's

110
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:04,082
not a case of doubling every generation. It's a case

111
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:08,834
of double doubling every generation. So rather than 1248,

112
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:11,926
we have 2416, 256. So we can

113
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,046
see that if we have a computer which has that kind

114
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:18,838
of potency or that kind of doubling law associated with it,

115
00:07:18,924 --> 00:07:22,426
then it can be very potent, become very potent in

116
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:26,614
a short number of generations. These double exponential

117
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:29,462
law was discovered by a guy called Hartman.

118
00:07:29,526 --> 00:07:33,446
Nevin and Hartman realized that in his experiments, in order to

119
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:37,006
prove the potency of the quantum computer that he had, he had

120
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:40,174
to go and check it against a classical computer. And these

121
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:43,666
classical computers were running out of potency far faster than he

122
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:46,980
expected. When he looked into it, it was a double exponential law.

123
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,834
Now, the interesting thing with that is

124
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:55,602
that if you have algorithms, such as factorization

125
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,330
algorithms, which can be optimized for quantum computers,

126
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,602
then you start to see the potential that this kind of computation

127
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:07,110
has versus classical computation. And if you have

128
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,406
a means of factorizing numbers very,

129
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:14,022
very quickly, then you have a means of actually breaking ciphers in classical networks,

130
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:18,620
which is what we're going to show in the next slide. So if we have

131
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,642
a quantum computer that has a double

132
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:26,814
exponential rise in its potency in the number

133
00:08:26,852 --> 00:08:29,920
of qubits it's able to employ against a problem,

134
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,002
then one of those problems could be the factorization of

135
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:38,098
keys in a network. And so if we apply

136
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,678
that to the current cipher

137
00:08:41,774 --> 00:08:45,510
algorithms that are in networks today, we can see that a

138
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,350
quantum computer has the potential to break the cipher

139
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,674
of certain key lengths. And this is what this chart is showing.

140
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:59,206
And it also shows that there comes a point when Nevin's

141
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:03,350
law starts to accelerate the potential

142
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,638
for a quantity computer to break the ciphering in current networks.

143
00:09:07,734 --> 00:09:11,920
Now, this may seem a little bit

144
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,006
down in the sense that, oh, the world will collapse. That's not,

145
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:20,394
strictly speaking true, because, of course, the very clever people at NIST

146
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:24,258
have run competitions to ensure that we are slightly ahead of

147
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:28,366
the curve in terms of the new quantum ciphering,

148
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:32,610
or post quantum rtography, rather, that would be applied to combat these techniques.

149
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,790
In terms of computation. Though, if we go to the next slide,

150
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,418
we really have to realize that the certain kinds

151
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:44,230
of algorithms are more suited to breaking certain

152
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,374
kinds of key. So keys which are

153
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:52,186
PKI in nature are impacted by Shaw's algorithm keys, which are

154
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:57,446
more symmetric in nature. Symmetric ciphering that's going on cannot

155
00:09:57,478 --> 00:10:00,746
be addressed as easily by Shore's algorithm. They can be addressed by a different algorithm

156
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,970
called Grover's algorithm. And these algorithms are not as effective

157
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,810
in breaking longer and longer keys.

158
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,778
And so that's what this chart shows. So, long story short,

159
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:15,934
as the potency of quantum computers increases,

160
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:19,634
then the likelihood of a quantum computer

161
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,902
being able to break ciphering of current networking

162
00:10:23,966 --> 00:10:27,906
starts to go up. But that data isn't necessarily being

163
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:31,618
broken on the fly. It's because the data has been siphoned

164
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:35,378
off from the network and is stored somewhere where a bad actor

165
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:38,774
can take his time over trying to break the key if he has a quantum

166
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:42,106
computer at his disposal. So that's one

167
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,410
application of quantum computers.

168
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,542
But of course, we can apply quantum computing in different directions,

169
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:53,514
and there are other sorts of very complex

170
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:57,520
problems that need solving, and there are other np hard problems out there

171
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,718
that are in need of the attention of something like a quantum computer.

172
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:06,018
And so we would like to be able to

173
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:09,538
increase the potency of the computers that address that particular problem.

174
00:11:09,624 --> 00:11:13,474
So it becomes natural to state the following obvious point,

175
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:18,066
that you can always make a more powerful computer by joining

176
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:22,114
more powerful computers together. And this is also true for quantum computing.

177
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:25,622
So if we're able to join quantum computers together to make

178
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:29,558
a larger quantum computer, then we can solve more complex problems

179
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:32,700
more effectively and probably quicker as well.

180
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,666
So I want to turn this talk really now onto how

181
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:40,286
we would do that, how we would try and join computers together. But before

182
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:43,280
we do that, it's probably worth exploring what we mean by this.

183
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,280
So the idea of having

184
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,454
a parallel execution path in a program has been out there for quite some

185
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:57,266
time. So back when I was at university in the late 1980s,

186
00:11:57,288 --> 00:12:00,786
early 1990s, there was an awful lot of work going on

187
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:04,914
in parallel computing. So we were able to get an application,

188
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:08,466
break the application down into a set of parallel chunks, and then try and speed

189
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:12,566
up the computation by applying the parallelism to that particular application

190
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:16,438
or the algorithm that we're looking at, we want

191
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,346
to do it slightly differently for quantum computing.

192
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:23,354
And the reason for it is that not

193
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:26,842
all quantum computers are good at solving every single problem.

194
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:29,418
In other words, there's no such thing as a general quantum computer.

195
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:33,486
Yet these computers tend to be very specialized and look at

196
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:37,294
either annealing like problems or optimization like problems, or they're very

197
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:40,846
good at factorizing, but not necessarily a mixture of both.

198
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:44,226
Of course, over time, the situation may actually change.

199
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:48,354
But it's important for us to understand that not only as

200
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:52,386
we present an application or

201
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:56,114
a program to a network, we want to make sure that that application is broken

202
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:59,574
down and distributed to the appropriate quantum computer. So that's another

203
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,866
reason why we would like to have networking involved

204
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:04,870
in this kind of evolution.

205
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,610
So in order for us to communicate,

206
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,314
it's probably worth reexamining some of the principles that we

207
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:17,418
looked at in terms of quantum computing and apply them here a

208
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:20,966
little bit more. We obviously want to

209
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,826
ensure that a network is secure. So if we're able to communicate,

210
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:28,702
and we want to make sure that the network is itself not

211
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:32,318
able to be eavesdropped. Interestingly enough,

212
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:35,650
if we're working in terms of quantum state and entanglement,

213
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:40,062
it's impossible to clone an unknown

214
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:43,698
quantum state. In other words, we cannot copy quantum state if we don't know what

215
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:48,326
these quantum state is. So that kind of makes the

216
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:51,634
prospect of having a secure quantum

217
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:54,070
network in the future kind of appealing.

218
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,570
If we were able to take advantage of this particular theorem, the no cloning theorem,

219
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,770
communication would also require entanglement. So we mentioned

220
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,142
entanglement in the past, very briefly, in passing.

221
00:14:07,206 --> 00:14:11,178
It's the same entanglement here. And this is where essentially

222
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:15,386
two particles have overlapping

223
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:18,878
wave functions. And as a result of the overlapping nature of the

224
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:22,286
wave functions, then these is impossible for us

225
00:14:22,308 --> 00:14:25,406
to distinguish the individual state of each particle,

226
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:29,294
and therefore the states are entangled. These interesting thing behind that entanglement

227
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:32,882
is that, and we probably heard this

228
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:37,014
in the popular scientific press, as Einstein's spooky action in these distance is

229
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:41,974
that if we apply or

230
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,426
we influence one of the entangled particles,

231
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:49,334
the other entangled particle almost responds immediately. And so you

232
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:52,794
get something, a situation like this, whereas we apply a force on one,

233
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:56,474
the other one responds. Now, at this point,

234
00:14:56,592 --> 00:14:59,786
people tend to get a bit confused and say, well, that's breaking the

235
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:01,946
laws of the speed of light and so on and so forth. And that's not,

236
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,166
strictly speaking true, because for us to understand the

237
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:08,794
impact of that, we have to take a measurement of the particle, send that measurement

238
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:12,362
over CTO, the destination or the other half of the entangled pair,

239
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:15,614
and then recover what the message was. And so, at that point,

240
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:18,418
it all slows down to the speed of light, or slightly below the speed of

241
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:21,666
light. So we don't actually break any laws of physics here, even though it can

242
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:25,380
be an interesting thing to try and prove CTO yourself, that's not happening.

243
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,862
So, 2d concepts here.

244
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:33,670
And then the question then becomes, can we use at least

245
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,982
the entanglement to be able to communicate over

246
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,170
a distance? And this is where teleportation come in.

247
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,882
So, teleportation, at its very essence, is that we have

248
00:15:43,936 --> 00:15:47,466
an entangled pair. So we have managed to overlap the

249
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:51,274
wave functions of two photons. Say we've distributed them to the end of a communication

250
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:55,194
link, and now we want to introduce to that communication

251
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:59,054
link a particle that

252
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:02,494
has state on it, and we want to transmit that state across

253
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:06,146
the network. So, how do we do that? So, at the bottom of

254
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:09,858
this slide here, we have this qubit, this matter qubit that we

255
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:13,682
wish to transmit across the network. We need to entangle that matter

256
00:16:13,736 --> 00:16:17,446
qubit with the communication qubit on the left hand side

257
00:16:17,468 --> 00:16:23,366
of the chart here. So, in order to do that, we take a

258
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:26,930
bell state measurement of the interaction between the two particles.

259
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,970
That produces a measurement result. We send that measurement result over

260
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,746
to the counterpart pair of the

261
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:38,614
entangled pair at the other end of the communication link. We apply a localized

262
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:43,146
operation to it, and then that localized operation recovers

263
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:47,038
what the original matter qubit was as it entered the system.

264
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:50,494
And we get these teleported qubit materializing at the far

265
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:53,798
end of it. So we've not actually transmitted the state across the network

266
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:57,250
at all. And hence, that's why it teleports itself.

267
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,598
And so we have a mechanism, fundamentally, that we can use for communication

268
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:05,562
across any kind of distance, and that's teleportation.

269
00:17:05,726 --> 00:17:08,840
Now, in order to make teleportation work,

270
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,774
we really need to extend how we do these

271
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:16,630
teleportation, and we do that by successively

272
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:21,034
swapping entanglement on a communication link. So, here we

273
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:24,250
have three maximum entangled pair segments,

274
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,826
pair a, pair b, pair c, and what we're going to do

275
00:17:28,928 --> 00:17:32,666
is entangle pair a with pair b and have an

276
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:36,014
entanglement between a and b, and then do the same again to get entanglement between

277
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:39,342
c. And then we have an entanglement end to end entanglement across the entire

278
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:43,358
link. So, in order to do that we apply the same principles we

279
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:47,054
did in the previous slide. In other words, we do an entanglement

280
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:51,154
swapping measurement between the far pair of

281
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:55,006
a and the near pair of b. We send that measurement to the far pair

282
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,062
of b. We do a local operation on it. And then that means that a

283
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:02,486
and B, or the near pair of a and the far pair of B,

284
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:06,870
are now entangled. And these we perform the same measurement again between

285
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,130
the far pair of B and the near pair of C. We do an entanglement

286
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,674
swapping measurement there. We send the measurement result over

287
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:18,826
to the far end of C. We do a local operation there.

288
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:22,378
And these, as a result of that, we have entanglement between a and C.

289
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:26,446
So, to communicate now over that entirety of that link, we present the

290
00:18:26,468 --> 00:18:30,574
matter qubit to a, and we do the same performance again.

291
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,834
We take a bell of state measurement of the result of that

292
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:38,434
interaction, and we send that over to c, and we recover at

293
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:41,890
c by doing a local operation,

294
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,326
the original matter cupid that was presented at a. So that's how

295
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:49,494
we would extend distance on

296
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:53,080
such a system. The interesting thing is,

297
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,326
while it appears that we have the answer in our hands, the truth of

298
00:18:58,348 --> 00:19:03,254
the matter is that in order for us to be able to entangle

299
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:07,162
over a distance, we realize there's a limit to how far

300
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:10,140
we can send an entangled pair and get away with.

301
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,762
Rather. I think, quite honestly, my interest in quantum

302
00:19:16,826 --> 00:19:20,158
communication was actually through reading this particular paper here that I'm

303
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:24,014
quoting by Suraf Kumar, and he

304
00:19:24,052 --> 00:19:28,366
kind of indicated that in order for us to generate

305
00:19:28,398 --> 00:19:31,678
entanglement at a certain rate, that rate will only propagate

306
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:35,810
a certain distance. So that means we have to be able to regenerate

307
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,806
entanglement if we wish to communicate over larger and

308
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:44,406
larger distances. So this brings the idea of a

309
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:48,934
quantum regenerator. So, in order for us to increase distance,

310
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,730
to increase the distance over which we're able to teleport these, we have to chain

311
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,726
successive segments together, and we do that chaining with quantum

312
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:59,900
regenerators. Now,

313
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,854
that's well and good, but that's kind of like a point to point thing.

314
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:08,062
And really, we want to get to a network where we're able to direct how

315
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:11,966
and where the entanglement goes. So we're able to pick out

316
00:20:12,068 --> 00:20:16,066
a source and a destination at will and ensure that the

317
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,900
source and destination are entangled. And in order to do that,

318
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,750
we need to be able to have at our disposal

319
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,562
an adequate distribution rate of entanglement. In other words,

320
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:30,418
if we have successful communication, we have to be able to ensure we keep distributing

321
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:34,066
the entanglement to the ends, and therefore, we're able to do this module transportation

322
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:37,286
that we mentioned in the previous slide. But also the

323
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:40,626
swapping is also a means of us being able to route entanglement

324
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:44,630
around the network. And that's kind of the critical thing, although it overlooks

325
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,818
the fact I've not mentioned it specifically here. But quantum memory starts to play a

326
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:51,586
very important part in that type of activity

327
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:55,594
inside a network. So if we're able to generate

328
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:59,146
entanglement at a sufficiently high enough rate, commensurate with the communication

329
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:02,826
needs of a quantum network, and we're able to do entanglement

330
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:06,382
swapping in memory, then we're able to manipulate

331
00:21:06,446 --> 00:21:10,078
entanglement around a network, and we're able to target a source and a sync.

332
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:13,300
So that's what this slide is basically saying.

333
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,826
So what are the challenges associated with that? Well, the challenges

334
00:21:17,938 --> 00:21:21,506
are essentially twofold. There are qubit

335
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:24,434
challenges, and then there are networking challenges.

336
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:28,258
I'll address the qubit challenges first, because we are dealing

337
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:31,974
with particles, and these particles are very fragile

338
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:35,350
in nature in the sense that they start to interact with their environment,

339
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:38,714
or they're able to interact with their environment quite

340
00:21:38,752 --> 00:21:41,898
easily. So as a result, there's going to

341
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:44,970
be errors in the way that these qubits behave.

342
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,046
And that's not unnatural, of course.

343
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:51,854
So that means that if we don't have the right

344
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:55,474
interactions when we set up the quantum circuit, then that means we're going to have

345
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:59,086
programming errors in initiating the states. And that's

346
00:21:59,198 --> 00:22:02,818
one set of challenges that we're going cto face. In other words,

347
00:22:02,984 --> 00:22:07,046
how faithfully can we program something these the

348
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:10,358
qubits themselves are likely to interact with the environment that

349
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:14,630
they're in, causing decoherence between the entangled particles.

350
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,654
And that's actually quite an important one in the sense that

351
00:22:19,852 --> 00:22:23,034
we have to be very careful how we design these circuits to ensure that we

352
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:26,278
minimize that kind of exterior influence onto

353
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:29,290
the qubits that form part of the circuit.

354
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,146
And that usually means we have to reduce

355
00:22:34,278 --> 00:22:37,850
these noise in the circuit by actually reducing the temperature of the circuit. And that's

356
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,910
something which we'll come to in a minute.

357
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,990
But at least for communications, we communicate a photon,

358
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,370
and photons tend to be very much at root temperatures. So that's not necessarily a

359
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,778
problem for quantum communications, but they are a problem if you

360
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:55,220
want to go from quantum, a photon for communication into

361
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:00,040
a matter qubit for storage and memory, say. And so there's a problem there.

362
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,750
These particles that we're dealing with these qubits that we're dealing with have

363
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,880
a lifetime, a shelf life, if you will.

364
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,262
They don't necessarily last forever.

365
00:23:12,326 --> 00:23:15,818
In fact, they don't. The coherence times that

366
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:19,466
we're seeing, in other words, the time at which we can guarantee the

367
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:23,920
entanglement is not necessarily a long time.

368
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,158
Obviously, the techniques are improving, and material size is improving all the time,

369
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:31,726
and we can extend the lifetime of the coherence that these

370
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:35,386
entangled particles have. But the fact of the matter is, they have a shelf life,

371
00:23:35,428 --> 00:23:39,086
and we have to ensure that all operations are done before the shelf life expires,

372
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:42,578
if you will. The other sorts of problems that

373
00:23:42,584 --> 00:23:45,806
we have at this level are operation error.

374
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:49,038
So is the

375
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:52,806
gate, or is the device faithfully acting on

376
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:56,214
the qubit in the way we expect it to be? And again, because of the

377
00:23:56,252 --> 00:23:59,958
interaction with the environment, that may necessarily be the truth, not because it doesn't want

378
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:03,498
to behave properly. It's because that's the way physics works at that level.

379
00:24:03,664 --> 00:24:07,286
And then there are other issues as well with communication

380
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:10,074
qubits that are well known and have been known for some time, and that is

381
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:13,486
that photons can be absorbed by the fiber that they're traveling down.

382
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:16,862
And so we're going to get photon losses. And that can

383
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,120
also mean that we are losing state.

384
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,514
And if we lose one half of entangled pair,

385
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,778
then essentially we have a problem because we don't have an entangled pair anymore,

386
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,846
and we have to go and regenerate and so on and so forth. That causes

387
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:32,834
problems. Now, these are the kinds of challenges that we face

388
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:36,102
at the qubit level, but it's also important

389
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:39,670
to know that we're looking

390
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,754
at the health of that qubit,

391
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:46,662
too. The health of entanglement that that qubit has. And that's usually

392
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:49,994
referred to in terms of fidelity. And fidelity is a measure between zero and one

393
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:53,500
that sort of indicates how good something is,

394
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,882
how accurate, or how

395
00:24:57,936 --> 00:25:02,218
well matched the

396
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:05,440
integral qubits happen to be. And so

397
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,486
it's not only that we have these errors, but we also have

398
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,906
to make sure that before we start any of these operations,

399
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:16,254
the qubit that we're presenting, CTO, the system, has a high fidelity

400
00:25:16,302 --> 00:25:19,634
to it as well. So that's another issue that we have to try and cover

401
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:23,534
and produce mechanisms to ensure that we have high fidelity qubits

402
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:27,170
available to us. So these are the qubit challenges

403
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,994
from a networking perspective, there are a different set of challenges,

404
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:34,326
one we've kind of covered already, which is in order for us to

405
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:38,482
do communications? Well, we have to have qubits,

406
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:42,058
photon photonic qubits, that have high fidelity and

407
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:45,542
high purity. So if we're going to pass them through successive

408
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:48,422
gates, or if we're going to send them over any distance,

409
00:25:48,566 --> 00:25:51,806
we really have to ensure that they're very healthy before they start their

410
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:54,640
journey. And that's what this high fidelity impurity really means.

411
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,902
We also want techniques available to us that allow

412
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:04,002
us to compensate for loss and

413
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:07,518
decoherence. And one of those techniques is quantum

414
00:26:07,534 --> 00:26:10,674
error correction. If we're able to get good

415
00:26:10,712 --> 00:26:13,550
quantum error correction and that prospect against decoherence,

416
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,946
it also protects

417
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:20,920
against quantum noise. But the problem here is that

418
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,074
quantum error correction requires us to have many more qubits

419
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:28,274
available to us, and so the overall population has to increase

420
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:32,266
in order for us to take advantage of that. So that generation of qubits that

421
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:35,098
we had before starts to play a more important part if we wish to go

422
00:26:35,104 --> 00:26:38,822
down this quantum error correcting route. Network synchronization

423
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:42,282
is also another problem that we have to have.

424
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:45,994
We have synchronization in networks today, but these level of synchronization

425
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:49,610
that we're after is far tighter than we have in current networks,

426
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,534
and it needs to be tight, because we have to ensure that when we

427
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:57,742
generate entanglement, that the wave functions, we can measure accurately

428
00:26:57,886 --> 00:27:02,078
or determine accurately when particles are entangled.

429
00:27:02,174 --> 00:27:04,978
And that requires us to have a high degree of precision in the timing of

430
00:27:04,984 --> 00:27:10,150
the network. And so also

431
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,606
the lifetime of the qubit starts at the

432
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:17,094
moment it's entangled. And so we have to know how much

433
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:20,426
longer we have left on some of these, on these qubits in order for

434
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,754
us to complete the operations that we need within the specified amount of time.

435
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:28,266
So it kind of starts to impact these way we schedule, as well as

436
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:31,520
well as acknowledging the overall health

437
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,486
through having an accurate measure of decoherence time on

438
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:38,350
such particles as well. So those are the network challenges.

439
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,000
So, is there a pragmatic way forward here?

440
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,194
Interestingly enough, there is a paper that came out in

441
00:27:46,232 --> 00:27:49,534
2016 by Saramin

442
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:52,946
Marlutheran. I hope I pronounced his name

443
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:56,600
correctly, but he and his colleagues produced an excellent paper

444
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,026
that indicated that there's a generational shift.

445
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:04,614
And being engineers and scientists, of course, we magically christened these

446
00:28:04,652 --> 00:28:08,330
1st, second and third generations, which is quite novel of us.

447
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,238
But the point is that each generation starts

448
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:16,954
to improve the efficacy of

449
00:28:16,992 --> 00:28:20,570
the overall system by introducing quantum error correction

450
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,302
in two directions. Either it's used

451
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:28,106
to compensate for loss, or it's used to compensate

452
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:31,806
for error, operational error. So focus on

453
00:28:31,828 --> 00:28:35,326
loss and operational error, and depending on how we apply, it depends on

454
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:38,254
which one of these generations you have to be. So, to put it into perspective.

455
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:41,618
So even though the paper was written in 2016, where are we today?

456
00:28:41,784 --> 00:28:45,534
Today we are still scratching around at the first generation quantum repeaters,

457
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:48,854
which means that we still have a very long way to go before we get

458
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:52,086
to second and third operations, where we have a lot more

459
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:55,474
reliability into the overall communication

460
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:59,354
system. But the

461
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:02,538
community, the academic community,

462
00:29:02,624 --> 00:29:06,266
and also the startup community are starting to address these problems, and this is

463
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,610
starting to produce some results that I think are

464
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,358
looking good for how quantum networking will

465
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:15,120
evolve over the next few years or so.

466
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,302
We know that there's a roadmap, if you will,

467
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:24,018
in terms of generational shifts for a quantum repeater that we need in order to

468
00:29:24,024 --> 00:29:26,290
endtoend distance over which we can communicate.

469
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,994
That means that the prospect in the future is kind of interesting for us

470
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:36,078
to keep plowing on in this particular direction.

471
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:39,540
And if we do plow on and we're able to solve these problems,

472
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,954
then the prospect of getting to a quantum Internet starts to look kind of appealing.

473
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,774
Now, I need to put this into context. To get to a quantum Internet is

474
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:50,166
not like, oh, we solve something tomorrow, and then in two

475
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,722
years time we'll have a viable commercial product

476
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:57,114
that you can go and buy, put into your network. Everything's great. It's not quite

477
00:29:57,152 --> 00:30:00,318
like that. I think we are talking maybe ten years or so before we start

478
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:04,382
to get to a reliable network at

479
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:08,394
reasonable entanglement rates that can start to teleport

480
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:11,774
at reasonable rates. Then after

481
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,594
that, there's going to be a few years of development before we get CTO,

482
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:18,366
a quantum Internet where we can teleport with high fidelity

483
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:22,462
over any indicated

484
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:25,218
pair that wish to communicate over such a network can do so.

485
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:29,160
So it's a long way to go for that, but we understand

486
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,206
the processes around it. We understand the sorts of architectures that

487
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:36,358
may evolve to cost effectively address that area, which is

488
00:30:36,364 --> 00:30:40,074
all good news. And the technology and

489
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:43,514
the progress being made by various starts and very academic bodies are moving

490
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:50,218
along at a feral pace, which kind of gives me hope

491
00:30:50,304 --> 00:30:53,402
that we should be able to do this in a reasonable amount of time.

492
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:56,526
Reasonable here, being an ex wireless guy, I tend to think in

493
00:30:56,548 --> 00:31:00,138
ten year generational shift. So ten years or so, I think we should see staggering

494
00:31:00,154 --> 00:31:04,062
progress from where we are today. So, wrapping things up.

495
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,906
So what's the possible end state and problems if

496
00:31:07,928 --> 00:31:11,426
we solve them, or problems yet to be solved? If we carry on down this

497
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:14,702
path, what would this idealized future look like? So these diagram,

498
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:18,486
this stick diagram here that I drew kind of indicates where I think these is

499
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:22,790
going. And some of the problems that I've mentioned in

500
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,646
the qubit network are not necessarily the problems I'm mentioning here.

501
00:31:26,748 --> 00:31:30,106
So an idealized future is something like this, that we

502
00:31:30,128 --> 00:31:33,434
have a person who is interested in

503
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:36,060
writing a program for a very complex problem.

504
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:41,290
So he writes, this program. This program does not necessarily

505
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,230
have any knowledge of quantum networking in it whatsoever.

506
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,466
The program, or the application is then presented to a virtualized quantum

507
00:31:51,498 --> 00:31:55,586
data center. Right? And the first

508
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:59,026
thing that this realized quantum data center modes is it breaks down

509
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:02,446
that program, these application, and it compiles

510
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:06,198
it and manages it such that it then breaks it down into these components that

511
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:09,714
are required by the classical computing

512
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:13,800
to work on that particular program, and also break down

513
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,994
the applicable parts of that particular program that are

514
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:20,380
requiring the attention of a quantum computer.

515
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,790
So that compilation is one problem area that needs to be solved.

516
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,566
How can I universally interpret programs

517
00:32:28,678 --> 00:32:32,518
for classical quantum communication? These mix of them, if we're

518
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:36,286
able to break it down, then the next natural thing is I need to be

519
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:40,062
able to do the networking between quantum computers inside

520
00:32:40,116 --> 00:32:43,040
the same data center. That's like a very different.

521
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,886
Well, I wouldn't say it's very different. It is networking, but it's

522
00:32:47,918 --> 00:32:51,186
probably a very different networking, as we can use direct transmission between these

523
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:54,974
machines, more than likely. But the point is, as we try to extend

524
00:32:55,022 --> 00:32:58,546
distance, there's more than likely a

525
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:02,038
knee point in the behavior that requires us to change from one kind of

526
00:33:02,044 --> 00:33:05,126
network into a different kind of network, and which brings in the second problem that

527
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:08,714
we have, and that is to find a cost

528
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:12,566
effective way extending the rate and range of a which quantum

529
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:15,718
communication can take place. So that's the, if I'm

530
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:19,594
able to extend the range of a which

531
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:23,034
I can get quantum computers to talk cto each other, that means I

532
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:26,766
can then extend the number of quantum computers that talk to each other, and then

533
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:29,290
I get a more quantum powerful quantum computer, and so on and so forth,

534
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,022
which is the aim of that one. The final

535
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:35,858
one is, and I think this is the one that's going to.

536
00:33:36,024 --> 00:33:38,894
Well, actually, I think a lot of these things are going to employ my colleagues

537
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:43,426
for a very long time. But the

538
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:47,702
final problem that's left these is how

539
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:51,846
can quantum data centers be virtualized in

540
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:55,686
terms of resource and the management of those resources? And so

541
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:59,702
I think the first problem, the universal interpretation, and then the virtualization

542
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:04,550
of quantum data centers, both of these, I think, are going to occupy

543
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,666
my colleagues that are doing quantum computer science for many years to

544
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:12,078
come. Whereas the networking pieces of it where the

545
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:15,614
internal networking of a data center, quantum data center,

546
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:19,786
rather, or the external extension of a quantum

547
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:22,938
data center, will be occupying me for quite some time.

548
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:27,506
So I've gone through quantum computing and its application

549
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:31,458
to quantum communication. I've taken you through

550
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:35,218
a whole bunch of stuff. I've taken you through a journey through the impact of

551
00:34:35,224 --> 00:34:39,238
quantum computers onto current cryptography that

552
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,966
we use in networks today and the potential threat that there is. I've taken you

553
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:47,206
through how that same principles can be applied for quantum communication and

554
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:50,694
the benefits that could bring. I've indicated to you some of the problems that

555
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:54,246
we'll face on that particular journey, and also indicated to you

556
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:57,606
exactly how an idealized future may appear for us and

557
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,982
what the kind of problems are, if we're trying to address or aim to,

558
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:03,710
towards that idealized future. Anyway, I hope you've enjoyed the talk,

559
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,534
I hope you found it informative, and I look to hearing your questions.

560
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:08,606
Thanks very much.
