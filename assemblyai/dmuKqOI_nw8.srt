00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,434
Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Raj. I'm excited

2
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:46,642
to be here today to talk about the fascinating and transformative

3
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:50,586
field in the automotive industry, which is advances

4
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,630
driver assistance systems and autonomous driving.

5
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,454
Let's dive into it right away. In this

6
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:01,514
presentation, we'll delve into the exciting world of adas and autonomous

7
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,230
driving. Think of adas as your car's superpower,

8
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,410
which enhances safety and makes driving lot easier.

9
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,474
We'll explore the key components that power these

10
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:16,726
technologies, the impressive functions they perform,

11
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:21,026
and how we are steering towards fully autonomous vehicles.

12
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:24,754
Beyond this tech talk, it's all about making our roads

13
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:28,406
safer and transportation more efficient. So let's

14
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,754
navigate through the advancements that is shaping the future of

15
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,510
driving. I'll talk about the core components

16
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,206
and functions of adas, the computing needs of adas,

17
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:42,954
and finally touch upon the evolution towards the autonomous

18
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:46,990
vehicles and the impact on road safety and transportation.

19
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,560
So what is adas and ad?

20
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,494
ADAS stands for advanced driver assistance systems.

21
00:01:56,622 --> 00:02:00,222
It's a suite of technologies designed to enhance vehicle

22
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:04,638
safety and driving experience. From collision avoidance systems

23
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:08,002
to adaptive cruise control, ADAS represents a digital

24
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:12,146
copilot seamlessly integrating technology with driving.

25
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:16,274
And when it comes to autonomous driving, actually the vehicles they navigate

26
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:19,626
and operate without human input. This is

27
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:24,086
a shift from driver assist features to fully autonomous vehicles,

28
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:27,050
revolutionizing the concept of transportation.

29
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,930
Now, let's take a look at the brains and eyes behind

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,674
the magic of adas. Imagine your car being equipped

31
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:41,002
with superhero squad, each member playing a crucial

32
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:44,190
role. There are several members here, like radars,

33
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,406
cameras, ultrasonic sensors and lidars.

34
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:50,580
Let's see the functions of each of these members.

35
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,458
Consider a long range a radar. It scans the road ahead,

36
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:59,254
detect the objects from a distance, helping the car to

37
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:03,014
anticipate and react to potential dangers long before they become

38
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:06,438
an issue. And then short range radars. They have a

39
00:03:06,444 --> 00:03:10,454
keen sense of proximity. It focuses on the immediate surroundings,

40
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:13,850
ensuring your car navigates through tight spaces,

41
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,530
handles parking, and keeps an eye on blind spots.

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,890
And cameras. Interpret traffic signs.

43
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,034
Recognizes lane markings and provide a real time visual feed,

44
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:28,670
offering eCarx a comprehensive view of the environment.

45
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,918
And there are infrared cameras which act like stealthy night vision experts.

46
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:38,542
These cameras see what the human eye can't in low light conditions,

47
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:42,434
ensuring safety even during night when there is not

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,986
so much light. And there are ultrasonic

49
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,154
sensors like these are like silent guardians.

50
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:52,726
They are the ones responsible for detecting obstacles in

51
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:56,914
close quarters, making sure your car doesn't inadvertently

52
00:03:56,962 --> 00:04:00,730
bump into anything during low speed manures.

53
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,010
Last but not the least, lidar,

54
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,846
which is the precision mapper using laser beams,

55
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:11,002
Lidar creates a detailed 3d navigation of surroundings,

56
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:14,654
allowing the car to navigate complex environments and

57
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:17,310
understand the world with incredible accuracy.

58
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,706
Together, these components form the powerhouse of adas,

59
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:26,206
working seamlessly to make the driving experience safer and smarter.

60
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:30,542
It's like having a high tech team ensuring

61
00:04:30,606 --> 00:04:33,300
you're in good hands every time you hit the road.

62
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,522
Here are a few examples of advanced driver assistance systems.

63
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,870
There's some ADAS features, basically. So for example,

64
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,482
front collision warning. It alerts the driver if a potential

65
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:49,946
collision with the vehicle ahead is detected. And there

66
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,254
is automatic emergency braking which automatically

67
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:57,180
applies the brakes if the driver doesn't respond in time.

68
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,266
And for example, there is a lane departure

69
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:05,082
warning which notifies the driver if the vehicle unintentionally

70
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,794
drifts out of its lane. And there is lane keeping

71
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:11,934
assist which can gently steer the vehicle back into its

72
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:15,474
lane to prevent unintentional lane departure. So you see

73
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:18,770
a number of ADAS functions which are divided into

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,518
safety package, in comfort package and in parking package.

75
00:05:23,694 --> 00:05:27,622
So depending on which

76
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:31,154
kinds of features the car makers

77
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:34,582
choose, you will have those functions in

78
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:38,026
mid, premium or even entry kind

79
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:41,594
of vehicles. And maybe just to explain a couple

80
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,970
of functions more, there is for example

81
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,302
adaptive cruise control. This maintains the speed, but can automatically

82
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:52,960
adjust the speed based on the distance to the vehicles ahead.

83
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,146
It helps in maintaining a safe following distance in varying

84
00:05:57,178 --> 00:06:01,086
traffic conditions. And there is blind spot detection, which alerts the

85
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,654
driver if there's a vehicle in the blind spot.

86
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:08,530
Typically with a visual or audible warning. It enhances

87
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,060
and it gives an awareness during lane changes.

88
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,494
And then there are park assist technologies and

89
00:06:17,532 --> 00:06:21,238
automated parking assistant which basically

90
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:24,118
it steers the vehicle into a parking space,

91
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:27,598
providing guidance to the drivers. And there's

92
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,854
traffic sign recognition which uses cameras to identify

93
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:34,426
and interpret traffic signs displaying relevant information on the

94
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:38,086
dashboard. It helps drivers stay informed about speed

95
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:41,258
limits, stop signs and other road signs.

96
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,826
And there is something like cross traffic alert which warns

97
00:06:44,858 --> 00:06:48,110
the drivers of approaching traffic from sides,

98
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,006
especially when backing out of parking spaces. It advances safety

99
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,450
in situations where visibility may be limited.

100
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,638
These examples, they showcase the diversity of ADAs features,

101
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:04,510
contributing to safer and more convenient

102
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,150
driving experiences.

103
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,726
Coming to the compute power which is required for ADAs and

104
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:16,338
Ad, I would like to discuss this compute in three dimensions.

105
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:20,118
The first of it is cpu or the scalar computing.

106
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:23,930
The second one is gpu or for both

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,626
three d and parallel capability. And certainly the

108
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:31,326
most important for ADAs and Ad which is the

109
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:35,018
computing for machine learning and inferencing offload. So let's

110
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:38,494
have a look at cpu load first so

111
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:42,734
today we see socs that reach something beyond 100

112
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:46,114
kd mips. There are x 86 socs from

113
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:50,114
multiple vendors which they offer like

114
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:55,026
something about over 500 ktmips and beyond we

115
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:58,642
have server socs which can deliver as much as 5000

116
00:07:58,696 --> 00:08:02,338
ktmips. We can see quite a significant

117
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:05,606
dynamic range here. What's interesting is when

118
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:09,034
we start looking at ADAs and Ad, we see a higher level of

119
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,934
computational capacity for cpu, as much as 1000 kd

120
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:16,490
mips in the case of robotaxi class of applications.

121
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,494
On the gpu front, let's see what

122
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:24,234
options do we have silicon wise, we see arm igpus

123
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:27,886
which are the integrated gpus from half to about

124
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:31,658
five t flops. We see discrete gpus for pc,

125
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:35,438
mobile and desktop, ranging from 50 t flops

126
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:39,486
and then data center discrete gpus providing

127
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:43,170
even higher capability of t flops and other computational capacity.

128
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,826
So what does it look from an ADAS perspective? Even in ADAS

129
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:51,426
applications, we see a demand of gpu computing.

130
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:55,382
However, this isn't as much. Gpu requirements are ranging from

131
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:58,970
0.5 t flops, maybe something

132
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,378
like to one t flop. When we go to machine learning,

133
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:05,450
we see a pretty wide range of capabilities.

134
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,766
These are socs from five to 200 intake tops,

135
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:13,482
depending on the vendor in question. Data center is offering

136
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:17,566
like 500 intake tops and beyond. This is what is available in

137
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:20,746
the market today. Obviously, the market is responding rapidly

138
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:24,494
and aggressively to the increase in the capabilities for

139
00:09:24,532 --> 00:09:28,302
ADas and ad. We need as much as something

140
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:31,534
like 1000 intake t flops,

141
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:35,134
a very high level of dynamic range. We can also combine

142
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,646
two or more socs to get the required amount of tops depending on the

143
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:42,578
application. So with such high compute socs

144
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:46,566
at our disposal, and more and more autograde socs which

145
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:51,674
are available in the industry, we are able to address the

146
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:55,434
needs of all autonomous vehicles, especially from

147
00:09:55,472 --> 00:09:58,170
l three to l five autonomy vehicles.

148
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:02,126
Now let's see what kind

149
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:06,174
of chips are available with

150
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:09,690
some examples here I got some examples of chips

151
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:13,246
which we use for adas on autonomous driving.

152
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:17,058
So, cutting edge chipsets like this play a

153
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:20,610
pivotal role in meeting the computational demands,

154
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,420
which is essential for real time decision making and control.

155
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,430
As an example, horizon robotics.

156
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,174
They have an emphasis on edge computing. With them,

157
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:34,726
they excel in processing sensor data directly on

158
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:38,470
chip, particularly in computer vision and object recognition,

159
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,502
and then Nvidia or

160
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:45,802
in and Thor. Of course, the architecture stands out for its

161
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:49,382
powerful gpus, enabling high performance

162
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:53,354
parallel processing and simultaneous support for multiple

163
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,002
neural networks, which contributes to robust

164
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,954
perception capabilities in varied

165
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:04,862
driving scenarios. And then Texas instruments

166
00:11:05,006 --> 00:11:08,530
like TitDA four series. They focus

167
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,090
on sensor fusion,

168
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,986
efficiently integrating data from diverse sensors

169
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:19,446
to provide a comprehensive understanding of

170
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:22,854
the vehicle's environment and then

171
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:27,080
mobili. For example, they specialize in vision based

172
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,338
solutions with its iq chips, excelling in computer

173
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,934
vision algorithms for applications like lane departure,

174
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:38,742
warning and collision avoidance. So these chipsets,

175
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:42,874
they collectively address the intricate needs of adas and autonomous

176
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:46,240
driving. Their optimized designs support

177
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,034
tasks such as sensor fusion, real time perception,

178
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:55,198
and decision making, which is crucial for enhancing both safety

179
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,170
and autonomous capabilities.

180
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,318
Now let's have a look into the software elements.

181
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:05,274
They can be broadly classified into, like fusion,

182
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:09,174
perception, planning, middleware, and components for

183
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:12,870
safety. So what are these components? The fusion

184
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,866
software component. It acts like a brain of adults,

185
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:21,290
merging data from diverse sensors such as cameras,

186
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,982
radars, lidars, and create a comprehensive

187
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:28,010
and accurate representation of vehicle surroundings.

188
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,506
Perception software, on the other hand, involves advanced

189
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:35,214
algorithms that interpret sensor data,

190
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:38,590
recognizing objects, pedestrians, and road signs.

191
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,400
This components is crucial for real time decision making,

192
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,466
providing the system with the ability to identify and

193
00:12:46,488 --> 00:12:49,490
respond to dynamic changes in environment.

194
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,362
Middleware, with platforms like QNX and

195
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,314
Autosar, serves as the communication bridge between various hardware

196
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:00,406
and software components in the ADAS ecosystem. So,

197
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:04,214
QNX, it's a real

198
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:08,498
time operating system often used in automotive, which ensures

199
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:11,110
consistent and predictable performance.

200
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,974
And Autosar, it provides a standardized framework enabling

201
00:13:16,022 --> 00:13:19,626
seamless collaboration between the different software modules which

202
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:22,810
we have in the system. So also we need to ensure

203
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,938
that these ADAS software components, they adhere

204
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:30,366
to rigorous safety standards, and this is usually done by the

205
00:13:30,388 --> 00:13:34,286
NCAP certification, through the NCAP certification. So functional

206
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:38,002
safety, which encompasses standards like ISO 26262,

207
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:41,246
is paramount in the development of ADAS software,

208
00:13:41,438 --> 00:13:45,250
which emphasizing the implementation of measures

209
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,670
to prevent or control to control system

210
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,574
failures that could compromise safety. So these

211
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:57,362
elements collectively form the robust software backbone

212
00:13:57,426 --> 00:14:01,830
for adAs. Now, in the landscape of autonomous driving,

213
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,658
there are five levels of autonomy, from l zero to l five,

214
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,446
each representing a distinct step towards vehicles

215
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:13,374
that can navigate the roads without human intervention. So at level

216
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:16,766
zero, we have no automation where the driver is fully in

217
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:20,746
control. As we ascend through the levels, we witness the gradual

218
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:24,450
integration of automation, for example

219
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,740
from basic driver assistance features like some warning features at level one,

220
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,882
to driving features like adaptive cruise control in level

221
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:36,022
two, to conditional automation in level three,

222
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:40,066
where the vehicles can handle certain scenarios independently.

223
00:14:40,258 --> 00:14:43,554
So reaching level five, the pinnacle of autonomy.

224
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:46,694
We envision fully self driving vehicles that

225
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:50,554
can operate in any environment without human input. So this

226
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:54,662
evolution reflects not just a technological progress,

227
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:58,794
but also a paradigm shift in how we perceive and experience

228
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:03,086
transportation. So before I close.

229
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:06,462
Let's have a look at the impact of Adas and ad on road

230
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:10,558
safety and transportation. ADAs emerge as

231
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:14,718
vigilant copilots, significantly enhancing road safety

232
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:18,526
through features like collision avoidance systems, lane departure warnings,

233
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:21,934
and adaptive cruise control. Simultaneously,

234
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:25,570
autonomous driving has a revolutionary impact on safety,

235
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,798
where vehicles are capable of swift, split second decision making,

236
00:15:29,964 --> 00:15:33,138
reducing accidents, and enhancing traffic flow.

237
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:37,358
It also enhances accessibility and inclusivity in transportation,

238
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:40,954
opening new avenues for individuals with

239
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:44,220
disabilities and accommodating diverse needs.

240
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,646
The integration of these technologies brings

241
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:52,474
many environmental benefits to optimizing traffic

242
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:55,642
patterns and reducing fuel consumption

243
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,262
and emissions, thereby contributing to a greener and more

244
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:02,734
sustainable transportation ecosystem. So,

245
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:06,654
in conclusion, the combined influence of ADAs and AD

246
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:10,590
marks a revolutionary shift in the future of transportation,

247
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,574
from advanced safety features to

248
00:16:15,612 --> 00:16:18,962
redefining accessibility and promoting environmental

249
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:22,614
sustainability. I hope the

250
00:16:22,652 --> 00:16:25,954
talk was end of the presentation.

251
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:29,350
I hope this short talk about ADAs and ad has sparked interest

252
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,786
in some of you and helps you to further deep

253
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:36,006
dive on some of these topics. Thank you.

254
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:37,270
Have a nice day.
