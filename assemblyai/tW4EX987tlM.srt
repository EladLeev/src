00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,318
Hi, I welcome you all to

2
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:28,306
topic week of unleashing the power of quantum computing from theory

3
00:00:28,338 --> 00:00:31,666
to practical application. My name is Emmanuel Samir Harris,

4
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,178
and it's a pleasure to present my presentation

5
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:38,946
before you for this conference,

6
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:44,390
that is conference 42, Quantum Computing 2023.

7
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,440
So let's get started.

8
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:51,114
Unleashing the power of quantum computing from theory to practical

9
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:54,446
application quantum computing has the potential to

10
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:58,094
revolutionarize the world of computations. In this

11
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:01,626
presentation, we'll explore the basic of quantum computing,

12
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:05,726
its practical application, and future development. Quantum computing basic

13
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:09,106
okay, let's start with the basic. As everything has a

14
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:12,414
basic, so even quantum computing has basics.

15
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:16,086
Quantum bits, qubits that what we call

16
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:20,406
quantum bits or qubits, is a fundamental unit of quantum information.

17
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:24,294
Unlike classical bits, which can only have two

18
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:28,006
states, zero or one, qubits can exist in a superposition

19
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:31,606
of both state at once. This gives quantum computations

20
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:35,222
the potential to perform certain calculations much faster

21
00:01:35,286 --> 00:01:38,362
than classical computers since they can

22
00:01:38,416 --> 00:01:41,962
process many possible inputs simultaneously. Qubits can be

23
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:45,162
implemented in various physical system such as ions,

24
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:48,826
superconducting circuits, or even individual photons.

25
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:52,410
However, qubits are subject to various sources of noise

26
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,254
and error, which can make it difficult to maintain

27
00:01:56,302 --> 00:01:59,682
their delicate quantum states as a

28
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:03,006
long period of time. As a result, much of quantum

29
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:06,566
computing research is focused on developing error correction techniques and

30
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:09,922
improvement the quality of qubits. Unlike classical bits,

31
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:14,022
qubits can exit in superposition of states,

32
00:02:14,156 --> 00:02:17,890
allowing for multiple calculation to take place simultaneously.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,974
Let's come to the second thing. These second thing is of quantum mechanics.

34
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:25,526
Quantum computing makes use of principle quantum mechanics,

35
00:02:25,638 --> 00:02:29,206
including entanglement and tunneling. Quantum mechanics

36
00:02:29,238 --> 00:02:33,166
is these branch of physics that studies the behavior of

37
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:37,354
matter and energy at the smallest scale, such as atoms and subatom

38
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:40,634
particles. It includes concepts such as wave particle

39
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:45,102
duality, superposition, and entanglement,

40
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,430
which are fundamental to our understanding of quantum computing.

41
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,906
While quantum computing is still in

42
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:55,714
its early stage of development, researchers believe that it has the potential

43
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:58,802
to revolutionarize fields such as cryptography,

44
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:03,014
material science, and drug discovery. As the technology

45
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:06,438
continues to improve, we may see more and more application

46
00:03:06,524 --> 00:03:10,618
of quantum computing in coming years. The third

47
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:14,214
a brief history from the first quantum algorithm

48
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:18,106
proposed by Richard Feynman in 1982 to

49
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:22,382
the development of the first quantum computers in the 1990s,

50
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:25,822
the field of quantum computing has made great stride in recent years.

51
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:28,906
Let's continue more below. A brief

52
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:32,754
history of the quantum computing quantum computing has been an

53
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:36,226
activity area of research since the 1980s,

54
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:39,794
when the physicist Richard Heyman first proposed the idea of

55
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:43,374
using quantum systems to stimulate quantum

56
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:47,774
phenomena more efficiently than classical

57
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:51,986
computers. In 1994, Peter Shaw develops a quantum algorithm

58
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:56,082
that could factor large number of exponential faster

59
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:59,946
than any known classic algorithm, demonstrating the potential of

60
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:04,150
quantum computers to solve problems that are intracellible for classical

61
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,430
computers. In the year followed, shore algorithm

62
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,026
researcher develop a number of other quantum algorithms

63
00:04:11,078 --> 00:04:15,498
such as a Grover's search algorithm and the quantum simulation

64
00:04:15,594 --> 00:04:19,066
algorithm. The first experimental demonstration of quantum computing

65
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:22,634
were also carried out in the 1990s using system such

66
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,038
as nuclear magnetic resonance,

67
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:28,194
NMR and iron traps. Since then,

68
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:32,226
the field of quantum computing has continued to grow rapidly with

69
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:36,514
the development of new hardware architectures, programming languages and

70
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:40,386
quantum algorithms. Notably, milestones include the creation

71
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:43,666
of the first five qubit and 16 qubit quantum computers

72
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:47,658
by IBM in 2016 and 2017, respectively, and the

73
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:51,350
development of fault tolerant quantum error correction codes

74
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,190
by several research groups. Despite the progress

75
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,858
in quantum computing, many challenges remain. One of the

76
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:02,826
biggest challenges in the development of large scale, fault tolerant quantum

77
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:06,634
computers, which will require significant improvement

78
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,522
in qubit quality and error correction technique.

79
00:05:10,586 --> 00:05:13,906
Nevertheless, researchers remain optimistic about the potential of

80
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:17,486
quantum computing to revolutionize fields such as cryptography,

81
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,100
material science, drug discovery in the coming years.

82
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,826
Popular quantum algorithm shows algorithm we

83
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:27,750
have Grover's algorithm and quantum machine learning.

84
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,318
Let's go through them one by one. Shows algorithm shows algorithm is

85
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:35,026
a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. It allows

86
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:38,506
for efficient factorization of large number which has

87
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:42,934
important applications for cryptography. Many encryption

88
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:47,334
schemes rely on the fact that factoring large number of computations

89
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,606
difficult for classical computers. However,

90
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:53,886
Shore's algorithm shows that this problem can be

91
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:57,194
solved quickly on a quantum computer, which would render

92
00:05:57,242 --> 00:06:00,510
many current encryption method insecure.

93
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,386
Grover's algorithm Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for

94
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:08,354
searching an unsorted database. It can speed up search problems by

95
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:12,222
an exponential factor, making it a powerful tool for optimization.

96
00:06:12,366 --> 00:06:15,810
For example, if you had a database of nth items

97
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,478
and you want to find a particular item, a classical computer

98
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:23,254
would need to search through all n items one by

99
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,486
one, taking O n and a time.

100
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:30,214
Grover's algorithm, on the other hand, can solve the problem in o

101
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:33,782
square at n time, which is significant

102
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:37,242
speed up for large databases. Quantum machine learning

103
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,586
quantum machine learning is an emerging field that combines quantum computing

104
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:44,078
with artificial intelligence. As you can see that

105
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:47,774
the future of artificial intelligence is combining it with the

106
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:51,210
quantum machine learning. It has the potential

107
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,722
to enhance AI by processing data much faster than

108
00:06:54,776 --> 00:06:58,494
classical computers. Some of the application of quantum machine

109
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:02,286
learning includes image and speech recognition, drug discovery,

110
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:06,102
and material science. However, quantum machine learning is still

111
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:09,766
in its early stage of development and much research is

112
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:13,618
focused on developing new algorithms architecture for quantum computers

113
00:07:13,714 --> 00:07:17,202
cryptography secure communication crypto analysis

114
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:20,890
secure communication quantum computing could

115
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,662
be used to develop an unbreakable system for securing

116
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:28,380
communication between two parties. Crypto analysis what is that?

117
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,746
It is quantum computers could also be used for breaking

118
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:36,560
current cryptographic system with ease, posing a major

119
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,878
threat to security. Okay, in which

120
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,450
area again we can actually use quantum computing. It is the

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,574
drug discovery quantum stimulation quantum computing

122
00:07:48,622 --> 00:07:52,174
could all allow for more accurate simulation of molecular

123
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:56,086
interaction, speeding up drug discovery and reducing these cost of

124
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,840
clinical trial optimization problems.

125
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,362
Efficiently optimizing drug candidates and designing

126
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:07,494
custom molecules to interact with the specific biological target would

127
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:10,438
have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industries.

128
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:14,118
What are the challenges? Developing precise model for molecules and handling

129
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:17,914
the complexity of simulating large biological system

130
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:21,150
are some of the challenges that researchers are currently facing.

131
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,960
Optimization problem how can we actually help with that?

132
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,986
Route optimization quantum computing could help optimizing

133
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:32,506
delivery route, reducing transportation costs and

134
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:36,110
improving efficiency. Quantum nel a quantum

135
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,870
optimization approach that could help solve complex optimization

136
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,534
problems across diverse industries from finance

137
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:47,542
to logistics. Fluid dynamics quantum computing could allow for

138
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:51,314
more accurate modeling of fluid dynamics and application in aerospace,

139
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:55,350
energy production, and more manufacturing and robotics.

140
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,846
How quantum computing can help us in this field supply

141
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:03,558
chain optimization quantum computing could optimize these supply chain

142
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:06,598
management, reducing cost and improving efficiency.

143
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:10,762
Robotic control system quantum computing could provide more efficient

144
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:14,350
control system for robotic, improving their capabilities across

145
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,934
industries from manufacturing to healthcare. Challenges the high

146
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:21,646
cost and complexity of quantum computing hardware are some of

147
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:25,490
the challenges facing its adaptation in these industries.

148
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,462
What is the future of quantum computing? Hardware advancement new hardware,

149
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:34,174
architectural and material such as topological

150
00:09:34,222 --> 00:09:37,682
qubits could help overcome some of the current challenges in quantum computing.

151
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:40,934
Software. Challenges new software tools and algorithms are needed to make

152
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:44,866
quantum computing more accessible and solve real world problem impact

153
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:48,026
on various industries from finance and healthcare to material science and

154
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:51,466
cryptography, quantum computing has the potential to

155
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,554
transform many aspect of our lives.

156
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:57,462
Let's move on to quantum computing hardware and software.

157
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:00,810
Okay, presenting the current state of quantum hardware

158
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,266
including various technologies, superconducting iron traps, et cetera

159
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:08,314
and their challenges. The slide focus on the existing quantum computing

160
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:12,486
hardware technology. It highlights key technology like superconducting qubits

161
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:16,162
and iron trap qubits. We can

162
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,746
actually try to see the superconducting qubits are

163
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:23,314
based on superconducting circuits and have been

164
00:10:23,352 --> 00:10:27,414
a popular choice due to their scalability, but they face challenges related to the

165
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:30,914
maintaining qubit stability and reducing noise. Iron traps qubits,

166
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:34,326
on the other hand, use trap ions to represent qubits and have

167
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:39,020
the advantage of longer coerced timing mention.

168
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,674
The other technologies that we can actually see are

169
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:47,514
such as the Topo logical qubits and photon based

170
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:51,658
quantum computing are also being explored. Let's explore

171
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:54,990
the quantum software development framework and programming language.

172
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:59,306
The example will be cusket and cirque. This slide

173
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:02,154
focuses on the software aspect of quantum computing.

174
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:06,290
Software plays a crucial role in designing and implementing quantum algorithm,

175
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,740
simulating quantum system and

176
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,290
optimizing quantum computations. Quantum software development

177
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,254

interface resource and a supportive community to facilitate the development and advancement

204
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:01,974
of quantum software, highlighting the need for

205
00:13:02,012 --> 00:13:05,000
error correction and quantum error correction code.

206
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,134
Let's move and discuss about this part. Quantum computing qubits

207
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:13,926
are highly sensitive to noise and external disturbances, which can lead to error

208
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:18,278
and degrade the performance of quantum computations.

209
00:13:18,454 --> 00:13:22,010
These errors can arise from factors such as environmental

210
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,122
interaction, imperfection in hardware computers, and inherent

211
00:13:26,186 --> 00:13:29,386
fragility of quantum state. As quantum

212
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:33,454
computers become large and more complex, the occurrence

213
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:36,398
of error becomes increasingly likely,

214
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:40,078
hindering the reliable execution of quantum algorithm.

215
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:43,538
To overcome these challenges, error correction techniques and

216
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:47,602
quantum error correction code has been developed. Error Correction

217
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,994
is a critical aspect of quantum computing as it allows

218
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:54,962
for the detection and mitigation of errors, thereby preserving

219
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:58,854
the integrity of quantum information and enabling reliable

220
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:02,860
quantum computation. Quantum error correction code are

221
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,326
specialized coding schemes that are designed to detect and correct errors

222
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:12,302
in quantum states. These cases provide redundancy by

223
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:16,346
encoding quantum information in such a way that error can be detected

224
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:20,526
and corrected without directly measuring the fragile quantum state.

225
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,822
The most well known quantum error correction code

226
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:27,506
is the surface code which is cases on a two dimensional grid of

227
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:30,750
qubits. By applying a set of carefully designed operations,

228
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,098
the surface code can detect errors that occur during

229
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:38,178
quantum computation and enable their correction. Other cases

230
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:42,342
such as the color code and topological codes are also

231
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:45,378
being explored for their error correcting capabilities.

232
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:49,654
Quantum error correction codes are essential for achieving fault

233
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,574
tolerant quantum computation where errors can be effectively

234
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:57,622
managed and suppressed by encoding quantum information redundantly

235
00:14:57,686 --> 00:15:01,674
and use error correction code. Quantum computers

236
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:05,614
can operate reliably even in the presence of noise and

237
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:09,226
errors, highlighting the needs for error correction

238
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:12,506
and quantum error correction code underscores the

239
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:16,802
significance of developing robust techniques to

240
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:20,926
handle error in quantum computing. System error correction

241
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:25,402
course provides a pathway towards scalable and fault oriented quantum computers

242
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:29,266
and ensure the accuracy and fidelity of quantum computations.

243
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,714
Researchers and scientists are actively exploring various error

244
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:37,786
correction strategies and code to improve the stability and

245
00:15:37,808 --> 00:15:41,574
reliability of quantum computation. By incorporating error correction technique,

246
00:15:41,622 --> 00:15:45,382
the potential of quantum computing can be fully realized,

247
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:49,130
enabling complex computations with higher

248
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,426
accuracy and precisions. Let's move on to these quantum

249
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:56,154
algorithm and its application. In these section, let's delve

250
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:59,786
into the fascination world of quantum algorithm

251
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:02,670
and explore these practical applications.

252
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,134
Quantum algorithm harnesses the unique properties

253
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:10,302
of quantum system to solve certain problems more efficiently

254
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:14,466
than classical algorithm. Introducing key

255
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:18,374
quantum algorithms and their

256
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:22,002
advantages over classical algorithm first, let's discuss some key quantum

257
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:25,506
algorithm that has revolutionarized the field of computations.

258
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:29,226
One remarkable example is Shaw's algorithm. It is a

259
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:32,522
quantum algorithm that efficiently factors large

260
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:36,614
number of tasks that would take classical

261
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,318
computers an impractically long time shows algorithm cases a

262
00:16:40,324 --> 00:16:43,982
potential threat to classical cryptography system as it

263
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:47,674
can quickly break the widely used RSA encryption schema.

264
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:51,226
Another notable algorithm is Grover's algorithm. It provides

265
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:55,234
a quadratic speed up in

266
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:58,574
searching an unsorted database compared to classical

267
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:02,130
algorithm. This has significant applications for data

268
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,194
retrieval and optimizational problem where

269
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,162
finding the best solution from a large search space is essential.

270
00:17:10,306 --> 00:17:13,910
Let's come to the second part that is showcasing the practical application

271
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,446
of the quantum computing. Let's try to understand this as well.

272
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:21,334
Quantum computing is not just a theoretical concept, it has promising

273
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:24,714
real world applications as this whole theme of me

274
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:28,214
presenting is all about that. One such application is cryptography,

275
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:32,326
which with the advent of quantum computers,

276
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:35,806
new cryptography algorithm resistant to quantum attacks are

277
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:39,354
being developed. These algorithms leverage the unique

278
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:43,294
properties of quantum systems such as quantum key distribution and quantum resistant

279
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:47,042
encryption. Scheme optimization problems are another

280
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:51,474
domain where quantum computing excellence many

281
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:55,246
real world problems such as resource allocation, supply chain

282
00:17:55,278 --> 00:17:59,410
optimization and portfolio optimization involves exploring

283
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,394
vast search space. Quantum algorithm can provide exponential speed

284
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:07,294
ups, enabling us to find optimum solution more efficiently.

285
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:10,650
Machine learning is an area where quantum computing hold

286
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,982
immense potential. Quantum machine unleashing algorithm

287
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:19,530
has the potential to enhance pattern recognition, clustering and optimization

288
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,330
task. Quantum inspiration technique like quantum inspiration,

289
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,410
neural network has shown promising result in solving complex

290
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,254
optimizational problems. Let's come to the third part that

291
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:36,526
is providing real world example and success stories to illustrate the practical impact

292
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,146
of quantum computing. Let us share some real world example in the field

293
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:43,874
of quantum chemistry. Quantum computers are

294
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:47,254
revolutionarizing the simulation of molecular system.

295
00:18:47,372 --> 00:18:50,866
This has profound applications for drug

296
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:54,018
discovery, material design and understanding chemical reaction

297
00:18:54,194 --> 00:18:57,814
at an unprecedented level of detail. The financial

298
00:18:57,862 --> 00:19:01,546
industry is also exploring quantum computing to tackle complex problems.

299
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,886
Quantum algorithms can be utilized in financial modeling,

300
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:08,634
risk analysis and portfolio optimization, enabling more

301
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:12,106
accurate predictions and efficient resource allocation.

302
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:15,530
Several success stories has emerged from industries embracing

303
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,358
quantum computing. For instance, a leading airline company uses quantum computing to

304
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:23,194
optimize flight routes and reduce fuel consumption,

305
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:26,766
resulting in significant cost saving and reducing carbon emission

306
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,670
in health care. Quantum computing is being explored for personalized

307
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,334
medicine, genomics and optimizing

308
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:38,226
treatment plan, potentially leading to breakthrough

309
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:40,790
in disease diagnosis and treatment.

310
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,134
By showcasing these application and success stories, we can understand the

311
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,734
transformative potential of quantum computing in its various domains

312
00:19:49,782 --> 00:19:54,730
and its ability to solve problems that were previously intractable.

313
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,610
Let's come to the next slide.

314
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,110
That is visualizing a quantum circuit.

315
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,086
So I have actually done that on

316
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:10,750
the Jupiter Ide where I actually

317
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,450
imported the quizkit. And as you can see, then I started

318
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,414
drawing a quantum circuit. When building a quantum circuit,

319
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:21,806
it is often helpful to draw the circuit. This is supportively,

320
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:25,060
natively by a quantum circuit object.

321
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,558
We can either call print on the circuit or call the draw method on the

322
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:33,746
object. This will render an ASCII art version

323
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:36,982
of the circuit diagram. Let's building a

324
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,266
quantum circuit now. Okay. Circuit as

325
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,674
you can see, this is what I have given.

326
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:48,326
Circuit is equal to quantum circuit three comma

327
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:52,122
three. And then the command. What I have given is circuit x

328
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:56,030
one circuit h range. We have taken as three and circuit

329
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,426
cx as zero and one circuit measurement as range of three to range

330
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:04,530
of three. Then we have printed the circuit and this is the circuit

331
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,578
diagram. Okay. And also we

332
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:11,922
have given the circuit run. I've sourced this

333
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:15,606
from the Quizkit visualization of

334
00:21:15,628 --> 00:21:19,046
quantum circuit unleashing the

335
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:23,030
power of quantum computing. Let's now turn our attention to the challenges that

336
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,966
quantum computing faces and explores the exciting future prospect of

337
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:30,730
this transformative field. I have given these points

338
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,806
here discussing the current challenges in scaling up quantum computers

339
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:39,034
and improving qubit stability. One of the primary challenges we

340
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:42,622
face in quantum computing is scaling up the number of qubits and the building

341
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,346
large quantum computers. Currently, we are working with a relatively

342
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:51,370
small scale system due to technical constraints and delicate

343
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,942
nature of qubits. Developing robust and scalable hardware

344
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:58,734
architecture is crucial to realize the full potential of quantum

345
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:02,274
computing. Another challenge we encounter is

346
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:06,158
improving qubit stability and reducing noise. Qubits are extremely

347
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:09,970
sensitive to environmental disturbances, leading to error and

348
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,506
decohers. Advancement in material science

349
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:17,758
and engineering are needed to enhance qubit coherence

350
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:21,446
times and reduce error rate, paving the way for more reliable

351
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:24,890
quantum computations, touching upon the need for

352
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,898
continued research and collaboration in the field.

353
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:31,726
