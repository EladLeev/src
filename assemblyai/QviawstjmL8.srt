00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:21,186
welcome to avoiding Goodheart's law using slos as tools,

7
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:25,010
not cuddles before I start sharing the PowerPoint,

8
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,914
let me just cover what we're going to talk about. See the concepts of SLI

9
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:32,598
and SLO and error budget. They're there to balance risk and reward

10
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:36,170
risk around the acceptable rate of change and reward being the business

11
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,926
success and customer contentment. Using such metrics to punish

12
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,630
teams for exceeding budgets or forcing acceptance of change

13
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,118
within the business is a path to failure. And this session is

14
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:51,226
going to give you some hints for success. But first, maybe I should introduce

15
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:55,258
myself. I'm Marco Coulter. I am an ex CTO who

16
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:58,882
has worked for one of the top 50 international banks. I've supported data

17
00:01:58,936 --> 00:02:02,466
centers for hospitals and service providers. I've worked for

18
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:05,966
some of the industry's largest vendors. I've lived in three countries

19
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:08,390
and managed teams across 13 countries.

20
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,550
I also spent five years as an industry analyst.

21
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,470
I ran the data science team organization at four five one research,

22
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,030
which has since been acquired by standards and tools.

23
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,734
Seeing technology from every side as an operator, a developer can analyst,

24
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:26,874
a vendor, a buyer, and a CTO gives me a unique view

25
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:30,446
on technology. I can read or, sorry, you can

26
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:33,918
read some of my writing or interviews in the publications on the

27
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:38,414
left here or on my website, tech whisperer.com.

28
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:42,494
So enough about me. It's good

29
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:46,398
to have targets, right? Think of Robin Hood. The story where

30
00:02:46,484 --> 00:02:49,826
he places a child against a tree and he loads up an arrow and he

31
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:53,326
aims now with an apple was the target on the child's

32
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:57,202
head. This is the story of a skilled archer, but without

33
00:02:57,256 --> 00:03:01,110
a target. Without the target, Apple. It's the story of a crazy

34
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,958
guy, dangerous guy, shooting arrows at children.

35
00:03:04,124 --> 00:03:07,570
So it's good to have targets as long as you use them correctly.

36
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,590
And that's what we're going to talk about. Today's session comes in three chapters.

37
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,226
I will talk about how I experiences Goodhart's law

38
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:19,114
before I even knew it existed. Then we will think

39
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:22,682
about slis in a better way, across dimensions.

40
00:03:22,826 --> 00:03:26,602
And then finally, I'm going to throw a few hints about negotiations, your Slis,

41
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:30,654
and give you some links to further reading. So let's get

42
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:33,934
going. I'll get to good heart's law in a moment, but first

43
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:38,094
I want to share a story of my experience with you, depending on your personality,

44
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:41,362
you will either relax and enjoy my story, or you might already

45
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:44,958
be searching for good heart on Wikipedia. That sort of thing of searching

46
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,454
for the answer first is that's gaming the system. And some

47
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:51,062
folks see gaming the system as the smart play.

48
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:53,890
Others equate the phrase to like cheating.

49
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,294
I'm more in the second group. For me, gaming the system means manipulating

50
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:02,806
the rules meant to protect a system, to instead manipulate

51
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:05,530
the system towards a desired outcome.

52
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,654
In a prior life back in Australia, I worked for

53
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:14,286
a service provider that supported all of the hospitals in a

54
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:17,694
state. In hospitals, nurses, they take

55
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:20,830
lab samples and they get sent to the labs.

56
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,090
They are processed and the results get

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,658
transmitted back to the patient record where the nurses back in

58
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:30,900
the ward can then immediately look them up.

59
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,138
Pretty simple, right? By the way, the wards are up on

60
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:38,278
the 16th floor or somewhere high up in the hospital buildings, while the

61
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:41,826
labs are generally in the basement of another building on the campus. So there's

62
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:44,440
some physical distance between the two.

63
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,620
Technically, it looked a little like this.

64
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,930
The messages from the lab's Unix system would be sent

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,882
into message queues and the queues would be read by the lab.

66
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:04,026
Update would feed the lab updates into the mainframe system holding

67
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:07,742
the patient records. Now, everything allegedly spoke a

68
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:11,360
common HL seven standard slo. There was never going to be any problems,

69
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,380
all different vendors involved. I think you see where this is going.

70
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:19,314
The support of the HL seven standard was not perfect.

71
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:23,314
Malformed messages created by proprietary software along

72
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:25,570
the way would get stuck in the queue.

73
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,854
We would then get phone calls from hospitals that they

74
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:34,434
had to go to manual procedures. Now, the backup procedure,

75
00:05:34,562 --> 00:05:38,166
if the patient record is not getting updated, was for the nurse to

76
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,738
physically run down from the ward to the labs to get the

77
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:45,622
results and bring it back to the ward. That was not optimal

78
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:49,194
as the patient's health was at risk both from the delay and

79
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:52,922
from the nurse being absent. To take care of this,

80
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:56,814
we agreed an SLA that if the message queues got higher

81
00:05:56,852 --> 00:06:00,746
than 100, the service provider that I worked for had to refund

82
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,040
money back. And that should address things, right?

83
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,126
Looking at the thing that we thought was broken. So I coded a bash monitor

84
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:11,106
script, and so when the queue length approached, 100 alerts would go off.

85
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:15,390
Monocor icons would turn from green to yellow to red. As technicians,

86
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,410
we were focusing on the measure as the target, the goal.

87
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,306
We even built capacity plans around making sure the queue processing

88
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,734
got all the power it needed. Now you might think, well, that's great,

89
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:31,482
Marco. Top notch result lab results. Get back to the ward in time,

90
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:35,306
right? The only problem was that

91
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:39,354
we would get these pesky phone calls from nurses in the wards saying

92
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:42,782
the system sucked. They were always having to

93
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:46,880
run down and manually collect results. But the

94
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,702
message queues were empty. So the problem was that

95
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:54,990
transactions were often timing out before hitting the message queue.

96
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,182
We hadn't seen the whole picture. We were managing the capacity

97
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:03,262
plan, in fact, the whole application to the metric,

98
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:06,470
not to the outcome. Now, years later,

99
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,326
I learned that this behavior had a name. Yes, finally, we're going to get to

100
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:14,114
Goodhart. Goodhart was an economist

101
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:18,002
in the U. K. And in 1975 he stated,

102
00:07:18,066 --> 00:07:21,494
I'm just going to read this. Any observed statistical

103
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:25,002
regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it

104
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:28,794
for control purposes. It's kind of wordy, I guess. He was

105
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:32,142
english and a politician, and wordy is what you get.

106
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:36,414
Anyway, here is what he meant. Basically, Goodhart's law

107
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:39,918
says that when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a

108
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:43,982
good measure. You see, Q length was a good measure

109
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,426
of q function. We were managing to that as a

110
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:50,782
target for success, building capacity

111
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:54,414
plans and so on, based on the queue instead of the successful

112
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:57,350
laboratory transactions in patients'records.

113
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,566
So how do we avoid Goodhart's law?

114
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:04,774
Well, we needed to let the slis be measures and

115
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:07,510
then use the slos as the goal.

116
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,570
So what should we measure?

117
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,782
And the key is to stand in other people's shoes,

118
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:19,722
see everything from a few different angles. Hence three

119
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:23,294
dimensions. Remember that SRE is really

120
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:27,134
about balancing the risk of unavailability against

121
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:31,086
rapid innovation and efficient operation. And we embrace that

122
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:35,038
risk by giving it a value through well defined and governed

123
00:08:35,134 --> 00:08:37,890
service level indicators, objectives and agreements.

124
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,330
As you are identifying slis,

125
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,794
we need measures that see the whole picture in the three

126
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:49,350
key dimensions. So let's step through a simple example of

127
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,106
each of these dimensions based on that hostile environment. The examples

128
00:08:53,138 --> 00:08:56,786
will not give specific slis that you can apply to your environment.

129
00:08:56,818 --> 00:09:00,700
It's not meant to. The example is intended to share the thought process.

130
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,590
So first, let's quickly review the SLI SLO

131
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,226
slas model so that we're talking about the same thing.

132
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:12,766
So SLI, or service level indicators, are the numbers

133
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:17,178
and work better when they are percentiles. Avoid averages,

134
00:09:17,354 --> 00:09:21,178
you miss things. In mature environments. Slis will be nested.

135
00:09:21,274 --> 00:09:24,770
They will combine from slis that sit against the code

136
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,274
and the technology, up to slis that sit next to the customer.

137
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:32,130
They are a defined quantitative measure, a metric

138
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,882
you will then set limits on the slis, say an upper band

139
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:40,118
or maybe upper and lower, and that gives us the

140
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,470
SLO service level objective.

141
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,358
Slos should capture the performance and availability levels that,

142
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:49,978
if barely met, would keep your typical customer

143
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:54,470
happy. They are generally target failures

144
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,706
are less than x or a range. Responses will

145
00:09:57,728 --> 00:10:01,702
be between x and y. Generally, I like to translate the slos

146
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:04,998
into periodic budgets of between x and y over

147
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:08,714
this period of time that I can track weekly, but that weekly timing

148
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:11,886
might depend on your release cycles and so on. Maybe you can expend it a

149
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:15,470
month, maybe you need it every single day. The slas

150
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,722
define what actions are acceptable once the budget gets used

151
00:10:18,776 --> 00:10:22,210
up. Defining these ahead of time is critical.

152
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,938
There's one additional thing. Full outages tend to

153
00:10:25,944 --> 00:10:29,826
happen less these days, so the focus needs to be on sort of slowdowns

154
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:32,994
as well. So rather than traditional uptime

155
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,726
availability, I try to focus on the customer domain and their experience,

156
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:41,530
and then use successful customer requests as a general

157
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,302
goal instead. Now, to capture the overall environment,

158
00:10:45,366 --> 00:10:48,698
those nested slis supporting the customer experience,

159
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:52,750
supporting the CX ones, should cover each of the three dimensions.

160
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,622
So first, let's start with the code. Now, from our code,

161
00:10:56,676 --> 00:11:00,682
we want functional code that does not fail, and additional

162
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:04,198
measures and write downs of technical depth.

163
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:08,302
Slo, you'll be dealing along the way with multiple languages.

164
00:11:08,366 --> 00:11:12,530
So you want to make sure that the metrics will work across them generically,

165
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,246
where you can avoid metrics that would only apply to a specific coding

166
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,646
language. It's too much extra handling. You're creating work for yourself.

167
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:24,626
I guess you're creating tech debt in a sense, even in the measure.

168
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:28,262
Also, it will not be limited to applications you built in house.

169
00:11:28,316 --> 00:11:31,786
So sometimes you're going to have to deal with third party applications like SAP and

170
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:35,414
the ABAP language, or SLAs applications like Salesforce.

171
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:39,354
And maybe what you're managing is environmental like know

172
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:42,622
or your reaction times in pagerduty or something.

173
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:46,506
And then you're not just watching the code transaction errors,

174
00:11:46,618 --> 00:11:49,854
you are looking at the configurations and looking for

175
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:53,806
configurations errors again. So some of these nested

176
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:58,446
slis there around the code might indicate yaml

177
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:02,798
code accuracy or something like that. If you're running a Kubernetes environment,

178
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:06,350
you want to avoiding silos of data. Here you don't want the SRE

179
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:10,214
team working off one source of metrics while the development team works off another.

180
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:14,018
You need a single source of SLI truth as part of deciding

181
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,200
what you will base the slos on.

182
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,890
So for the sample indicator in

183
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,570
healthcare, let's embed a few clarifications. Our first step

184
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,582
would be to focus on well formed updates. That specifies

185
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:32,238
the transaction that we're looking at. We want to update the patient record

186
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,830
and acknowledge completion successfully.

187
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:39,246
That acknowledge of completion specifies the reaction. And in

188
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:42,254
this case, we agreed to using an APM tool,

189
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:46,094
an application performance monitoring as the tool, and that specifies

190
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:50,034
the source of the data, that single

191
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:53,886
place of truth. Now I'm familiar with appdynamics for ABM,

192
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:57,286
but you could be just as easily use Datadog or

193
00:12:57,308 --> 00:13:00,854
new relic. In fact, as we are only concerned about code here,

194
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:04,360
you might prefer observability offerings like honeycomb or

195
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,226
know this observability segment. I don't know. IBM acquired Astala

196
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:13,866
observability is getting very interesting right now. Now, some SLI

197
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:18,166
books recommend good over bad ratios for slis.

198
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:22,106
If you control all the code, that can work. But in

199
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:25,486
this example, I'm avoiding the fail ratio as there were too

200
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:28,986
many elements out of our control. The HL seven update transactions

201
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:33,194
were coming out of purchase proprietary software running on the lab hardware.

202
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:37,058
We had no way of fixing that code. We had to wait for patches to

203
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:40,194
come in, so we were not going to be held accountable for

204
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:44,110
those failures. Also, the queuing systems were third party software, different vendor

205
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,518
SLO. We couldn't tweak them to respond better, to malformed entries, to not

206
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:52,086
get stuck, and we could not be certain that

207
00:13:52,108 --> 00:13:55,190
we would reach a point where the HL seven outputs were always

208
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,458
well formed, so that the basic code SLI would

209
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:03,002
need to be focused on well formed updates, getting to the code

210
00:14:03,056 --> 00:14:06,746
that we were writing and controlling. So that's an SLI down the

211
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:09,770
bottom of the nesting in meetings,

212
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,750
but just an example. So for the code SLO,

213
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,346
we are already assuming well formed HL

214
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:23,450
seven records so we can set this fairly high.

215
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,006
Again, we're being clear about the transaction, the reaction,

216
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:30,226
and the source. And it's often easy to

217
00:14:30,248 --> 00:14:34,100
set this goal tools high. Remember, the goal is people say

218
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,846
they like to say 100% for slos, but that means there

219
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:41,910
will be no experimentation, no innovation, no risk taking.

220
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,734
So it needs to be just over the level that will keep customers happy.

221
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,366
Too high. And opportunity costs, opportunity costs

222
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:52,762
are being wasted. Okay, so for the code

223
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:56,266
SLA, we need

224
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:59,690
to apply an outcome now. Note the SLA goal also

225
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,594
allows some wiggle room with the SLO. We added a time range

226
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:07,306
here now, and the SLO must be met over a sliding range

227
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:10,858
of 28 days. The SLA should specify

228
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:15,046
what happens when the SLA is missed. Does one department

229
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:19,006
owe the other department a refund? If it's a service provider

230
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:22,050
relationship. It might be something like that of just like just pay us in cash.

231
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,426
But perhaps as the SLA is

232
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:28,806
getting missed, something gets locked down. We don't allow changes for the next couple of

233
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:32,514
weeks while we sort out all this nonsense. Or maybe the software release cycle

234
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:36,438
gets automatically frozen for 28 days. It is good to agree

235
00:15:36,524 --> 00:15:39,798
those things before you hit the heat of the moment, that you're in

236
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:43,398
the middle of something going wrong and your coders are like, yeah, I think I've

237
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:46,970
got it. I think I can fix this immediately. But your

238
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,930
nurses are still phoning up and going, the records are not in the record.

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,294
What the hell is going on? So the SLA is the part

240
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:56,974
that is negotiations. Now, in a perfect world, this is

241
00:15:57,012 --> 00:16:01,450
defined by the business or customer, but in reality it is a conversation.

242
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,894
Normally I would not put technical phrases like well

243
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:08,210
formed HL seven in the SLA it would be a customer

244
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,758
outcome, but we'll come to that a little bit later in this session

245
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:15,198
when I talk about negotiations. Okay, so you're

246
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:18,600
going to have some slis and slos around code.

247
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,670
Hopefully that gives developers a sense of balance, something to measure opportunities

248
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,138
to add features and innovate against

249
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:31,610
clearing technical debt against business impact.

250
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,330
Now, code runs on infrastructure, so that can have customer experience

251
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,026
impacts as well. You have availability concepts of how

252
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:43,626
to support updates to the infrastructure in the same way that you want to update

253
00:16:43,658 --> 00:16:47,706
your code, updating operating systems, moving to different cloud or network providers,

254
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:50,814
adding new locations to better support remote customers.

255
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:54,894
These risks to availability and performance need to be balanced as

256
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:58,270
well. So excuse

257
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:02,382
me, this is our new dimensions. As we add the infrastructure dimension,

258
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:06,082
things get more complicated. You will be dealing with the full stack

259
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:09,190
and often multiple stacks in multiple locations.

260
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,398
In our hospitals, we had pretty much everything from

261
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:16,866
Windows client applications to Unix Labs and MQ systems

262
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:20,202
and mainframe and systems. And they're all scattered across a state

263
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,702
that is physically one third the size of mainland USA

264
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:27,850
in Western Australia, and by the way, not close to any cloud providers.

265
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,046
So networks mattered. Some of the nested slis around infrastructure,

266
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:37,050
they could be inherited slis from your cloud network or service providers.

267
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,894
Like for code, you want to avoid slos of data here, it's best to have

268
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:44,610
a single source of SLI truth for infrastructure.

269
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,674
What you're looking for is the infrastructure's ability to

270
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:52,770
support, load, and deliver predictable latency.

271
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,154
Now, we need to include some more things

272
00:17:57,192 --> 00:18:00,642
here. The impact of all the infrastructure components

273
00:18:00,706 --> 00:18:04,454
into the slis slo part of our nesting process.

274
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:07,382
So we look at the total transaction time as a way of doing that.

275
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:11,210
This would certainly have nested slis for each piece of the puzzle.

276
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,574
Can SLI for the labs update, leaving the lab hardware,

277
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:21,866
an SLI for the message queue, adding and leaving. Remember that first one that

278
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:25,374
I described in the start of this session? Can SLI for the

279
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:28,766
labs update, arriving at the patient record system. An SLI for traversing the

280
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:32,174
networks, an SLI for adding it into the patient record.

281
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:35,842
And you might even have an SLI for the database inserts on the patient record

282
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:39,406
system. You can get too crazy with slis.

283
00:18:39,598 --> 00:18:43,406
So define slis at sort of system boundaries or team boundaries,

284
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,194
so that there can be can extensive ownership there.

285
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:49,654
The strength of system boundaries is that they're less likely to

286
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:53,346
change, but it might be too detailed. The strength of team boundaries

287
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:56,950
is that you can assign responsibility more easily. Now,

288
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,106
for slos on infrastructure, you may want to

289
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:04,330
express the slos in the shape of performance curves. Here, we expect

290
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,862
the bulk to occur normally within 30 seconds,

291
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:11,294
well within the technical capabilities of the infrastructure. Right. It just needs

292
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,480
to be enough to keep the customer happy.

293
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,938
You don't want to set it so high that you're overspending

294
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:22,586
and under innovation, under innovative.

295
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,966
So, for example, where there's a high system load, you will see that we have

296
00:19:25,988 --> 00:19:29,650
a long tail here for about five minutes. At the top of the curve.

297
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,942
As we move to the SLA, negotiations with the customer, you see a big jump.

298
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:38,126
We're only committing to the five minute time with them.

299
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:42,086
And this came about after conversations with the ward nurses, and this is

300
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:45,894
a key aspect of what I'm talking about here, that once

301
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:49,654
we'd worked out, after we'd screwed up on the message queue and realized that we

302
00:19:49,692 --> 00:19:53,366
weren't making the nurses happy. And nurses are very clear when they're unhappy,

303
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:57,434
by the way. And I went out and

304
00:19:57,472 --> 00:20:00,874
talked to the nurses, I went out and watched what they did in the

305
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:04,334
wards, and I went down to the lab systems to see what these people were

306
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:07,550
actually doing so that we could build genuine measures for them

307
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,614
of what they actually cared about. So we asked them about time, and we

308
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:15,502
expected them to be like most customers, seeking instant response times.

309
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:19,278
But their view was different. They know it takes time for the samples

310
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:22,926
they takes to be delivered physically from the wards to the labs.

311
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,114
So they had a view of overall processing time. For them,

312
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:29,686
the time frame was about beating the time it took a nurse to

313
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:33,382
run from the ward to the Nat lab system when the system

314
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:36,166
was down. Now, that took about ten minutes.

315
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:39,340
So when we offers five minutes, they were happy.

316
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,114
That was an important lesson, and it

317
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:46,746
allowed us to avoid unnecessary infrastructure costs and

318
00:20:46,768 --> 00:20:50,230
other things. It doesn't always have to be as fast as possible,

319
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,222
just as fast as necessary. And of course, when I worked

320
00:20:54,276 --> 00:20:58,794
for banks on stock trading systems, it was different. The processing

321
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:02,206
time was a competitive differentiator for

322
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:05,794
the traders and as fast as possible. And never mind the cost

323
00:21:05,912 --> 00:21:09,202
was the approach. The dimensions of code

324
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:12,014
and infrastructure are not the full picture,

325
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,054
however. So let's talk about the third dimension,

326
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:18,838
the business and customer experience. And I saved the best for last.

327
00:21:19,004 --> 00:21:22,742
This third dimensions is the business, or if you're a nonprofit or a government

328
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:24,440
body, the customer experience.

329
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,590
This is about the revenue and or service production capabilities

330
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,940
of the application.

331
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:37,686
As we add the business dimension, it can become difficult to measure

332
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,438
the full experience. You will want to get out

333
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:46,190
to the customer interface, and that may require business

334
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,202
integration or mobile platform agents for availability.

335
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:53,762
And to track predictability of response times, you may want to add in

336
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:57,554
synthetic testing tools into your environment. I'm going to keep it a little

337
00:21:57,592 --> 00:22:01,202
simpler for our hospital example and

338
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:05,122
just talk about we're sort of just looking at

339
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:08,162
the doctor and nurse experience now.

340
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:10,998
We built and owned the patient record application,

341
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:14,674
the mainframe piece. So we knew we could add in our own specific measure

342
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:17,858
for that piece. And from observing the behaviors and the wards,

343
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:21,626
we worked out that the nurses had an instinctive expectation of when

344
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:25,420
the labs would come back. They would start looking at the record.

345
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,306
If the update wasn't, they'd open up the patient record and go,

346
00:22:29,328 --> 00:22:32,654
is the update there? And if they wasn't there, they would come back and try

347
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:36,394
again in a few minutes. Repeated record lookups

348
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:40,602
was our sign that we weren't meeting those instinctive expectations

349
00:22:40,746 --> 00:22:44,750
for the people in the ward, and soon they would be calling us to complain.

350
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,300
So we coded a repeat counter into our patient record application.

351
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:53,362
Now, why did we set up beyond 10 seconds in there as

352
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,530
part of the measure?

353
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,466
Well, we had just within five minutes at

354
00:23:02,488 --> 00:23:05,638
first, and then we had a problem. We kept missing the target even when the

355
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:09,094
records were processing fine. You see,

356
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:11,830
one or two of the nurses would not wait at all. They would just sit

357
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,222
there hitting enter again and again and again. So we added the beyond

358
00:23:15,286 --> 00:23:19,066
10 seconds as well as the sort of within five minutes to get

359
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:21,966
around those sort of crazy and patient ones so that we weren't getting beaten up

360
00:23:21,988 --> 00:23:23,950
for their behavior.

361
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,558
Now, the SLO here is

362
00:23:28,644 --> 00:23:31,966
a little different as we want a low number or zero as

363
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:35,554
the outcome. You might have expected a tiny percentage here, but the

364
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:39,646
SLO includes all the malformed transactions coming out of that crappy

365
00:23:39,678 --> 00:23:43,726
lab system. So we needed to be realistic with them. In fact, this SLO

366
00:23:43,918 --> 00:23:46,760
sort of best everything else in the system.

367
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,126
And again, the SLA had reaction room against the

368
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:54,582
SLO. So the eight hour timeframe came

369
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:58,182
from the nurses, as they thought in terms of their shifts that

370
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:01,686
know what happens in the time that I'm here in the ward.

371
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:04,922
So this three way approach, we were really starting to work

372
00:24:05,056 --> 00:24:08,634
with the customer towards their success, instead of

373
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:13,454
managing towards a metric or a contract or a specific piece

374
00:24:13,492 --> 00:24:16,906
of technology. Now, both parties were using the SLA

375
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:20,846
as a tool instead of a cardinal to beat each other up with. So of

376
00:24:20,868 --> 00:24:24,234
course there were many more slis and slas and slas.

377
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:27,838
In reality, with the service provider,

378
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:31,678
it's generally a fairly thick contracts. But remember, my goal here with the examples wasn't

379
00:24:31,694 --> 00:24:34,820
to match reality, but to step you through the thought process.

380
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,762
You need to consider all three dimensions for success. The slas

381
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:43,266
are not there to beat each other up. They are there to capture

382
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:45,030
the mutual understanding.

383
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:50,342
You reach the mutual understanding through negotiation.

384
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,626
Slis, slos, slas, error. Budgets are

385
00:24:53,648 --> 00:24:56,730
the tools to support negotiations.

386
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,482
Now, negotiating is a key skill for any

387
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:04,366
SRE. There are some great books out there,

388
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:08,014
although they can be a little contradictory sometimes getting to yes versus getting

389
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:12,106
to no. And many are targeted salesforce and closing

390
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:15,730
a deal. I'm personally, I'm a win win negotiator. I want everybody

391
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,954
to leave feeling like they won. That's not always possible.

392
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:23,998
So here's a few quick thoughts based on my experience around negotiation,

393
00:25:24,094 --> 00:25:27,494
and I'll say it again, negotiating is a key skill in

394
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:30,694
SRE. You may think that you just

395
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:34,280
need technology skills and no, there is more to being an SRE than that.

396
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,498
Now, know thyself is not a new idea. It was

397
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,814
carved into the temple of Apollo in Greece around the fifth century

398
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:47,034
BC. And knowing myself, it's the best place

399
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:50,602
to start. Consider your level of maturity as an SRe team

400
00:25:50,656 --> 00:25:53,806
and as the environment. How much can you control?

401
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:57,662
What risk can you absorb and the business survive and

402
00:25:57,716 --> 00:26:01,226
you keep your job? Is that risk spread evenly throughout

403
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:04,734
the year, or do you have peak periods, like a Black Friday or a Super

404
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:08,622
bowl, or a new year's Eve? Are you in a period of significant

405
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:12,274
transformation as an enterprise? Will things be the same in twelve months,

406
00:26:12,392 --> 00:26:15,990
or be slo different? As to make today's sois meaningless?

407
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,006
Use all this to gather your needs. You probably have a

408
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:22,998
feeling for what expectations the business will have.

409
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:26,658
Hopefully, what will you need to deliver

410
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:31,190
that expectation? Could you accept tougher slas

411
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,470
if you could grow your team or purchase supporting tools.

412
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,518
Now, when consulting, I try and brainstorm this to identify where my outer

413
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:42,074
boundaries are, what will be unacceptable,

414
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:46,110
or what will be too easy. Preparing to engage

415
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,720
is about gathering information. So what you want to do is

416
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,620
build a strategic model from your information.

417
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,210
There is a people factor here as well. So gather opinions about

418
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,190
the people that you will be negotiating with. What are their goals,

419
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,586
their aptitude to risk versus innovation,

420
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:11,014
even subtle things like what time of day? Are they more open

421
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:13,750
to ideas or in a better mood?

422
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,746
Also, because you're going to schedule your facilitations around that.

423
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,930
Also identify a facilitator.

424
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:25,194
If this is going to be you, then read up and practice ahead of time.

425
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:28,010
Facilitation is a very specific skill.

426
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,786
Consider bringing someone in. You can bring in a contractor or a

427
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:34,320
service partner who does this for a living.

428
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:38,426
Facilitation is a skill. Or it can be great to bring in a leader

429
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:42,410
from another part of the organization who you know is a natural facilitator,

430
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,034
who can park their own ego and needs and draw input from

431
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,610
everybody in the room or in the meeting.

432
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,926
And actually that can give that volunteer career profile

433
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:56,158
within the company as well. It'll let them see other sides

434
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,238
of the company and the other sides of the company to see them. So it

435
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:03,058
can be a win win. I said, I like win hints. Now it's

436
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:05,990
time to schedule the meetings and get on with your negotiations.

437
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,418
The negotiating meeting has a general flow, right? You have your warm up, and here

438
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:13,862
you set the scope for the discussion, the application, the dimensions,

439
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:17,414
the business value, and what they will get out of participating.

440
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:20,394
Be brief. They're all experts in some aspect here,

441
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,254
so you don't want to turn over every little stone yet. Just get everybody to

442
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:27,902
talk a little bit. Ask them to spend one or two minutes describing their

443
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,326
aspect. The nominator facilitator should

444
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:34,810
politely close down anybody who starts to exceed a brief introduction.

445
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,842
And that's why it's good to have sort of an outsider, that it doesn't create

446
00:28:37,896 --> 00:28:42,130
resentment in the room. It's just like people get controlled.

447
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,506
Then you hit your test drive, and that's where you present what some of the

448
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:48,726
indicators could under consideration, at least could

449
00:28:48,748 --> 00:28:52,774
be. Give one specific example of an SLI can

450
00:28:52,812 --> 00:28:55,862
SLO and SLA to clarify for them again.

451
00:28:55,916 --> 00:28:59,922
So in the same way that although pretty much everybody attending this conference

452
00:28:59,986 --> 00:29:02,230
would know the basics of slas,

453
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,586
SLA, I took one SLI to just step through to

454
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:10,726
make sure that you and I were working off a common understanding

455
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:14,058
of them. And you're testing the water when you do this in the negotiation.

456
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:17,518
So try to make this something that could live on your example,

457
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:20,990
Slis that could live on in the final agreement,

458
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,426
something real. Now you want to assess.

459
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:28,274
So you've test driven something with them, now they have something

460
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:32,180
to talk about and assess the business value. Is this the best place to start?

461
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,618
Will pursuing this scope give return on investment?

462
00:29:35,714 --> 00:29:39,458
If you're a revenue based organization,

463
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:42,742
do you need to balance innovation and risk on this application?

464
00:29:42,876 --> 00:29:46,770
What actions will be effective for missed slas?

465
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,026
Will you just freeze changes for a while to return to

466
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,994
stability, and if so, for how long? An important part

467
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:58,070
of this phase is extracting and capturing assumptions.

468
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,866
Clarifying assumptions is why footnotes on slas can

469
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:04,350
sometimes be longer than the actual SLA.

470
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:09,322
And don't be surprised if you end up that way. That the definitions and footnotes

471
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:13,390
explaining things in the SLA is more detailed than the SLA.

472
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,314
Then we reach the point of proposing. So now you have more information for

473
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:20,482
everyone, you've updated your test drive, you can make a new

474
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,962
proposal now. Now a few hints here.

475
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:26,362
Predictability is often more important than speed,

476
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:30,342
so the higher variance in response times, the more user experience is

477
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:33,798
negatively affected. If they know it's going

478
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:36,870
to take 60 seconds every time they can,

479
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,274
I don't know. Can you make a cup of tea of coffee in 60 seconds?

480
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:43,798
Probably not, but they know that that's coming. But if it's

481
00:30:43,894 --> 00:30:47,194
most of the time taking 15 seconds, and then, but every once in a while

482
00:30:47,232 --> 00:30:50,060
taking five minutes, that's a negative experience.

483
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,062
So avoid spreads that are greater than

484
00:30:54,196 --> 00:30:57,210
six standard deviations of the metric.

485
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:01,594
Assuming you have the metrics tracked already, greater than six standard negotiations

486
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:05,620
is an indication of low capability of process. It's not good.

487
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,666
And now you've proposed and we discussed it,

488
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:12,866
now you recur. Now you assess the new proposal like you did for the test

489
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:16,798
drive. You expect to iterate or recur through these takes,

490
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:20,562
as this is where the real negotiating occurs. You may need to schedule

491
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:24,006
follow up meetings now. For each meeting, always take a few minutes to

492
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:28,006
revisit the warm up, restate the scope and goal, recap the

493
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:31,850
conversations to date, and try to acknowledge something from each person

494
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,626
during that warm up piece. Again, during the warm up, you're trying to

495
00:31:35,648 --> 00:31:39,558
get them in the room and feeling

496
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:43,134
like they belong and that they are a participator because you want them

497
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:46,606
participating and feeling respected. Then of course,

498
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:50,014
the wonderful thing. Eventually you reach the agree. This is the

00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:53,754
final presentation of a finished SLI SLO SLAs

500
00:31:53,802 --> 00:31:56,950
for sign off. That doesn't have to be a physical signature,

501
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,290
but it is worth saying that you will need everyone to. As an example,

502
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,534
you need everyone to confirm the email. They will need to commit

503
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:06,898
on the record. If they're reluctant, it means you missed

504
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:10,150
something during the assess phase. Return to that

505
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,718
and try again. This is the

506
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:16,546
process of the negotiating meeting or meetings.

507
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:20,246
Sometimes this might only take ten minutes and sometimes it might

508
00:32:20,268 --> 00:32:23,658
take three or four meetings. Okay, so thanks for

509
00:32:23,664 --> 00:32:26,474
coming on that journey with me. Here's what I hope you take away from this

510
00:32:26,512 --> 00:32:30,102
session. Learn from my experience. Don't manage

511
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:34,074
to the metrics. Focus on the outcomes, the full transaction,

512
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:36,880
the complete process, the overall experience.

513
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,942
Don't use service levels to beat each other up.

514
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:45,220
Use them to become preemptive. Use them so that you can offer more services

515
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,314
ahead of time. And when you build out

516
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:52,722
your service levels, remember to assess them against the three

517
00:32:52,776 --> 00:32:56,230
dimensions. Are you seeing the full picture?

518
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,646
Is there some critical aspect that's being overlooked? One of the

519
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:04,118
most critical things around customer experience

520
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:07,926
that I have learned is predictability. With higher variance in

521
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:11,366
response times, the more user experience is negatively

522
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:14,714
affected. High variance is also an indicator, as I say,

523
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,666
of low capability process. So keep your eyes on the transactions that

524
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:22,634
are outliers. Outliers annoy the crap out of us

525
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:26,318
and they annoy the crap out of users as well. SLo finally

526
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:30,266
realize that if you want to be great at SRE, you will need negotiation

527
00:33:30,298 --> 00:33:33,674
skills. Negotiations is useful for life and it's useful

528
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,942
for SRE. So as I promised,

529
00:33:37,006 --> 00:33:40,846
here are some links on reading on similar topics.

530
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:44,578
SLO for those people who've swapped screens, this is the time to switch back to

531
00:33:44,584 --> 00:33:48,294
the screen and take a snapshot of the links here. You can catch up

532
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:52,086
with most of my thoughts on my website and if you

533
00:33:52,108 --> 00:33:56,006
found the session interesting, then please feel free to connect with me on

534
00:33:56,028 --> 00:33:59,634
LinkedIn or Twitter. I may have more interesting thoughts tomorrow.

535
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:03,606
You never know, so it might be worth a try.

536
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:07,670
This is not my first time with the session, so I

537
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,450
love feedback. Feedback would be great. So what caught your attention?

538
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,958
What was important that I missed? Because I'm sure there's something that

539
00:34:14,964 --> 00:34:18,686
I've left out. But with that, I want

540
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:22,222
to thank 42 and sre.com for hosting this session. I want to thank

541
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:25,834
you for your time today and I will see you in the Discord

542
00:34:25,882 --> 00:34:28,910
channels. You can reach out to me there as well if you wish.

543
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,734
I hope you have the rest of the event and the rest of your day

544
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:33,450
is fantastic.
