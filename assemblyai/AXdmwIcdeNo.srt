00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,642
Hi everyone, welcome to Con 42, DevOps Summit

2
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:46,258
2024. And I'm Sora Panda. And today I'm

3
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:49,746
going to give my thoughts on AI as a catalyst redefining

4
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:53,440
the resource management in DevOps. So let's dive in.

5
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,766
So today's agenda looks like this. First we are going

6
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:02,206
to go through a basic introduction of DevOps and evolution of

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,634
DevOps in the last decade. And then we'll talk about

8
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:09,330
how AI and infrastructure as code can work so well in

9
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,346
unison. And then we talk about application of AI in

10
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:16,926
automated optimization, enhancing security and error

11
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:20,934
detection and self healing. We'll have a couple of case studies to look into

12
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:25,190
how AI can actually work in real world at today's

13
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,462
so, I'm Saurav, I'm the founder and CEO of Cloud Code

14
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:35,174
AI. Cloud Code AI is building an AI enabled DevOps

15
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:38,794
platform which automates the resource management for you so you

16
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,446
as a developer can focus on building your product, adding more features to

17
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:46,000
it, rather than spending time on managing resources on the cloud.

18
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,726
We aim to help software development teams go

19
00:01:49,748 --> 00:01:53,506
to market faster and rapidly prototype and keep

20
00:01:53,528 --> 00:01:56,786
on building their product. Feel free to connect with me on any

21
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:59,780
of the social media platforms and let's dive in.

22
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,934
So firstly, what is DevOps?

23
00:02:04,062 --> 00:02:07,222
DevOps combines development and IT

24
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:11,042
operations for better collaboration, communication and integration

25
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:14,354
between software development and IT operation

26
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:17,710
teams in big firms. It aims to increase the speed,

27
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,754
efficiency and quality of software delivery while reducing the time to

28
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:25,386
market and failure rate of new releases. As you can see

29
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,014
in the diagram, DevOps is the union

30
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:32,682
of software development and operation. As a DevOps engineer,

31
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:36,686
you need to write code and also monitor your system and make sure

32
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:38,560
everything is running well.

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,500
Now this is a diagram which very

34
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,958
perfectly illustrates what is DevOps about. In the

35
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:52,202
world of DevOps, collaboration is not just a buzzword,

36
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:56,362
it's the backbone of our success. When development or operation team

37
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:59,774
unite, the magic of innovation and efficiency

38
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:03,698
truly happens. As you can see in the

39
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:07,422
DevOps pipeline, it's an infinite loop of planning, creating,

40
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:11,266
verifying, packaging and releasing your software and thereafter

41
00:03:11,298 --> 00:03:15,782
monitoring it. And this process keeps on happening. And using

42
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:19,426
the DevOps process we can ensure like what we are deploying

43
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:23,274
or redefining to the production is ready

44
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:26,986
to go there and there is no problem and customers have a

45
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:30,666
better experience. Now let's go through

46
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,554
a brief history of DevOps in past decade. So in

47
00:03:34,592 --> 00:03:38,314
2007, the concept of DevOps emerged to bridge the gap

48
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:42,222
between software development and it operations team. The aim was

49
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:45,934
to create a more integrated and efficient workflow where both teams could

50
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:49,794
work together towards a common goal. By 2010,

51
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:53,486
the term DevOps gained traction, especially on social media platforms

52
00:03:53,518 --> 00:03:56,974
like Twitter, where hashtag hash DevOps sparked lively

53
00:03:57,022 --> 00:04:00,514
debates and discussion among team. This showed that industry

54
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,846
was paying attention to DevOps, and it

55
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,966
was more than just a trend. In 2015,

56
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:10,258
DevOps was incorporated into scale agile framework,

57
00:04:10,354 --> 00:04:14,390
gaining more traction in the enterprise arena. And by 2016,

58
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,506
most of the high performing companies began adopting DevOps as the

59
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:22,054
new norm when deploying software. And by 2019,

60
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:25,502
enterprise began embedding more it functions such as security,

61
00:04:25,636 --> 00:04:30,282
privacy policy and data into their DevOps culture and processes.

62
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:33,550
So this is how DevOps has been evolving.

63
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,278
But in general,

64
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:40,846
DevOps consists of a lot of automation and involves a steep

65
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:43,906
learning curve to understand the current technologies. And there

66
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:47,442
are a lot of tools and technologies popping up every now and then.

67
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:51,590
Thus, convergence of AI and DevOps is a game changer and

68
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,510
let's see how it can change lot of aspects of DevOps.

69
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,066
Now the first thing is infrastructure as code. So what is infrastructure

70
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:03,814
as code? Infrastructure as code is a process of automating,

71
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:07,990
provisioning and configuring infrastructure using code and script.

72
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,330
It helps you increase the speed and efficiency of software deployment,

73
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,802
along with better documentation, increased scalability,

74
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:19,402
better collaboration, less human error, and ultimately

75
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,000
which results in improved customer experience.

76
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,654
Now, AI can actually have a great impact when it comes

77
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:32,854
to infrastructure as code. The traditional way

78
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:36,102
of creating infrastructure as code involves manually writing code

79
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:39,986
or relying on predefined templates, which can be time consuming

80
00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:44,026
and repetitive. However, AI has revolutionized this process

81
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:47,414
by allowing us to generate IAC code through simple natural

82
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:50,986
queries. This speeds up

83
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:54,590
the process and increases the productivity, allowing engineers to focus

84
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,834
more on the complex task of designing the architecture

85
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:01,866
rather than writing the code. Moving on to proactive assistance,

86
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:05,722
AI can optimize infrastructure design, identify areas

87
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:08,910
where costs can be reduced, and enhance overall operational

88
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,614
efficiency of the whole DevOps pipeline.

89
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:14,942
With AI's proactive assistance, our infrastructure structures

90
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:18,822
can be robust, cost effective and fine tuned for the specific

91
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:22,370
operational requirement. In the world of DevOps,

92
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,250
ensuring quality and security of the pipeline is of utmost

93
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,530
importance. AI acts as a vigilant overseer,

94
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,930
helping site reliability engineers ensure quality

95
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,650
and security of their DevOps pipeline.

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,324
Now this is a case study of generating serverless API using

97
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:47,404
natural language. Here you just need to pass a natural language

98
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:51,168
query of what you want to do and AI can automatically identify all

99
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:55,404
the resources needed, like DynamoDB, table lambda functions,

100
00:06:55,452 --> 00:06:58,548
and API gateway. It can configure the IM policy

101
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:02,432
necessary to connect each of these services internally,

102
00:07:02,576 --> 00:07:06,756
and then when you click on deploy, it can automatically create an

103
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:10,436
IAC file which is a terraform file and this is like a

104
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,816
400 line long terraform file generated in minutes. So you

105
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:17,716
can see how quickly AI can help you build things and speed

106
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:20,730
up the efficiency of your DevOps team.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,428
Now, automation in DevOps is like autopilot for an aircraft.

108
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:32,172
It doesn't replaces the pilot, but it empowers them to fly

109
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,776
higher, faster and with greater precision. AI is not

110
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:39,236
just a tool, but game changer that enables DevOps team to

111
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,704
adapt dynamically, predict demands and optimizing resources

112
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:46,416
with minimal human intervention. Infrastructure optimization

113
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:50,280
is crucial in managing IT infrastructure efficiently.

114
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,824
Teams can use AI insights in

115
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:58,420
adapting to usage pattern and anticipating demands,

116
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,960
and optimizing the infrastructure with minimal human intervention.

117
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,952
Teams can also utilize AI for resource optimization

118
00:08:07,096 --> 00:08:10,312
by analyzing the historical data, usage pattern

119
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:14,556
and performance metrics to optimize resource allocation and ensure efficient

120
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:18,624
use of infrastructure. One of the major contributions would be in

121
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:23,104
automating testings, where AI can automatically create test

122
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:26,888
costs and pass them through the testing pipeline,

123
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:30,100
helping you improve the speed and accuracy of the testing.

124
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,800
Now let's discuss the role of AI in improving security.

125
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,502
AI can analyze vast amount of code rapidly,

126
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,590
which is a game changer. It can quickly identify potential vulnerabilities

127
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,998
that might escape the human scrutiny,

128
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,970
enabling us to address these weaknesses before they can be exploited.

129
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,002
Moreover, AI spots these issues and suggests the improvement,

130
00:08:56,066 --> 00:09:00,150
streamlining the process of fortifying our digital defenses.

131
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,418
Moving on to compliance, which is equally critical.

132
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:08,006
Compliance checks are often time consuming and cumbersome,

133
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:11,494
but AI is transforming this narrative

134
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:15,414
by automating both the standard as well as user generated compliance

135
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:18,986
checks. AI speeds up development and ensures a high degree

136
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:22,654
of accuracy in adhering to regulatory standards set

137
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,966
by you and the open source community.

138
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:30,378
This automation is particularly valuable in today's

139
00:09:30,474 --> 00:09:34,194
fast paced development environments, where speed and compliance must

140
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:37,774
go hand in hand. Lastly, let's dwell

141
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:41,954
into access control and identity management in

142
00:09:41,992 --> 00:09:45,858
our interconnected world. Managing who has access to what paramounts

143
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:49,954
it's not only about humans, but it's also about the services and who is accessing

144
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:53,206
which services. So here, AI can step in

145
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:56,882
in revolutionizing IAM. By analyzing the usage pattern,

146
00:09:56,946 --> 00:10:00,474
behavior and connection between the services, AI can

147
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:03,802
generate dynamic IAM policies, ensuring that the right people

148
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:07,194
have the right access at the right time. This not only

149
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:11,114
tightens the security, but also enhances the operational efficiency

150
00:10:11,242 --> 00:10:12,640
of your whole product.

151
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,924
This is a case study which we created an IM policy generator for

152
00:10:18,962 --> 00:10:23,104
AWS. Here you can pass a natural language query asking what

153
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:26,416
type of services and what type of permissions you need

154
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:30,480
and AI can automatically create a least privilege

155
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,896
policy for you which you can copy and paste and use it in

156
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:38,048
your services. This is just like tip of the iceberg.

157
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:41,332
Imagine once the AI gets the access to all the data

158
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:44,912
of how the things are connected, it can automating, identify and give the limited

159
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,290
permission which the services need.

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,048
Now finally, we are at the last application

161
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:57,240
of AI, which is in error detection and self healing systems.

162
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,656
The concept of self healing in technology is a breakthrough in

163
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:05,084
its own sense, but aipowered self healing system will

164
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,430
represent a major leap of faith for the DevOps community.

165
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,624
These systems are designed to detect and resolve issues as

166
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:15,920
they arise automatically. This means significantly

167
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,652
less manual intervention, reducing downtime and enhancing

168
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:24,460
overall reliability of the system. Imagine a scenario

169
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,704
where system issues are addressed and resolved even before they are escalated

170
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:32,544
into a major problem. That's kind of proactive maintenance AI

171
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:36,144
brings into the table. The other aspect is predictive

172
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:39,716
analytics. The integration

173
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:43,588
of AI into DevOps monitoring tool isn't just about responding

174
00:11:43,604 --> 00:11:47,732
to issues, but it's also about predicting them. Through sophisticated

175
00:11:47,796 --> 00:11:51,356
algorithms, AI can analyze patterns and trends to

176
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:55,448
foresee potential system issues. This predictive capacity

177
00:11:55,544 --> 00:11:58,936
allows team to be notified, often before problems occur,

178
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,420
enabling them to take preemptive action.

179
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,984
Lastly, anomaly detection. Here is where

180
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:10,076
AI can truly shine. AI tools are adept at continuously

181
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:14,136
scanning engineering costs and data for any anomalies

182
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:18,660
or irregularities. Upon detection, these tools

183
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,204
can immediately initiate corrective actions, often without the need

184
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,740
for human intervention.

185
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,556
So AI truly has a lot of potential when it comes to error

186
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:36,120
detection and self healing systems.

187
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,856
So just to conclude, AI is going to be a big game changer when

188
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:49,348
it comes to it resource management. And there are going to

189
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:52,390
be a lot of AI powered tools coming into the market.

190
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,164
But one of the crucial issues which have always been there is

191
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:59,656
like a lot of tools have been popping up in DevOps and all of

192
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,748
them mostly have a steep learning curve. And the main goal,

193
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:07,384
main aim of the DevOps community should be in

194
00:13:07,422 --> 00:13:10,908
ensuring that the learning curve is brought down.

195
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:14,076
And we use AI to actually empower the team and

196
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:18,024
the DevOps and SRE engineers to actually build more resilient and reliable

197
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:22,104
systems and focus on building and designing infrastructure,

198
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:25,568
rather than doing the manual grunt work which is usually involved when

199
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:29,120
it comes to DevOps. So AI is going to

200
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,828
help a lot of DevOps team speed up the efficiency.

201
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:36,532
And you can also see lot of teams building and moving

202
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,312
faster in software development cycle.

203
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:43,044
And one more prediction would be like, you can see the cost

204
00:13:43,082 --> 00:13:47,668
of software going down pretty soon. So that is to conclude

205
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:52,292
this presentation and AI is truly going to revolutionize

206
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:55,944
how the resource management is done. And we

207
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:59,384
might also see like AI enabled AWS which can

208
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,148
be like you don't even say anything and it takes care of everything,

209
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:06,236
like assigning IP, assigning domain name,

210
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:10,204
connecting them and doing like AI software engineer of

211
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:14,316
its own. But I think that is a little bit in future. But there

212
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,750
is lot of scope and lot of hope.

213
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,912
