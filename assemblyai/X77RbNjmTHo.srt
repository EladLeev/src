1
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,274
How can you make a bigger impact in the world? How about getting a robot

2
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:45,718
to do some of your job for you? Well, this is going to be a

3
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:49,494
talk that talks about autonomous database and how you can

4
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:53,294
get Oracle to manage some of your databases in an

5
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:56,846
expert manner. I'm going to start with the

6
00:00:56,868 --> 00:01:00,160
DBA and autonomous in the cloud and how it works.

7
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,414
A robot may not look like one. Is an autonomous

8
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:08,322
database just a robot? How about Alexa? How about

9
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:11,966
Siri? We'll look at do you want to manage something that's

10
00:01:11,998 --> 00:01:16,014
more transaction processing related, getting rows

11
00:01:16,062 --> 00:01:19,286
very fast? Or do you want to do something more like a data warehouse where

12
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:23,414
I want columnar storage and where I can use the

13
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:26,642
entire column in memory instead of individual rows.

14
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,454
Then we'll look at machine learning and how it plays into all of

15
00:01:30,492 --> 00:01:34,106
this and get a copy of the notes. You can send me an

16
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:37,702
email. You could just go to conference 42 with DevOps

17
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:41,390
and they'll get it to you as well. I work for a company

18
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,926
called Viscosity. We focus on data, means the

19
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:48,074
database, data lake, you name it, Apex,

20
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:51,386
and apps on the front end of that then infrastructure,

21
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:55,822
whether it's Oracle cloud, whether it's Google Cloud, whether it's Azure,

22
00:01:55,966 --> 00:01:59,060
or whether it's AWS, we can help you.

23
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,346
We've got many Oracle aces on the Oracle side if you

24
00:02:03,368 --> 00:02:06,994
need more help there. Things are coming very

25
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:10,434
big in AI with Oracle, with the new vector database,

26
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:12,920
and we'll see a little on that at the end of this talk.

27
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,054
We wrote many of the books out there, not just Oracle Linux

28
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:22,650
you see there, and also things like ASM virtualization

29
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,394
and cloud storage. One thing to

30
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,962
note, if you are an Oracle DBA, be on at least 19 c.

31
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,086
That is a long term release of Oracle. The next one is

32
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:36,686
going to be 23. The releases in between there

33
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:40,094
are innovation releases where they show you some things

34
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,680
that you might test out.

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,866
When I look at autonomous database, is it going to take my job? And the

36
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:50,370
answer is some jobs are gone. Computers surpass them.

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,034
These operators work faster. Will they keep their job

38
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:57,766
if a switch is going to replace them? No. Rod emerging. Put it

39
00:02:57,788 --> 00:03:01,286
this way, the competition between man's mind and

40
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:05,302
the product of man's mind. And he was speaking about robots with this,

41
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:08,730
they're standing room only in the twilight zone.

42
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,562
I've seen robots at Oracle's conference maybe seven,

43
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:16,954
eight years ago and then again five years ago at

44
00:03:16,992 --> 00:03:20,618
more of their product conference. If you look at

45
00:03:20,624 --> 00:03:23,050
this robot, this is pepper the robot.

46
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,222
A thousand units of pepper being offered September years

47
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:32,062
ago, sold out in 1 minute. That's how you know something is

48
00:03:32,116 --> 00:03:35,634
hot. But it is time for workers to start

49
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:39,058
to worry about AI. For a

50
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:42,386
DBA, the workloads are increasing. As you see,

51
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:45,682
78% of the dbas have unplanned downtime.

52
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:48,710
95%. Automation is lacking.

53
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,886
Autonomous database is going to make this number go down where

54
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:57,030
there's automation everywhere. Two out of three dbas are struggling

55
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,850
to give full security protection.

56
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,930
The answer from Oracle, we're going to give you something,

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,038
a self driving, self securing, self repairing database.

58
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,340
Is that gonna leave me unemployed? I don't think so.

59
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,326
The autonomous database, you could see how serious they are with

60
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:19,454
their advertisements. I think the vendors think the cloud and

61
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:23,806
databases in the cloud, it looks like this, but really they

62
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:27,300
want to take you down this very narrow path to get there.

63
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,474
If you go quickly, sometimes it's very dangerous and you got to be very

64
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:34,894
careful. But I can tell you this, with the cloud, a few

65
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:38,914
years later, it looks like this, especially with autonomous

66
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:42,182
database. A long time ago,

67
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:45,698
and I mean probably a decade ago, economist magazine

68
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:49,010
has talking, actually 2017,

69
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,634
talking about how data driven organizations are much more

70
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:56,054
productive, much more likely to find customers and retain

71
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:59,514
them. And if you look at it, it makes sense, because if you look

72
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:02,734
at how to make an impact, the better you know

73
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:06,586
your customer, the better you can find customers, the more effective

74
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:10,846
you're going to be. As I have more and more data,

75
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:14,450
I start to get where a very small population,

76
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,220
kind of like a survey, gives me a very high result

77
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,522
in what I'm trying to give to my customer. But data is

78
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,966
often very big. The volume is high, coming at

79
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:30,534
me very fast, velocity is fast, different values of

80
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:35,010
data. A lot of people don't take that into account. Different varieties.

81
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,374
People sometimes use different databases and maybe

82
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:42,346
they cloud do it with the same database and then different truths of data.

83
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:45,786
How accurate is this data? I could

84
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:49,958
do each database individually, or I could use Oracle's converged database.

85
00:05:50,134 --> 00:05:53,378
Oracle gives me relational JSON key value graph

86
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:57,790
spatial files. Now we're moving into where they have a vector database.

87
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,614
And if I look at that, you can see all of the features that are

88
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,766
already built into that. If we look

89
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:08,466
at IoT, it's another thing that's coming very fast. We don't have a lot of

90
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:11,986
security sometimes in IoT because it's a very small

91
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:15,394
device that you can't store as much. So you got to be a little more

92
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:19,480
careful what you have there. But this is just going to add more data.

93
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,670
I can go to my refrigerator, and my refrigerator might say,

94
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,254
I've talked to the bathroom scale, and unless you order

95
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,898
some of these vegetables, we're locking the refrigerator on you.

96
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:34,140
This is reality in the world we're living now.

97
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,300
But big data took us from we used to say, what happened?

98
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,762
Why did it happen?

99
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:44,910
The could happen. Give me a prediction

100
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,214
now. We could say, what's the best thing that can happen? So if we do

101
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:53,470
things right with data, we'll do prescriptive analytics.

102
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,186
Prescribe what needs to happen for the

103
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,994
best solution, for us to hit our numbers

104
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:04,210
or for us to solve the problems we're trying to solve.

105
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,190
Emerging jobs you could see data engineer

106
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,206
DevOps if I can handle twice as

107
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:16,162
many databases because I use autonomous database,

108
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:20,010
how much better am I going to be at this job of data engineer?

109
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,234
But also in the world of machine learning, the data scientist is

110
00:07:24,272 --> 00:07:27,722
only 20% of the job and the other

111
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:31,610
80%. The most of it is a DBA,

112
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,560
but a lot of it is also a developer as well.

113
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,890
The robot may not look like one. As I said earlier,

114
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,506
alexa, Siri, they're robots. They don't

115
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,158
complain. They work 24/7 they never ask for a raise.

116
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:49,906
Well, they ask you for whoever sells them ask for more.

117
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:53,666
Their autonomous database is really a robot. It just doesn't get up and

118
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:57,410
walk around. Self healing.

119
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,414
How about a database that can put the patch on before I even know

120
00:08:01,452 --> 00:08:04,770
there's a security risk? Self driving

121
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,454
manages all the dials that I need to do. Self tuning

122
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:12,390
as it finds things that are problematic. Self recovering,

123
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,574
self administrating it came out with Oracle's

124
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:18,380
18 C database over five years ago.

125
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,406
The reality though is will your job change if you

126
00:08:23,428 --> 00:08:27,006
use this? I hope so. I hope it will help you to

127
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:30,110
find more time, help you to manage more databases.

128
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,706
Should get you closer to the business and innovation. Maybe you

129
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:37,810
go into the data side, be more of a data manager.

130
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,774
Autonomous database spreads to online transaction processing

131
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:47,574
so Oracle has an autonomous data warehouse which was very good for

132
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:51,094
analytics, did columnar storage and

133
00:08:51,132 --> 00:08:54,674
also in memory queries. Automatic transaction

134
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:57,602
processing made transaction processing faster,

135
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:01,014
faster at the row level. So am I doing a report where

136
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:05,666
I'm summing up columns and comparing things, or am I looking for individual rows?

137
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:09,982
Oracle created a database that is going to be perform

138
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:14,190
and tuned for that application specifically.

139
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,150
The other thing is it withstands errors.

140
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,350
Server outage well, real application clustering rack

141
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,740
also gives you multiple servers. Going to the same

142
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,898
database gives you availability. Also has

143
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:34,354
autonomous data or active data

144
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:38,290
guard that allows you if one there's an outage in a region.

145
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,150
Now all of a sudden it's going to fail over takes seconds of time.

146
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,766
Rack I could tell you is pretty much automatic. You don't even

147
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:49,434
notice data corruption. I can use data guard to

148
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:52,566
recover it has well patches,

149
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,946
rack and so on. So another thing it does

150
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:59,062
for me is gives me an incredible SLA.

151
00:09:59,126 --> 00:10:02,234
99.995 is amazing with

152
00:10:02,272 --> 00:10:05,726
data guard. What about the

153
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:09,134
autonomous database in the future? Well, first of all, I always

154
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:13,006
tell people before you go there, make sure

155
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:16,546
who's tuned it before it gets to the cloud, because you want it

156
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:19,746
to be has fast as possible because you'll pay less for

157
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:24,082
the cloud. Who makes sure the vendor is

158
00:10:24,136 --> 00:10:28,398
charging me correctly for the Cloud? A lot of people make mistakes when they order.

159
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,846
They buy the cloud and they're not watching what's costing them

160
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:34,918
money. They don't shut things down when it can save money.

161
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:38,874
Who builds the policies? Who makes sure the security is

162
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:42,154
working correctly? The answer is the

163
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:45,514
DBA. The DevOps person is going to set that

164
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:48,906
up. So how easy is it? Well, first of all,

165
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:53,094
it's free. Cloud oracle.com try it or cloud slash

166
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:57,226
free and you create your first autonomous

167
00:10:57,258 --> 00:11:00,654
database here. Here I go to it

168
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:04,298
and it shows you what you get for it. Compared to AWS,

169
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:07,934
I get two databases instead of one. I get four instances

170
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:11,186
instead of one. I get 200 gigs of

171
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:15,006
block volume instead of 30, ten gigs of object storage instead of

172
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:18,600
five. So you get a lot and it's free.

173
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,398
We'll ignore that. Get started for free ATp oracle.com

174
00:11:29,484 --> 00:11:33,050
cloud slash free when I sign up gives payment

175
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,346
information I always want to know when I sign up for something,

176
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:40,534
how do I end it? And the answer is your account automatically

177
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:44,590
gets decommissioned. So free cloud will continue on

178
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,854
as long as you're using it. There's no limit to it, but it does give

179
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:51,134
you the first 30 days where you can use all

180
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:55,086
the different things within the Oracle cloud, and you

181
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:58,962
put in your account information, your name, your email, and pretty soon

182
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,354
you can see all these new features you could try out now with

183
00:12:02,392 --> 00:12:05,842
the free version, you could do the cloud in the exact

184
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:08,850
number of databases, instances I showed you earlier.

185
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,918
But in the first 30 days you could try all these different things. I want

186
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:16,440
to try some big data, I want to try some AI type of things.

187
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,702
As I said, you could do autonomous data warehouse autonomous transaction

188
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:25,146
processing I'm going to show you jSon in a

189
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:29,062
minute, but basically you could see the hamburger

190
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:32,826
icon here. You click and you get a pull down menu where

191
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:36,474
I could either do things at the block level, I could do autonomous database.

192
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,306
And this shows how I look at autonomous databases.

193
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:44,366
And there's some of the things that I would set up on the right that

194
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,778
I might want to know. When 19 C came out,

195
00:12:47,864 --> 00:12:51,460
this is five years ago, they already had it on 18 c.

196
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,682
Larry Ellison said, we're going to automatically tune it. So with autonomous

197
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:59,862
transaction processing, he literally made

198
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:04,450
it so machine learning will look and monitor potential

199
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,450
indexes. Do I need new indexes? How does the execution

200
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:11,786
plan work? Do I want to go a different way? And it

201
00:13:11,808 --> 00:13:14,854
would change it if it was needed, has to be tested,

202
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:18,380
validated, et cetera. Of all the different sqls on the system,

203
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,202
how hard is it? Well, basically create an ATP database.

204
00:13:24,266 --> 00:13:27,854
Click on that when you're ready. Once I do

205
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:31,422
the free version, I first of all get on the cloud. Once I log

206
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:34,626
in there, I'll see that menu. When I go

207
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:39,586
to create that database, it's going to ask me what

208
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:40,900
I want to call that,

209
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,070
whether I want to do transaction processing or data warehousing,

210
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,534
what version I want to have it on, and then some

211
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:54,070
administrative privileges.

212
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,878
If you are a current Oracle customer, you bring your own license

213
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:03,686
and save money with this too. Now the free version,

214
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:07,254
you don't need any of it. Autonomous transaction processing

215
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:09,660
to provision a database, two minutes,

216
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,854
70% growth rate in Oracle's first Q four after

217
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:17,406
they release this, stop the database. All I do is

218
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:21,070
go up here, more action. Stop. Are you sure you want to stop it?

219
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,402
Stopping. Stopped. Very simple to use.

220
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:28,466
How long did that take? Provisioned it in two minutes.

221
00:14:28,648 --> 00:14:31,758
Got it built two minutes. Once I knew the settings

222
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:34,734
I want stopped the database, 25 seconds.

223
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:37,846
Restarted. 30 seconds. I can scale it.

224
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:41,174
Oh, I've got one cpu to start with here.

225
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:44,854
Let's scale it up to two. Now all of a sudden it goes

226
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:48,462
to two. Once it's available, as it's scaling,

227
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:52,330
can also stop and start a database in 40

228
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,260
seconds. So it shuts it down and it restarts it.

229
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,474
You can see, very easy to do this,

230
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:01,390
just pulling up a pull down menu.

231
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,834
Restart, stop, start, whatever you want. You also can have an auto

232
00:15:05,882 --> 00:15:09,198
start stop schedule that you could set up as well.

233
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:12,910
So this thing is unbelievably easy to use,

234
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,114
free to try. What else is in there?

235
00:15:16,232 --> 00:15:19,490
I can cloud the database, do a full clone.

236
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,602
Everything included in this database is somewhere else in another place.

237
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:27,534
Or I can do a refreshable clone. This is my main database.

238
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:30,118
I'm going to keep updating it. I'm going to build a clone, but I want

239
00:15:30,124 --> 00:15:33,382
to make it refreshable. So this one refreshes it every

240
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:36,614
seven days in this case, or within seven days

241
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:40,274
rather. I also could go to database

242
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:44,006
actions, do SQL to my database and

243
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,634
you cloud, see some of the other. I can do rest objects, I can do

244
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:50,762
JSON and so on. There's several choices in here of things

245
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,818
I can do. I'll show you a few more in a minute.

246
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:57,342
There's also a performance hub, what's taking a long

247
00:15:57,396 --> 00:16:00,640
time, how many users are doing things, what are they using?

248
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,506
There's also a service council where I can look at activity and I can look

249
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:08,802
at individual pieces of SQL and how long it's taking

250
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:12,626
of database time or I o time or cpu and so

251
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:15,762
on. Could also

252
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:19,686
do provision a database for autonomous data warehouse. So we just

253
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:23,446
saw autonomous transaction processing. So is data warehouse any harder or

254
00:16:23,468 --> 00:16:27,474
easier? Took all of a minute and 20 seconds to provision. That means

255
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:31,574
create it. But I find autonomous

256
00:16:31,622 --> 00:16:35,226
database is very optimized depending on what

257
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:39,462
you set it to. So autonomous database originally

258
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:43,840
was autonomous data warehouse, built for

259
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,886
things like columnar storage and doing calculations and

260
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:52,042
doing analytics and things like that. But then they came out with ATP,

261
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:55,378
autonomous transaction processing that worked more at the record

262
00:16:55,464 --> 00:16:58,740
level and it had automatic indexing as well.

263
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,842
And here's just some more examples of different

264
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:07,254
ones. One optimizes complex I'm looking at

265
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:10,680
a lot of information, summarizing data maybe

266
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,246
of a whole field or computing all the

267
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:17,966
salaries, whereas autonomous transaction processing

268
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:21,210
response time. I'm looking for just one salary.

269
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,902
Columnar format autonomous data warehouse

270
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:28,630
row format for autonomous transaction processing

271
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,074
creates data summaries, creates indexes

272
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:35,582
and does auto indexing. Memory is

273
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:39,642
unbelievably fast for columnar in memory storage

274
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:43,950
and querying things in autonomous data warehouse.

275
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,462
And the memory is used generally for caching individual records.

276
00:17:48,606 --> 00:17:51,986
When I look at autonomous transaction processing. So depending on

277
00:17:52,008 --> 00:17:55,782
which one you want to go to, you pick one or the other

278
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,190
if you have something more in between. I tend to go with ATP

279
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,058
compared to Amazon. As I talked about earlier,

280
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:09,074
if you have things in memory, if you have a lot of

281
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:12,650
performance tuning type of features built into the product,

282
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,994
and automatic tuning, it's going to be faster and

283
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:19,562
the price is going to be a lot lower when you

284
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:23,470
look at the cost of what you're producing,

285
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,246
whereas Amazon, I mean, obviously you

286
00:18:29,348 --> 00:18:32,554
buy a lot more cpus and do the same

287
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,854
thing. Maybe you're doing at Oracle, but with Oracle

288
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,060
your price performance is substantially better.

289
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,620
My benefits,

290
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,414
patching, automatic patching is probably the biggest one.

291
00:18:47,452 --> 00:18:50,626
I think it takes a lot of time for people. Automatic tuning

292
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:54,406
is another one. But most of all, you get to sleep at

293
00:18:54,428 --> 00:18:58,022
night. Here's all some of the best

294
00:18:58,076 --> 00:19:02,122
features. We'll say automatic provisioning, you saw it under

295
00:19:02,176 --> 00:19:05,514
two minutes. Automatic configuration of all the different

296
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:08,218
things to optimize for the workload you want.

297
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:11,914
Automatic indexing, automatic scaling

298
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:15,694
if I want to do that, automatic data protection, things like

299
00:19:15,732 --> 00:19:18,830
patches, automatic security backups, patching.

300
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,860
Security is encryption, by the way, that's built in as well.

301
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,682
Detection and resolution. It's always looking for

302
00:19:27,736 --> 00:19:31,742
different issues as well to try to solve those and then automatic failover

303
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:35,154
to other regions if needed. It also

304
00:19:35,192 --> 00:19:39,234
has a cost analysis. I can go to billing and costs when I have autonomous

305
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:42,706
database and then this will tell me what I'm doing and maybe I'll

306
00:19:42,738 --> 00:19:46,294
shut some down or close some databases to lower the cost

307
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:50,406
over time for a given month. There's not just ATP

308
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:54,246
and ADW, but there's also autonomous JSON database.

309
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:57,834
It's not covered here. And there's also Apex, which is a front

310
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:01,482
end application. Roughly 2 million people working

311
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:06,830
on that, currently building

312
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,158
applications. I forget how many applications a day it was, but it

313
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:14,430
was substantial. Create and run notebooks in Oracle

314
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,142
if you're not familiar with notebooks. Some people use Jupiter,

315
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:22,386
some people use Zeppelin, Oracle has Zeppelin. But there is

316
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:25,010
a way to use Jupyter as well through Oracle.

317
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,002
But basically I'm listing SQL or PL SQL

318
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:33,190
or something, or could be Python.

319
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,106
And then I'm querying that data and I want to graphically show it

320
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:45,030
and I do it all within a notebook. So I have a list of sequentially

321
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:49,286
listed statements. Then I could do graphical analysis.

322
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:53,246
But what I think people really need now is predictive and

323
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:56,494
prescriptive analytics. And I talked about how

324
00:20:56,532 --> 00:21:00,814
that is, and this is an old twilight zone where

325
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:03,200
this guy could predict what you need.

326
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,514
But we're really moving to prescriptive now with AI and

327
00:21:08,552 --> 00:21:11,826
advanced machine learning. And I'm going to show

328
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:15,874
you a little more on Oracle's machine learning. But if you look here in the

329
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:19,606
Oracle autonomous transaction processing we're looking at here and

330
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:23,382
going to development, we have Apex, which I talked about over

331
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:27,254
2 million apps I think built a year. We also

332
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:30,934
could use Oracle developer, but we also have machine learning notebooks.

333
00:21:30,982 --> 00:21:34,666
And I'm going to talk a little more about that. And then here's just a

334
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:37,654
dashboard as well of different performance metrics,

335
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:41,290
alerts and so on. Let's go into that machine learning now.

336
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,322
What does it give me? Well, first of all, all kinds of documents

337
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:49,006
to learn about it, create jobs to do things and so on.

338
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:52,814
I can just run some SQL or SQL scripts, or I could build

339
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:56,578
a whole notebook or set jobs up. But some of

340
00:21:56,584 --> 00:22:00,062
the examples that are out there are either in Python

341
00:22:00,206 --> 00:22:03,762
or SQL. Could also do it in r, but things like

342
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:06,850
classification, things like anomaly detection,

343
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,258
association roles. Here's some more Python,

344
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:12,150
just to give you some examples.

345
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,014
If you do go into machine learning, first, it's what's the business problem

346
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:21,034
I'm trying to solve? What is the function here

347
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:24,906
on the right that I want to perform? And then what algorithm do

348
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:28,570
I want to use? So let's say I want to classify data into

349
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,282
good bad customers, or, I don't know, maybe three groups,

350
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:34,270
or maybe it's age groups.

351
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,118
So has my problem. I want to know my good and bad customers.

352
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:42,430
Then what function do I want to use? Oh, I'll use classification.

353
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,262
What algorithm do I want to use? Maybe I'll use support vector

354
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:50,866
machine. I'll show you the algorithms and

355
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:54,194
the functions. In a moment, though. I want to build and

356
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:57,746
train the model with data I have because I know what

357
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:01,590
my good or bad customers are. And then I'm going to go and

358
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,382
test and I do that with 60%, train the model

359
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:08,182
and then the other 40%. I'm going to say,

360
00:23:08,316 --> 00:23:11,858
how well did this algorithm do? Should I use a different one?

361
00:23:12,044 --> 00:23:15,562
But you can see some of the functions. Am I looking to classify data?

362
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:19,354
Maybe I want to cluster big data into age groups, or maybe

363
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:22,606
I want to look through customers to see any anomalies that are out there.

364
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:26,250
What makes a very good or bad customer? What makes a potential

365
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,646
security risk regression? Or maybe I

366
00:23:29,668 --> 00:23:33,134
want to do predictive analytics and then

367
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:36,562
do prescriptive analytics after I find the answer

368
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:40,386
of how to fix that. Or maybe I want to find the attributes of

369
00:23:40,408 --> 00:23:44,082
good or bad customers. These are things I want to do in machine learning,

370
00:23:44,136 --> 00:23:48,142
but I have to define well what I want to do. Not target

371
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:51,558
the best customer, it's what makes the best customer. You have

372
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:54,774
to know what makes a best customer for you. Is it how much they

373
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:58,262
buy? How often they buy? Do they buy in the right season?

374
00:23:58,326 --> 00:24:02,474
Do they buy highly profitable items for you? Whatever that

375
00:24:02,512 --> 00:24:05,386
is, that's where you're going to classify into good and bad customers.

376
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:09,900
Maybe it's age groups and

377
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,498
I'm going to go to big data. Let's consider this big data. Maybe we'll

378
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:18,334
separate things into age groups. After I find

379
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:21,678
my best customers by age group, I'll go to big data and see if I

380
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:25,140
could find some of those same age groups and customers.

381
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,770
Now let's look at an algorithm. What is an algorithm? It's just math.

382
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,802
We don't have to do any of the math. Somebody wrote it 50 years ago.

383
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:38,646
Some of it goes back to the 18 hundreds. But anomaly detection says,

384
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:42,294
make a circle around all the good data and the

385
00:24:42,332 --> 00:24:46,150
outliers are out here. Maybe it's fraud, maybe it's something

386
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,500
else. Maybe it's a good customer or a bad customer.

387
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,810
But whatever it is, I'm looking for an anomaly.

388
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:56,774
There's also support vector, linear support vector

389
00:24:56,822 --> 00:25:00,010
machine. And this is a support vector machine, SBM,

390
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,766
where I separate good and bad customers, not by the green line,

391
00:25:04,948 --> 00:25:08,654
not by the blue, but by the red line. So future points will

392
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:12,206
land on the right side, hopefully. So a

393
00:25:12,228 --> 00:25:16,450
one class support vector machine looks for anomaly detection

394
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,554
now within Oracle. And you're not going to learn machine learning here. I'm just

395
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:25,218
showing you that once I build an autonomous database, I could start to

396
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,822
do machine learning. So I want to maybe select

397
00:25:28,956 --> 00:25:31,880
star from customers means select all the customers.

398
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,246
And then I also have ways in the settings to then graph all

399
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,418
of those customers. And I could pick the kind of graph. Obviously I have a

400
00:25:39,424 --> 00:25:43,670
bar graph here, but I could stack things into different colors

401
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,386
by the marital status of the person.

402
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:50,990
And then it also shows what year they were born.

403
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,166
Let's go one step further. How did I build the

404
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:58,638
anomaly detection? Well, have to have

405
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:02,858
some algorithm if this is the best one. There's more than one

406
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:06,414
support vector machines. A little bit of SQL

407
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:10,098
here. I'm going to put some settings into there, and then I'm going to

408
00:26:10,104 --> 00:26:14,914
go and call that algorithm and say the

409
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:18,866
probability from this customer table that it's

410
00:26:18,898 --> 00:26:22,038
null, which means it's anomaly. Then I want

411
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:26,200
you to graph that. So I do a bar graph in this case again.

412
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,302
Or I could change my SQL to say, what are the attributes making

413
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,394
them anomalous? And I could find that very quickly.

414
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,234
You're not going to learn machine learning here. You're not going to learn SQL here.

415
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:41,658
You could see if I build an autonomous database

416
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,278
now, I could write SQL and start to build machine learning

417
00:26:45,364 --> 00:26:47,920
inside. And it's not a lot of lines of code.

418
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,590
Here's another example of an algorithm

419
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,866
decision tree algorithm maybe. I'm a lawyer and I

420
00:26:56,968 --> 00:27:00,338
want to decide whether I should take a case or not. They're offering me a

421
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:03,854
settlement of $30,000. Well, if I proceed,

422
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:07,538
I may win, I may lose. There may be costs, there may be damages.

423
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:11,446
If I win, there may be lower or

424
00:27:11,468 --> 00:27:15,286
higher damages. Should I proceed? What the

425
00:27:15,308 --> 00:27:18,746
decision tree algorithm will do is calculate all of

426
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:22,374
these paths of this tree and say, overall, you're losing

427
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:24,810
$2,500. Take the settlement.

428
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,478
How's the code look? Not that you're going to learn it all, but let's

429
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:34,910
see how easy it is. First of all, these first three are just comments.

430
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:40,270
Then I'm using an algorithm that's a decision tree algorithm.

431
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,274
Then I say the function I want to do is

432
00:27:44,312 --> 00:27:48,482
classification. In this case, I'm going to classify whether somebody

433
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:52,162
will buy the Chicago Bears logo credit

434
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:55,714
card. Are they going to buy it? Then I want to

435
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:59,666
take that data. I have a list of data. Some people are very likely

436
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:03,206
to buy it, and some people are not at all likely, and you end up

437
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:07,254
with, oh, there's the Bears fans, and these are packers fans or

438
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:10,202
something else. But very quickly, what do I do?

439
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:14,042
I give my salesperson a list that they could very

440
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:17,978
quickly look at and say, what part of the list should I focus

441
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,720
on? What are the Glengarry leads there?

442
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:25,390
Other algorithms include time series algorithms.

443
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,030
Sales are very seasonal.

444
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,494
Airbnbs fall around events that are

445
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:36,334
happening. You can also do exponential smoothing,

446
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,542
time series algorithm, where you do single or double exponential

447
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:44,114
smoothing to smooth out that very rough stock market line

448
00:28:44,152 --> 00:28:46,760
to a smoother or very smooth line.

449
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,382
What do you want to do? Do you want to classify things

450
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:54,694
where you have all of these algorithms that are out

451
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:58,618
there, separate maybe into good and bad customer? Do you want

452
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:01,770
to cluster data? Oh, by age groups have

453
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,674
several algorithms here. K means is separate them

454
00:29:05,712 --> 00:29:09,354
by distance, o cluster means separate them by

455
00:29:09,392 --> 00:29:12,846
density. I want to do anomaly detection. You'll see in

456
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:16,954
the later version. There's more than one algorithm there, time series.

457
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:20,714
I want to do regression. Not just simple regression,

458
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:24,126
but very complex regression. Once I

459
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:27,922
find those good customers, wouldn't it be nice to find the attributes that

460
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:31,362
made them good customers? What are the people

461
00:29:31,416 --> 00:29:35,174
buying together? Maybe I cloud build a chatbot to ask them, do they

462
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:38,662
want to buy part b? Because everybody who bought part a

463
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:42,850
wanted part b. So you know that with association rules,

464
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,474
a priori algorithm, specifically Oracle

465
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:50,826
has many predictive queries and SQL analytics built in.

466
00:29:50,848 --> 00:29:54,378
They've written them for the last 30 years. Do I want to

467
00:29:54,384 --> 00:29:57,786
do feature extraction or text mining support?

468
00:29:57,968 --> 00:30:01,486
Things like Chat GPT have to do with text? We'll look at that a little

469
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,910
bit later. There's also statistical functions.

470
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,302
What kind of machine learning algorithms are used in healthcare? Well, guess what?

471
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:14,466
They did a graph. The guy just read articles and I

472
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:18,740
had the computer read them and figure out, do they ever say

473
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,326
any of these algorithm names and they did support vector machine.

474
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:26,594
I wonder why. Neural network.

475
00:30:26,722 --> 00:30:30,214
Maybe we're doing image classification, looking for tumors or something like

476
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:34,306
that. There's also auto

477
00:30:34,338 --> 00:30:38,818
machine learning. I did a machine learning notebook,

478
00:30:38,994 --> 00:30:42,646
took me maybe two, three days. I went to auto

479
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:46,314
machine learning, tried the same one. You could see how quickly it

480
00:30:46,352 --> 00:30:50,314
does it. It can try every algorithm for you,

481
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,320
tell you the accuracy of that,

482
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:57,578
and then it can say, create the notebook. I said okay, and created

483
00:30:57,594 --> 00:31:00,682
the notebook. And there's my answer in Python.

484
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:04,020
The entire notebook is built in four minutes,

485
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,700
something that took me two or three days. Amazing.

486
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,746
There's also auto machine learning. So what do you want

487
00:31:11,768 --> 00:31:15,666
to do? Is the biggest issue? Do people in

488
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:19,366
your company have algorithmic business thinking, so they

489
00:31:19,388 --> 00:31:23,762
know they want to classify things or cluster things, or look for anomalies,

490
00:31:23,906 --> 00:31:27,554
or find out what people buy together, or look for

491
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:31,590
regression, not simple regression, like a straight line, but complex

492
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,418
regression. What are they trying to do exactly?

493
00:31:35,584 --> 00:31:38,842
But machine learning is big machine learning.

494
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:42,446
I can have supervised means. I have some data to train it, as we

495
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:46,334
saw earlier. Maybe I'm going to classify that

496
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:50,350
data and look for fraud. Or I have some data, I'm going to train

497
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,446
that data. 60% of the data use 40% to

498
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:58,098
pick the right algorithm. Then I'm going to do image classification. We're going

499
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:00,958
to build an autonomous car. Maybe I'm going to do regression,

500
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:04,100
forecast the weather or forecast my own market.

501
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,306
Maybe I don't have the data. Somebody just gives me some

502
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:12,626
data. I want to just cluster it into targeted marketing of age groups.

503
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:16,214
There's all kinds of ways to use this. You have to know what

504
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:20,090
your business needs the most. But with Oracle,

505
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,874
everything in autonomous runs on exadata, which means

506
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:28,650
it's multi tenant, so it could separate different business

507
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,218
units into different places physically from each other.

508
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:36,954
It does in memory database, where it can put the entire database

509
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:40,606
in memory, but with autonomous data warehouse, it'll also

510
00:32:40,788 --> 00:32:45,022
put columns of data in memory. Real application cluster

511
00:32:45,086 --> 00:32:48,786
allows me to fail over to other nodes automatically, so I have

512
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:52,482
multiple nodes going to the same instance. Active data

513
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:56,014
guard gives me recoverability so I can clone

514
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:59,750
something somewhere and then send that last bit of data over.

515
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,470
If one region fails and I go into another one, partitioning makes

516
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,674
everything faster because I cloud now, segment my data into smaller

517
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:13,014
pieces to not look at all of it. Then they also have things called storage

518
00:33:13,062 --> 00:33:16,426
indexes, where they're building indexes on the

519
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:19,546
fly and also putting things in memory on

520
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:22,926
the fly. Don't want to write it yourself?

521
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:26,346
Well, guess what? I could use Oracle analytics that's

522
00:33:26,378 --> 00:33:30,030
not free. Machine learning is free with autonomous database.

523
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,878
But I could use Oracle analytics, and it's very graphical

524
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:39,470
and very intuitive

525
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,786
for the people that are using it. If you write it right, you could see

526
00:33:42,808 --> 00:33:46,262
all the different kind of graphs. It's not just a pie chart and a bar

527
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:49,910
graph. I could do a tree map graph where I'm putting

528
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,954
things to show different quarters. Obviously, my quarters

529
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:57,270
are getting smaller. That's not good. Maybe, unless it's losses.

530
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,734
There's also much more complex. Maybe I want to look quarter by quarter,

531
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:09,574
but by customer group. And maybe the profit

532
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:13,066
is the width and you can see different things. The size, the width

533
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:16,270
of it is the profit, the color is the customer segment,

534
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,558
and this is quarter by quarter. Or I could do

535
00:34:20,564 --> 00:34:24,538
it in other graphical ways, but I also can do

536
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:27,954
machine learning with Oracle analytics. It's often called

537
00:34:27,992 --> 00:34:32,066
OAC, where I just say, you know what I know,

538
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:35,702
I want a k, means I want to cluster some big data into age

539
00:34:35,756 --> 00:34:39,414
groups, separate into five groups, and do it

540
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,680
by age.

541
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:45,714
Very simple to do. So, a very intuitive

542
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:49,066
way to do that. Oracle also has AI and

543
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:52,070
machine learning built into things like manufacturing,

544
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,766
financials and things like that. Also have IoT

545
00:34:55,878 --> 00:34:59,046
connections and chat bots as well, if you're

546
00:34:59,078 --> 00:35:03,022
interested. But we're moving into this future world that

547
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:07,166
really is enabling innovation now. Why are we going so fast?

548
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:11,086
Feel like things are getting faster? It's because there are, if you

549
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:15,182
look at it, four bit was 16 bytes of addressable

550
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:18,020
memory. Eight bit was 256,

551
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,846
although they had extended, if you remember, bags around the original

552
00:35:22,878 --> 00:35:26,200
windows, 16 bit. Sixty four k.

553
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,126
Thirty two bit came out around the

554
00:35:31,148 --> 00:35:34,742
Internet. Oh, we jumped to four gig. And what

555
00:35:34,796 --> 00:35:37,240
happened? We got the Internet. It was huge.

556
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:42,246
And this is two to the fourth, two to the 8th, two to the 16th,

557
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:45,962
two to the, now two to the 64th. 18 with

558
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:49,734
18 zeros, roughly 16 exabytes

559
00:35:49,782 --> 00:35:53,326
of data, and you got to do 1024 times 1024.

560
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:57,246
That's why it comes out to 18 and 18 zeros. But think

561
00:35:57,268 --> 00:36:01,502
of the jump we're about to make with robots and AI with

562
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:05,346
64 bit coming into play. I put in miles an

563
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:08,706
hour. We went to 16 bit.

564
00:36:08,888 --> 00:36:12,206
We went from mainframe basically to a pc.

565
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:15,940
And if I call it 1 mile an hour,

566
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,326
16 to 32 is like going 65,000 miles an hour. We got

567
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:23,958
the Internet. We went to 64 bit

568
00:36:24,044 --> 00:36:27,394
just recently. It's like going 300 trillion

569
00:36:27,442 --> 00:36:31,050
mile an hour. So if you feel like things are just going so

570
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,422
fast, I can't believe it. We're getting to robotics,

571
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:38,346
AI even we're about to

572
00:36:38,368 --> 00:36:41,562
jump to 128 and then I don't know, I would say the next

573
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:45,274
three to five years, three to seven years, 5 trillion trillion billion

574
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:48,606
miles an hour, it's going to be implants and things like

575
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:52,554
that. But here come the robots. This is robots

576
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:56,494
maybe we grew up with, we saw in movies. Real robots,

577
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,610
though, are much more realistic.

578
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,402
This is a twilight zone. I like this guy. Hey, Siri, why don't my

579
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,782
relationships work out well? This is

580
00:37:07,836 --> 00:37:12,598
alexa service.

581
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:16,322
Robots are already out know. Can I seat you at your table?

582
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:20,070
Can I take you to your meeting? Can I check you in at the hotel?

583
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,642
Can I show you what's on the menu? Oracle also

584
00:37:23,696 --> 00:37:27,946
has pepper the robot connected in can

585
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:31,534
also connect in all the different things like

586
00:37:31,572 --> 00:37:34,560
Siri or SMS, WhatsApp, you name it.

587
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,654
Oracle has a virtual assistant interface that I can

588
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:42,062
use with pepper the robot as well to see what people are

589
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:45,922
asking pepper the robot if, let's say pepper the robot is

590
00:37:45,976 --> 00:37:47,940
here at a conference like it was.

591
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,494
Remember what rod emerging say the competition between man's

592
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:57,650
mind and the product of man's mind. It was about robots.

593
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,586
And it's the only time he ever said for this. They're standing

594
00:38:01,618 --> 00:38:05,062
room only in the twilight zone. Everybody is waiting to see what

595
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,998
happens. We have Amika with gestures.

596
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:11,990
Spot and atlas could dance and do somersaults.

597
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,074
Tesla bot Elon Musk says will sell more than

598
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:19,610
Tesla the car Sophia robot

599
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,590
is a citizen of Saudi Arabia.

600
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,902
Robots and automation what is the impact of jobs? Well, in some

601
00:38:27,956 --> 00:38:30,842
countries that have lower skilled jobs,

602
00:38:30,906 --> 00:38:34,514
it's a much higher impact. You can see the lower skilled jobs are

603
00:38:34,552 --> 00:38:37,826
much higher than higher skilled jobs, but all of

604
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:42,686
them will be effective. And you can see the Amazon warehouse

605
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:46,598
here. How do you make a difference? How do you lead the way?

606
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:50,134
You leverage technology. That's what Amazon does. That's what

607
00:38:50,172 --> 00:38:53,080
Oracle does. That's what Microsoft does.

608
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:57,190
Robots and automation impact the jobs are ready

609
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,034
delivery. What about the talked

610
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,502
about it earlier. Is autonomous database going to make me obsolete?

611
00:39:04,646 --> 00:39:07,980
So the twilight zone called the obsolete man we're seeing.

612
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:13,050
We used to have pinsetters and ice cutters and street lamp writers.

613
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:18,010
Do we really need that? Is it replacing

614
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,186
the DBA or DevOps? No, of course not. 11% growth

615
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:25,940
rate to 2026. Although that is the government telling you that

616
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,986
I think the DBA is going to be more important or the data engineer or

617
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:35,298
the DevOps person is going to be the most important person because they're going to

618
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:39,090
find a way to leverage that data through virtual reality

619
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,430
mixed reality. Augmented reality.

620
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,222
What if somebody has Covid and they can't get to the store?

621
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:48,514
Well, wouldn't it be nice if they could see those on the shelf?

622
00:39:48,562 --> 00:39:51,734
Or maybe if they had an iPad, they could do it there. So whether it's

623
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:55,878
virtual reality or augmented reality on an iPad,

624
00:39:56,054 --> 00:39:58,700
there's ways to leverage this in your company.

625
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,622
I find Apple a great tech innovator, I find

626
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:06,814
Amazon a great retail innovator, I find Google a

627
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:10,650
great marketing innovator, and they use Tensorflow

628
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,822
to actually do basically image recognition.

629
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:18,334
You saw the algorithm earlier, but Oracle's

630
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:22,402
focus is really making you the innovator and building the technology

631
00:40:22,536 --> 00:40:26,178
for you. Although with the acquisition of Cerner, they're going

632
00:40:26,184 --> 00:40:29,622
to be much better at medical things and

633
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:33,126
building applications where they can vet them out to make

634
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:36,534
sure they're doing well. But Oracle has machine learning in the

635
00:40:36,572 --> 00:40:40,726
autonomous database, which I've mentioned many times here, also bought

636
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:43,930
a company called Datascience.com, and they have it in

637
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,234
all their applications. They also have it in Oracle analytics, cloud or

638
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:49,500
OAC, rather.

639
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,974
If you look at machine learning, it involves a lot of things

640
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:58,234
we saw earlier, and there's also natural language processing,

641
00:40:58,282 --> 00:41:01,374
things like Chat GPT. And these start to

642
00:41:01,412 --> 00:41:05,378
give you AI, but there's all kinds of things that go with it.

643
00:41:05,544 --> 00:41:09,954
But the most important thing, I think, to remember is how

644
00:41:09,992 --> 00:41:13,970
can your business leverage it? Which piece of it can it leverage?

645
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,074
If we look at Chat GPT, I mean,

646
00:41:17,112 --> 00:41:20,406
OpenAI, I remember a guy speaking who knew

647
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:24,226
them very well, and he said, we came out of the first version of GPT,

648
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:28,290
it was GPT one, then two, then three. Nobody ever noticed.

649
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:32,474
Then when we did Chat GPT and it was four, we thought

650
00:41:32,512 --> 00:41:37,062
it wouldn't do any better than anything else, and it just took off notice.

651
00:41:37,126 --> 00:41:40,010
How long did it take to hit 100 million users?

652
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:45,358
Google Translate, 78. I mean, it's something I use all the time.

653
00:41:45,524 --> 00:41:49,134
Pinterest, 41 months. TikTok, nine months.

654
00:41:49,252 --> 00:41:52,446
Chat GPT-2 months. Is it going to

655
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,742
be big? Yes. Developed by OpenAI,

656
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:59,442
I think leveraged most by Microsoft, but every data

657
00:41:59,496 --> 00:42:03,038
company will leverage OpenAI and things like Cohere

658
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:06,726
and other AI that are out there. But basically, what is it?

659
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:11,298
It's a large language model that has used algorithms,

660
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:15,574
and you'll see a little bit more than algorithms to look at

661
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:16,390
language.

662
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,306
Here's Chat GPT. Once you sign up for

663
00:42:23,328 --> 00:42:26,922
it, it has dolly. Here's Chat GPT itself.

664
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:31,350
I said, hey, what are the top ten database databases

665
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,798
out there? Oracle is number one, but the data is

666
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:38,314
only as of September 2021, came out in November.

667
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:41,582
Notice GPT four, which passed three,

668
00:42:41,716 --> 00:42:45,506
take it back. 3.5 was the initial hit.

669
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:49,262
And then four is even better because it includes images

670
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:51,890
and words like Chat GPT.

671
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:56,674
But I actually like Google barred leveraging

672
00:42:56,722 --> 00:43:00,040
alumina leveraging Gemini even better.

673
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,406
Here's the top ten databases. And all this is slightly different, especially atp

674
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:08,860
the bottom, because Google is looking at the most up to date information.

675
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:15,210
Why did Chat GPT get so popular? And the answer was

676
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,938
a transformer paper that found a way to

677
00:43:19,024 --> 00:43:22,974
feed back in the information. As I'm building a

678
00:43:23,012 --> 00:43:26,574
story, I say

679
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:30,094
once upon a time and it starts to build the next word, it will

680
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:33,760
find the next word, then it will feed that back in

681
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,394
on the right side and

682
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:40,946
then create the next, and so on and so forth. And then it

683
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:44,370
keeps doing this over and over. But the most important thing

684
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,674
compared to recurrent neural networks, GRU lstm

685
00:43:48,802 --> 00:43:53,782
the reason it's much

686
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:56,600
more amazing,

687
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:01,622
I'll say, is because the old algorithms

688
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:05,820
we're using might be able to build you a story of 50 words.

689
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,534
This can build you a story to build you a novel that's

690
00:44:10,582 --> 00:44:14,298
five inches thick. Could use Shakespeare,

691
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:17,662
read all Shakespeare's works and then build the next

692
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:20,240
one for today. If we wanted to do that,

693
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,770
what are we searching for? Well, we're searching for

694
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,722
what's known as a foundation model. So we're doing

695
00:44:30,776 --> 00:44:34,706
all kinds of tasks. Remember the business problem we have,

696
00:44:34,888 --> 00:44:38,674
then we use some algorithm and then we find some

697
00:44:38,712 --> 00:44:41,958
important information has a result of that. Maybe I want more sales,

698
00:44:42,044 --> 00:44:45,400
maybe I want more customers. They want to find out which are the good customers.

699
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,398
But we're moving from machine learning to maybe

700
00:44:49,484 --> 00:44:52,554
deep learning, which looked at image recognition and I can even

701
00:44:52,592 --> 00:44:56,182
look at pattern recognition and things like that. But the foundation

702
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:59,786
model is all those things you want to do for your

703
00:44:59,888 --> 00:45:03,354
given company. How do I do that? And Stanford

704
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:05,520
says this will be what's next.

705
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,206
And these are the many model way of doing things. Or I could

706
00:45:10,228 --> 00:45:13,826
build one foundation model which will learn

707
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:17,620
from the different things called transfer, learning from different things.

708
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:23,054
And Oracle is now partnered with Cohere, similar to OpenAI,

709
00:45:23,182 --> 00:45:26,450
it's basically generative AI,

710
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:31,474
and they're doing it with healthcare because they bought a company called Cerner

711
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:35,042
and they're going to build a lot of applications and that's going to make Oracle's

712
00:45:35,106 --> 00:45:38,902
tools even better. Something I should

713
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:42,874
note here, though, when we're using things

714
00:45:42,912 --> 00:45:46,982
like chat, GPT and Bard and so on, is it also hallucinates.

715
00:45:47,046 --> 00:45:51,866
So what's a hallucination. A hallucination means they

716
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:55,434
came up with a fact. Since it's generative AI, it generates

717
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:58,974
something it thinks is right and it's not necessarily a fact.

718
00:45:59,012 --> 00:46:02,394
So you got to watch out for that as well. And the way you solve

719
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:06,930
that to some degree and cohere does this specifically

720
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:11,678
is you can go to your own data, which they'll keep private

721
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,900
to give a better set and give you a better answer.

722
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:18,950
The other thing Oracle came out with is the vector database

723
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:24,294
for those in DevOps or DBA. Basically, I could build

724
00:46:24,332 --> 00:46:27,926
a house hunting app and know, here's my house,

725
00:46:28,028 --> 00:46:31,594
find me one that looks just like it, and it'll tell me in a

726
00:46:31,632 --> 00:46:35,622
vector how close they are based on all the different attributes

727
00:46:35,686 --> 00:46:38,860
that are out there. It will vectorize that house.

728
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,098
How hard is it to do? Create a table or just make one a vector,

729
00:46:43,194 --> 00:46:45,680
put the photo in and then vectorize it.

730
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:50,634
Then if I want to find a house, maybe I'm in California

731
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:54,522
and I want to move to Texas. I'm just thinking of Oracle's headquarters.

732
00:46:54,586 --> 00:46:58,002
Recently. I could say I want something within

733
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:02,190
my price range, something in the city, but give me a vector

734
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,602
that's very similar to what I have now. I'm going to show you

735
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,346
the house I want and get me one just like it, but somewhere

736
00:47:09,378 --> 00:47:13,000
else in this price range. So vector search,

737
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:17,486
I showed all the different things Oracle does, JSON, relational image,

738
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:21,740
spatial, et cetera. Now they have a vector database as well.

739
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,102
Oracle's eight a stack. They have a digital

740
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:29,610
assistant. They do speech recognition, language vision,

741
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:33,594
anomaly detection, forecasting. But this generative AI

742
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:37,722
is a big one. But you want to look to build your foundation

743
00:47:37,786 --> 00:47:41,822
model for your company. What pieces are there? Not necessarily what somebody

744
00:47:41,876 --> 00:47:45,060
should tell you, but what you know are the ones.

745
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,706
I want to finish with some tech trends that

746
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:52,754
Gartner has. So notice at the beginning, it's kind of this

747
00:47:52,952 --> 00:47:56,520
mass media hype starts to continue. You have a product,

748
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:00,280
but guess what? There's no working products yet at this point.

749
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,294
And first generation products, negative press,

750
00:48:04,412 --> 00:48:07,958
maybe some failures. Finally out here,

751
00:48:08,044 --> 00:48:11,322
less than 5% adoption, and finally out here,

752
00:48:11,376 --> 00:48:14,650
30% adoption. So let's just look at

753
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,860
the world of tech over the years.

754
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:22,234
2013. What was coming, coming was prescriptive

755
00:48:22,282 --> 00:48:25,406
analytics. Well, you know, it's here now because I just showed you how to do

756
00:48:25,428 --> 00:48:29,310
it. Internet of Things was coming. Big data was coming

757
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,866
very close. Cloud computing still

758
00:48:32,888 --> 00:48:36,674
not even at 5%. Virtual reality, not at

759
00:48:36,712 --> 00:48:40,834
5%. Predictive analytics was

760
00:48:40,872 --> 00:48:44,686
finally at 30%. Prescriptive analytics was coming. And notice

761
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:48,502
the different shapes are different number of years, how long something

762
00:48:48,556 --> 00:48:52,726
will take. You could see quantum computing more

763
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:55,986
than ten years. Don't go down, though. 2015, all of a sudden,

764
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:59,718
it was all about robots coming. Human augmentation, brain computer

765
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:03,100
interface we're working on, but it's going to take a long time.

766
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:07,130
Connected home that's coming, and it's coming pretty fast.

767
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,814
In five to ten years, you know it because it's already here to some

768
00:49:10,852 --> 00:49:13,680
degree, autonomous vehicles were coming.

769
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,014
Virtual reality, finally at 5%. See how

770
00:49:18,052 --> 00:49:21,742
fast it's happening. 2016, all of a sudden, its implants are coming.

771
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:25,106
Quantum computing still is going

772
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:28,638
to take a while. You can see virtual

773
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:33,342
personal assistant, brain computer interface. They're looking at more 2018,

774
00:49:33,406 --> 00:49:36,742
all about robotics. Quantum computing, first time

775
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:39,974
ever now is coming very fast, and we're starting

776
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:43,490
to see some of them. Brain computer interface

777
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:46,786
not so far away that it used to be digital twin.

778
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,150
I want to build. I'm the DBA or DevOps,

779
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,980
and I want to build an autonomous one that does the work for me.

780
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:59,162
2020 hype. Augmented intelligence coming.

781
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:02,880
Smart robots coming, but coming very fast.

782
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:06,670
Machine learning in 2020 has not even at 5%

783
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,760
yet. Chat bots were still not even at 5%.

784
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,486
Gpus at 30%.

785
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:17,538
That was just three years ago. And then the latest one I

786
00:50:17,544 --> 00:50:20,770
have is Gen AI coming fast. Quantum machine learning.

787
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,410
Now I'm looking at. I do machine learning, but with quantum computers.

788
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,846
So the final thoughts is the world is changing fast.

789
00:50:29,948 --> 00:50:33,458
Those who use things of the world should not become too attached,

790
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:36,742
for the world is present form passing away. Boy, it seems to be passing away

791
00:50:36,796 --> 00:50:39,994
every month in a different way. Things that used to be

792
00:50:40,032 --> 00:50:44,314
popular. If I look at all the things that used to seem so

793
00:50:44,512 --> 00:50:47,510
advanced in Star Trek,

794
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,040
all of them are either here or they're coming.

795
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:57,002
Things may come to those who wait, but only things left by those who hustle.

796
00:50:57,066 --> 00:50:58,350
Are you hustling?

797
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:03,470
It used to be the mainframe that was using digital

798
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:06,814
wearing digital implanting.

799
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:09,700
Digital has already started the hide mind,

800
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,646
the Internet, leveraging it with things like chat,

801
00:51:13,678 --> 00:51:17,166
GPT already. And then I have Elon

802
00:51:17,198 --> 00:51:20,470
Musk, also with neuralink with it something that will be

803
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,754
implanted in your brain so that you can access the Internet.

804
00:51:24,802 --> 00:51:26,360
Just thinking about it,

805
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:33,802
I think a big thing is autonomous database giving you time

806
00:51:33,856 --> 00:51:37,366
enough atp last. So when I look at autonomous database,

807
00:51:37,478 --> 00:51:39,740
it does a lot of that work for you.

808
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:43,594
So first of all, you want to leverage a robot

809
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,942
for yourself, get an autonomous database. A robot may

810
00:51:47,076 --> 00:51:50,254
not look like one. Autonomous database can do that for you.

811
00:51:50,372 --> 00:51:53,554
We saw how fast we can build it. We saw how fast we get

812
00:51:53,592 --> 00:51:56,994
started, shut it down, add cpus if we

813
00:51:57,032 --> 00:52:00,706
wanted. We looked at the machine learning. We can access

814
00:52:00,808 --> 00:52:03,986
no charge with autonomous database and then

815
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:07,666
the future ahead. With robotics. We make a

816
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:10,598
living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.

817
00:52:10,684 --> 00:52:14,150
I think conf 42 gives a lot to you.

818
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,142
Education is probably the best thing out there.

819
00:52:17,276 --> 00:52:21,174
And I certainly appreciate all that they do to make that. There are some

820
00:52:21,212 --> 00:52:24,710
books I've written in the past. Those are the two most latest.

821
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,590
A few references,

822
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,120
a little bit about me. I've done a few things.

823
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:39,662
And if you want a copy of the notes, I want to thank you all

824
00:52:39,716 --> 00:52:43,534
for coming. I think anything you

825
00:52:43,572 --> 00:52:47,006
want to build is out there and ready. You just

826
00:52:47,028 --> 00:52:50,800
have to do it. Make a difference. Leverage technology.

827
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:55,622
This is your time. You got to say, why did God put you hear at

828
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:59,478
this point in time? It's got to be for a reason.

829
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:03,730
But with AI, with machine learning, with autonomous database,

830
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,302
you can make that impact. I'm looking forward to it.

831
00:53:07,356 --> 00:53:07,700
Bye now.
