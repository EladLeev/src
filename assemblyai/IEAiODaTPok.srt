1
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,090
In and I'm going to be talking about consulting for introverted developers.

2
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,646
A little bit about me. I used

3
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,654
to work in the Bay area. I went to school out there. So I worked

4
00:00:35,692 --> 00:00:39,078
at various startups and I moved to Utah. I ran the

5
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:43,266
Utah Python user group for five years, and I'm the author

6
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:47,094
of multiple Python and pandas looks. And for

7
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:50,254
my day job I do corporate training and consult team

8
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:54,394
through a company called Metasnake. The goal of Metasnake is to get people understanding Python

9
00:00:54,442 --> 00:00:58,094
well, but also get them up to speed with the Python data stack. I also

10
00:00:58,132 --> 00:01:02,126
do various consulting as well. So I'm going to talk about some

11
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:05,694
of the stuff that I've done and how I got to be where I am

12
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,026
right now. I live in Utah, as I said, and some of the things I

13
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:12,626
like, like I like skiing. In fact, I went skiing this morning

14
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:16,546
and I like hiking around, being outside. Picture on the right.

15
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:20,354
Here is a picture from southern Utah of where I live. It's fabulous

16
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:24,194
and beautiful. Some of the things I don't like, like I don't

17
00:01:24,242 --> 00:01:28,066
particularly like doing cells. I don't particularly like being in large groups.

18
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:31,434
I'd prefer to be in small groups where I can have a more one

19
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:34,874
on one talk rather than conversing in a group and trying to

20
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:37,500
talk over other people you might think,

21
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,490
know, why should I listen to Matt?

22
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,806
You might not want to listen to me. Right. Let me just give you my

23
00:01:43,828 --> 00:01:47,294
background. I think you should be wary of anyone you take advice from,

24
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:51,614
and you should know where they're coming from. So my

25
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:54,698
background, I'm a white man, I have four kids.

26
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:58,020
So I'm not someone who's working all the time.

27
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,386
I like to be around and hang out with my kids, and this

28
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:05,794
is my story. Right. And there's no guarantee that what works for me

29
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:09,926
necessarily works for you. The idea with consulting is that people are

30
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:13,094
going to pay you for your expertise. And my

31
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:16,114
goal here is not to necessarily convince you that you should be a consultant,

32
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:19,514
but just talk about my journey and maybe inspire you to think about some

33
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:22,794
things that you might want to do or might want to take

34
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:26,586
advantage of in your job as a technical persons.

35
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,434
So why is consulting nice?

36
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:33,182
Well, it pays pretty well. I have complete

37
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,320
control over my time. Like I said, I went skiing this morning.

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,302
It's a little bit harder to do that when you work for someone

39
00:02:40,356 --> 00:02:43,902
else. And I have control over what I do,

40
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:47,378
which can be a good thing and a bad thing. So why

41
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:50,450
might you not want to consider consulting?

42
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,318
Well, if you're extroverted. If you're not super thrilled

43
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:57,302
about being in front of people, then you might not want to do the sales

44
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:00,870
or marketing. Right. A lot of software or technical people

45
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,486
think that marketing is this slimy word, and you

46
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:07,414
should avoid marketing at all costs. Also,

47
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:11,178
I run a small company, and running a company has a

48
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,474
lot of things behind the scenes that you don't necessarily know about,

49
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:17,642
but that can take a lot of time as well.

50
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:21,546
And you might realize that we're now in

51
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,290
a global workplace, and you might be competing

52
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,258
for work that people in other places can do for cheaper quicker

53
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:32,526
than you. So some would call that a race to the bottom. Might be

54
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:35,130
that a traditional job is better for you.

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,626
So if you are considering going this route, sort of

56
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:42,850
the first steps that I would recommend would be to get an accountant. It's amazing

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,514
what someone who is trained in some of these things can do.

58
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:49,674
And I think it's kind of silly that you need to get an accountant.

59
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:53,462
You don't need to, but I would highly recommend that. Again,

60
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,960
I am coming from a us centric point of view,

61
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,390
this may or may not apply in other places. And in the US,

62
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,754
you'd want to form an LLC just to have some protection about

63
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:07,318
that. Again, I'm not a lawyer or an accountant. Talk to your professional

64
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,034
service provider here, and then I would list that on

65
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:14,654
LinkedIn. Why would I do that? Well, it's just nice to

66
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:18,478
have you associated with some consultancy or some company or group

67
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:22,174
that's yours instead of someone else's. And then when people are browsing your

68
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:26,240
profile, they'll see that even if you're working for a company,

69
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,306
they can see that, hey, this person might be

70
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:33,586
doing things on the side. Right? And that might turn off some people, but it

71
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,674
also sort of puts a stake in the ground and lets you say,

72
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:39,478
if you want to hire me, I've done this in the past,

73
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:42,502
and if you want to hire me full time,

74
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:46,594
right, I might do things on the side, and hopefully that's kosher

75
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:50,562
with them. If you decide to legitimately

76
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:54,026
go off and do your own thing, especially in the United States, I would

77
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:57,242
say, go find a health insurance broker. Again,

78
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:00,682
it's sort of silly, but these people can pull strings that

79
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:04,474
I can't do as an individual, take advantage of people who are professionals,

80
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:08,254
and leverage those, rather than trying to be cheap or

81
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:12,062
save time by doing things yourself. It turns out they save you both

82
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:16,206
time and money. Okay, so there's this Venn diagram of

83
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:19,566
data science by Drew Conway. It says, like, data science

84
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:22,786
is a combination of stats, programming and expertise. So I'm going to riff on that

85
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,346
a little bit, and we're going to talk about consulting. And I'm going to say

86
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:28,998
that there's kind of three things about consulting that I think are important,

87
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:32,678
and that is your attitude. And then investing, investing in yourself

88
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:35,990
and others. So the Remy meter of this talk will basically

89
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,574
go over these three things. Hopefully you can glean some insights from

90
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:42,858
it. So let's talk about attitude. First of all. First of

91
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:46,502
all, I think it's great to have what we call an abundance mentality

92
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:49,946
that there is more than enough work to go around right now. It's sort of

93
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,430
a weird time. Like, there are companies doing layoffs, but there are also companies that

94
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,586
are hiring. And before the layoffs,

95
00:05:56,618 --> 00:06:00,286
there was all of these reports of, like, there is not enough people to do

96
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:03,326
the work. And so if you are a professional and you know how to do

97
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:06,546
work, oftentimes companies are willing to outsource that.

98
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:09,874
And even during times when people are getting laid off,

99
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:13,394
oftentimes they might have small jobs that they don't want to hire someone for.

100
00:06:13,432 --> 00:06:16,894
So getting a consultant often makes sense for these companies to hire

101
00:06:16,942 --> 00:06:20,226
that work out. But if you have the attitude

102
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:23,446
that there's no work, I compete me with everyone else, that's not going to take

103
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:26,886
you very far. I firmly believe that even with the

104
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:29,798
advent of things like AI, there's a ton of work.

105
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:34,006
I have more work than I can do, and there's

106
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,420
plenty of people looking for smart people to help them do work.

107
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,962
Here's an example of attitude. I'm going to tell a little story. There was this

108
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:45,722
young man whose friend was speaking at all the conferences, and this young man wasn't.

109
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:49,166
And so I decided I want to speak at conferences. I mean, this young

110
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:52,670
man decided that. So I started working towards

111
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,494
that, right? And it was just at first

112
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:59,658
I was like, watching this person who was a friend, I'm like, oh, that's cool

113
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,778
that they get to do that. Why don't I get to do that? And it

114
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:04,850
turned out the reason why I didn't get to is because I didn't put myself

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,646
out there, right? So I have to have a mental shift to be able

116
00:07:08,668 --> 00:07:11,654
to do that. I will admit I am, like I said,

117
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:14,790
introverted. I really don't like crowds of people.

118
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,510
So in general, like, going to a conference,

119
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,286
it's kind of a waste of time for me to just go to a conference

120
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:24,860
because I'm generally not one to want to go,

121
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,366
hey, let's get a group of people and go talk. And that doesn't

122
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:33,102
really interest me. I'd rather, like I said, talk to sort of really

123
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:37,342
small groups, one or two people, three or four people, but not 20

124
00:07:37,396 --> 00:07:41,566
people, and sort of try and fight over other people to

125
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:45,870
talk. That's not really interesting to me. So attending conference

126
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,330
as just an attendee, not particularly interesting to me

127
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,106
as an introvert, however, completely different, is speaking at a

128
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:57,222
conference, right. When you speak at a conference, you're sort of flipping the roles there,

129
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,902
and you're dispensing wisdom, sharing with others,

130
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:04,902
but also you're basically inviting others to come to you and talk

131
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:08,886
with you. A power tip that I would give you is that if you are

132
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:11,914
introverted and you're like, I need to go network with people,

133
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:15,126
well, flip it. Be the one who's dispersing the wisdom,

134
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:18,774
and then people will come to you. On that note of attitude,

135
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:20,990
right. Generally,

136
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,318
I have to feed my family, so I do things from,

137
00:08:26,404 --> 00:08:29,674
you could say, a purely

138
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,920
monetary point of view, right.

139
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,854
I don't go to conferences generally just for fun.

140
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:39,746
I go there because I have a goal, right, which is to feed my

141
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:43,266
family. Right. And generally, when I'm speaking, I expect

142
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:46,534
to get business from the talk. I might not get paid for this talk,

143
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:50,134
but my general feeling and my

144
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:53,734
experience, and again, this is anecdota, this is just my experience,

145
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:57,414
is that most of my work comes from my

146
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,700
network and from interactions with others,

147
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,794
and most of that is from conferences. So that's a big

148
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:08,266
source of work for me. Like I said, I get pitched all

149
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:11,778
the time, places like LinkedIn or Twitter,

150
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:15,642
but most of my work has come from my network

151
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:19,662
or being at a conference and talking at a conference, and that brings people

152
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:23,486
to want to work with me. Another thing

153
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:26,282
that's a great idea, is just to have goals,

154
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:30,034
right? My goal was to speak at a conference, and so you can say,

155
00:09:30,072 --> 00:09:33,442
I want to speak at a conference, but if you never do anything towards that,

156
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:37,282
then you really don't want to. It's just sort of a wish. So I would

157
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:40,406
say write down your goals and work towards them.

158
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:43,682
Maybe find a mentor, someone who can help you and make progress

159
00:09:43,746 --> 00:09:47,960
towards that. But I'm a big fan of goal setting and

160
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,850
putting forth action towards what you want to achieve.

161
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,180
Let's talk about investing in yourself.

162
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,834
I'm going to tell you a story about someone who wanted to create

163
00:09:59,872 --> 00:10:03,966
the first Python series for a company called Pluralsight, which does

164
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:08,334
on demand video. This person was

165
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:12,222
asked to create the first Python course, and at the time, pluralsight was a net

166
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:15,934
company. And so this person made an introductory

167
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,734
Python course or a demo course on Linux.

168
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:22,354
And pluralsight told me, I mean this person that

169
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:25,586
they don't want the course because it's on Linux, they want it

170
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:29,366
recorded on windows at the time. And I was like

171
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:33,366
hey, I'm a hardcore Linux user and I've been running Linux for

172
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:37,046
ten years. I'm not really interested in recording it on Windows or

173
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:40,602
whatever. Long story short, this person did not get that

174
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:44,486
video. But I've been heard that that video has generated

175
00:10:44,598 --> 00:10:48,134
on the order of a million plus dollars in revenue

176
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:51,582
for the person who did Create that video,

177
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:54,458
right? So bad choice.

178
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:57,994
Person who chose not to get a windows

179
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:01,886
laptop, right? And my story is that

180
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:05,070
you should invest in the correct tooling,

181
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,994
right? At that point in time I was like they

182
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:12,386
should just use what I want to use. And turns out that a lot of

183
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,874
times the business world doesn't work like that. They want to

184
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:19,474
use what they want to use. And if you want to play in their ballpark,

185
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:23,026
you need to play by their rules, right? That small investment

186
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,106
in getting a laptop and maybe that small investment wouldn't

187
00:11:27,138 --> 00:11:30,506
have made it so I would have got the video, but I imagine it would

188
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:33,546
have, could have been a lot of money, right? Tell you

189
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,286
another story about a person who gave a tutorial

190
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:41,014
and then wanted or was invited

191
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:44,334
by a conference to give this tutorial again at another conference. And so

192
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:48,702
this person started writing a looks from the tutorial rather

193
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:52,094
than just rewriting the slides. And so this book took

194
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:54,974
me a little bit longer than I wanted to. I mean this person took this

195
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:58,722
person a little bit longer than they wanted to, but eventually they wrote the book.

196
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:02,770
Writing a book is a great way to attract interest,

197
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,794
right? It is an investment in yourself. A lot of people will say don't write

198
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:09,734
a book for the money. Some books are more or less,

199
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:13,618
they sell more or less, right? Most technical books don't

200
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:17,142
sell lots. Some can. This is like a business card,

201
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,338
right? When you have written a book on something, it's sort of like saying I'm

202
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:23,110
an expert in this and you're sort of putting a stake in the ground.

203
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,506
And so if you want business around some topic, especially if

204
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:29,594
it's a niche topic, putting a book out there is a great

205
00:12:29,632 --> 00:12:33,162
way to attract business for consulting. And these days self

206
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:36,640
publishing is super easy. It is not hard to

207
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,854
write a book. I mean it is hard work to write a book,

208
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,530
but I could take a word document and upload it into Amazon

209
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,666
and have a book published in like 48

210
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:50,398
hours. So the process of getting that book published self published

211
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:53,458
is not particularly hard. I'm not going to get into the pros and cons of

212
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:57,554
self publishing versus not, but I will say that publishers want content.

213
00:12:57,672 --> 00:13:01,090
And I have heard stories of people who

214
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,454
self published a book and then well before

215
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,334
they self published it, they approached a publisher. The publisher is like, no, I don't.

216
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:11,030
Not interested. You're an unknown and we don't want you. After they

217
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,146
self publish their looks on Amazon, you can see their rankings and

218
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:18,358
these publishers can look at their rankings and they can know how many books they'll

219
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:21,834
sell based on the rankings. Right. And it's pretty easy for them

220
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:24,606
just to look at the rankings and figure out whether or not they want to

221
00:13:24,628 --> 00:13:28,366
basically take that book in and do a rerelease of it

222
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:31,438
as a published book. And that is possible as well.

223
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:34,960
So these are investments that you can make in yourself.

224
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,154
Certainly writing a book should take time, or will take time.

225
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,434
My experience is that it's not something that you do in 48

226
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:45,758
hours. It takes a bit of time, but it can pay dividends.

227
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:49,686
Not just monetary dividends, but bring you work that pays you

228
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:52,200
more than writing the book itself would pay.

229
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,226
Another thing that you can do to invest in yourself is to become a leader.

230
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:59,634
Again. This is something that a lot of people who are technical people aren't

231
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:02,798
particularly interested in doing or don't

232
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,818
think that they can do. And I'm here to tell you, even if you're an

233
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:09,066
introvert, you can be a leader. And these are skills that you can

234
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:12,346
learn. Right? So I've got a little drawing here, what I call

235
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,454
the onion skin of open source participation. And so

236
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:19,194
like I said, I used Linux for a long time on my laptop.

237
00:14:19,322 --> 00:14:22,862
I've been involved in the open source community and the

238
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,938
people who hold the most power are the most central, right? And so you

239
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:30,386
could think of this like an onion that has layers. At the middle is the

240
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:33,858
committer. This is the person who's writing the code, who knows the code.

241
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,690
And people have to do what the committer says basically.

242
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,958
Right. Then you have people around that maybe you submit a pr

243
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:43,746
pull request so someone will change something. So you're pretty involved,

244
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:47,414
but you're not a committer. Right. But that might lead to getting

245
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:51,346
commit rights if you do that multiple times. And then you'll hear of people

246
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:54,314
who will just file bugs and use the mailing list,

247
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:58,310
which is not quite as involved as writing a pull request.

248
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,986
Then there are people who will use the library, and then there are people who

249
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:04,574
have heard the library so we're going outside here as we go out.

250
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,138
These people have less leadership or less responsibility.

251
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:11,902
Right. If you want to be known for a

252
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:15,234
project and you want to consult on a project, great thing

253
00:15:15,272 --> 00:15:18,898
to do would be to start pushing yourself

254
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,594
into that project so you can start participating in

255
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:26,230
that and leverage that for consulting.

256
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,998
So I'm going to tell another story about a person who wanted to be a

257
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,626
core Python committer. This is a colleague, so it's

258
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:38,470
not me. And this person was like,

259
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,858
I want to be a core Python committer. Right. And they didn't just

260
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:46,570
say they wanted to do that. They started following the mailing list,

261
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,378
they started submitting pull requests, and eventually they became a

262
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:54,426
core Python committer, which led to a bunch of jobs and opportunities

263
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:58,174
that I would dare say that they wouldn't have gotten had they not done

264
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,406
that. And I watched this firsthand. This person worked with

265
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,346
me, set a few cubicles down for

266
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:08,510
me. So what can you do to become a leader?

267
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,534
Well, you can speak, right? So go to a meetup.

268
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:14,542
You can share with other looks.

269
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,002
Right. And sharing can be in various ways. Right. It can be in book form,

270
00:16:18,056 --> 00:16:22,022
it can be in podcasts, it can be on a blog, it can be through

271
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:25,766
social media. All of these things of putting yourself out

272
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:29,350
there can be hard and difficult, but if you're interested in something,

273
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,162
it shouldn't be particularly hard to start talking about that.

274
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:36,442
Right. The challenge for a lot of people is like, looking someone

275
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:40,054
in the eyes to do that. But again, this is something

276
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:44,490
with practice that you can learn to do. There's a blog

277
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,166
post by a fellow named David Robinson who

278
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:53,134
said something pretty similar. The effectiveness of public work, doing work in

279
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:56,322
public. Right. You're going to do a bunch of work anyway. If you

280
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:59,010
sort of share that on social media or whatnot,

281
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,834
people start to know you for that. And so you can blog about

282
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:06,254
something, you can tweet, you can contribute to open source, you can give talks,

283
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:10,200
you can record screencasts, you can write a book. This is in their order of

284
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,550
easiest to best, or the things at the bottom

285
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,214
are the most effective. I don't necessarily think that writing the book is

286
00:17:18,252 --> 00:17:21,658
necessarily the most effective. I know that people who have gotten a

287
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:25,900
lot of business just from tweeting, so there are various forms of

288
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,906
putting yourself out in the public and getting attention that

289
00:17:30,928 --> 00:17:34,846
way. Another thing that you should do when you're investing in yourself

290
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:37,870
is take care of your body. So I have,

291
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,534
like, my keyboard. This is my current keyboard, or part of it.

292
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:44,826
When I was writing my first book, my fingers started hurting, and I'm

293
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:48,366
like, I need to take care of my fingers because I use a keyboard

294
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:51,998
for a living, right? And so I messed around with keyboards

295
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:54,978
and found a keyboard that works for me. Not saying that you have to get

296
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:57,782
a keyboard like me, but you should listen to your body,

297
00:17:57,836 --> 00:18:02,082
right? And you should do things like get enough sleep generally,

298
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:05,366
like, trying to hack through the night is not an effective way of

299
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:09,286
coding or working and exercise. Right. Doing things that

300
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,130
take care of yourself because there's only one of you. Okay.

301
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,202
The next thing is to invest in others. What do I mean by that?

302
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:20,202
Well, again, this is that abundance mentality. There's more than enough work to go around.

303
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:24,698
I can share that work, and I can share and help others. On that note,

304
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:27,950
like I said, I've been involved in the Python community for a long time,

305
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,994
and I know a lot of python

306
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:36,078
authors. I also know a lot of python consultants and a lot of python trainers.

307
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:39,586
So these are people who I see at conferences or I

308
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:42,850
chat with on social media, or even email with.

309
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,734
And I could look at them as competition, but they're not my competition.

310
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:50,246
There's more than enough work to go around, and I would prefer to

311
00:18:50,268 --> 00:18:53,394
not view them as competition, rather as partners.

312
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:57,586
Hopefully, if I help them, they will help me and we'll

313
00:18:57,618 --> 00:18:59,320
share the abundance together.

314
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,378
Another thing that you can do to help others is instead of

315
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:07,420
thinking immediately, I'm going to pitch you on my services,

316
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,002
ask them, what can I do for you? Without necessarily

317
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,794
expecting payment? And that can open some doors,

318
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:17,950
right. If you're showing that you're willing to help others,

319
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,360
that is a way for it to build trust.

320
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,540
And when you have trust, people want to work with you.

321
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,234
Another way you can invest in others is to have

322
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:34,820
what's called a mastermind group. So this is basically

323
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,440
getting a small group of people who are doing similar things

324
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,898
that you are doing, and then just chatting

325
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:47,330
with them, talking about what they're doing, their problems, and brainstorming.

326
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,834
So, like, I've done this in the past with folks

327
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:54,266
doing similar things. To me, it can be super useful. You can get ideas from

328
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:58,010
them, but you can also get, like, don't do this, this hurt me.

329
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,746
Or, hey, go look at this. This might help you.

330
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:04,174
Oftentimes we're very heads down in what we're focused on,

331
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:08,062
but other people who are doing similar things might be focused on something else that

332
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:10,000
we might not be aware of.

333
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,182
Another thing is investing in others. You can view clients as

334
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:18,306
others and investing in clients. Right. I want to work with

335
00:20:18,328 --> 00:20:22,066
clients that are good to me. And presumably clients want to work

336
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:25,554
with me when I'm good to them, right? So how can you do that?

337
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,774
I mean, one thing is giving them a fair price. You should be

338
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:32,406
willing to drop clients if they don't want to invest in you,

339
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:35,654
right? If they're not returning the favor, drop them.

340
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:39,014
So be fair to clients, but also don't let them take advantage of

341
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:42,154
you. Again, how can you invest in

342
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:45,862
others? And this goes back to that. Put yourself out there teaching,

343
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:50,010
investing in yourself, but sharing that with others is investing with others.

344
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,678
And if you want to bring attention to you,

345
00:20:53,764 --> 00:20:57,038
social media is a great way to do that. And I've seen this happen

346
00:20:57,124 --> 00:21:00,042
on multiple platforms, right? Twitter, LinkedIn,

347
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:03,090
YouTube. By sharing content,

348
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,282
people start to pay attention and

349
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:10,978
know that they can get the content from you. What are

350
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:14,898
some other ways to invest in others? Just be charitable with yourself.

351
00:21:14,984 --> 00:21:18,374
Like donate, invest in others.

352
00:21:18,492 --> 00:21:21,874
So I like to teach, and I teach at schools,

353
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:25,266
right? So I've taught classes for third to 6th graders,

354
00:21:25,298 --> 00:21:28,226
teaching them how to program python, do data science,

355
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:31,734
create ebooks, program drones,

356
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:35,722
that sort of thing. I think it's just good to have a good attitude and

357
00:21:35,776 --> 00:21:39,786
to not look, know everyone's sort of taking away from me,

358
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:43,166
but I'm contributing to society as a whole.

359
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:46,606
There's a great book called the Coder's path to wealth and

360
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:49,546
independence. The title might be a little woo woo,

361
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:53,226
but Mark Beckner wrote this book and I've

362
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:56,362
had it for a long time and it sort of kicked me off

363
00:21:56,436 --> 00:22:00,206
down this path and has a lot of good advice. So if you're considering

364
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:03,474
going down like this, consulting rabbit hole, this book,

365
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:07,034
it's a little old now, but it has a lot of good pieces

366
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:10,886
of advice for starting off that path, especially if you're in

367
00:22:10,908 --> 00:22:14,662
the US. Okay, so in summary, three things

368
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:18,266
I think are important is just your overall attitude. Look on the positive side

369
00:22:18,288 --> 00:22:22,234
of things and then be willing to invest. Be willing to spend money and

370
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:24,860
time in both yourself and others.

371
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,306
Typically, an investment has some risk, right?

372
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:32,138
And the investment might not get value,

373
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:35,886
but generally we are investing because we believe something will

374
00:22:35,908 --> 00:22:39,118
grow and return us back more than we put into it.

375
00:22:39,204 --> 00:22:42,238
The things that I've listed here I've seen have helped me.

376
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:46,254
Again, this is anecdotal, but they've helped me in my career and

377
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:50,186
allowed me to do what I do. Thanks everyone for listening.

378
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:53,454
I hope you found something of this useful. Even if you're not considering going

379
00:22:53,492 --> 00:22:56,902
out and becoming a consultant, if you want to reach out to me,

380
00:22:57,036 --> 00:23:00,342
feel free to connect on Twitter Dunder M. Harrison. I'm also

381
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:03,954
on LinkedIn as well. If you're interested in training or consulting,

382
00:23:04,002 --> 00:23:07,026
reach out to me and we can talk about Metasnake.

383
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,830
Okay. Have a great conference. Thanks, everyone.
