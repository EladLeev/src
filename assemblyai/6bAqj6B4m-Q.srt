1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,314
You humans make mistakes,

2
00:00:29,442 --> 00:00:33,250
and at some point in time, errors in judgment will occur

3
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,430
despite everybody's best sections and domain expertise.

4
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,974
Failure and what you do with it can have a

5
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:44,710
transformational effect on your organization.

6
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,726
So what do you do when things go wrong?

7
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:52,554
Do you blame people up, ignore indicators of underlying

8
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:56,494
problems, and continue business as usual until the next

9
00:00:56,532 --> 00:01:00,810
crisis occurs? Or do you encourage feedback

10
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,250
and try find ways to transform failures into learning opportunities?

11
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,554
I'll cover some of these fantastic topics and a little

12
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:13,326
bit more in this talk on blameless postmortem culture.

13
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:17,954
So very quickly, what this talk is not let's

14
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:21,110
understand that this is not a lecture on SRE.

15
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,786
This is not a lecture on outages and how to resolve

16
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,506
them. And I will not be teaching you how to

17
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:30,940
write a postmortem step by step.

18
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,446
However, what this talk is, is I'll

19
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,182
go deeper into some of these following topics.

20
00:01:38,326 --> 00:01:42,154
So what's a good postmortem? Why is it important to write them?

21
00:01:42,272 --> 00:01:45,520
And then why isn't writing a good postmortem not easy?

22
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,154
I'll also go over how well written postmortem culture be an effective

23
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:54,110
tool to influence culture around you. And then towards

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,874
the end, I'll cover some possibilities around what you can

25
00:01:57,912 --> 00:02:01,166
do after you've written a bunch of good postmortems.

26
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:05,090
So here's a little bit about myself. I am currently a program

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,306
manager at Google within site reliability engineering,

28
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:11,574
or SRE as we know it. I've been at Google for

29
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:14,946
about four and a half years and I've worked on multiple teams.

30
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:18,526
So mobile client infrastructure, currently firebase SRE.

31
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:22,294
And then I also had some opportunity to work with Gmail,

32
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,490
spam abuse and delivery SRE.

33
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,174
I have co authored a chapter on blameless postmortem culture

34
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:33,290
in the second Cytre Liability engineering book, which is called the Cytre Liability

35
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,566
Workbook. And then I also co authored a report which

36
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:41,050
is titled Engineering Reliable Mobile Applications.

37
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,866
Both of these are available on the SRE site for free.

38
00:02:45,048 --> 00:02:49,230
And in my previous experience, I juggled

39
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,340
multiple roles at a company called Bright Idea.

40
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,814
By education, I'm can electrical engineer, and then I've

41
00:02:56,862 --> 00:03:00,738
also done a little bit of Bollywood dance instructor, and I was a primary

42
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:05,030
dancer for them. And I love traveling and I love food.

43
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,878
2021 looks very optimistic with respect to vaccines

44
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:12,938
and hopefully some sort of normalcy. So I just cannot wait

45
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,214
to board my next flight and go to a new destination

46
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,974
soon. All right, so that's enough context about

47
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:24,266
me in terms of philosophy.

48
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,062
Let's bring everybody on the same page and talk a little bit

49
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:31,754
about general philosophy behind postmortem

50
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:35,054
culture. Now, whenever an incident occurs,

51
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:39,294
the person who's on call, these first priority is to mitigate

52
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:42,466
the incident, fix the underlying issue,

53
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:46,434
and then ensure that services return back to their normal

54
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:50,098
operating conditions. The next big responsibility

55
00:03:50,194 --> 00:03:53,590
is to make sure that the system doesn't break

56
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,126
in the same way again. Now, unless we

57
00:03:57,148 --> 00:04:00,890
have some sort of a formalized process of learning

58
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,330
from these incidents in place, these may reoccur.

59
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,226
Left unchecked, incidents can multiply in complexity or they can sometimes

60
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:13,482
cascade. This can overwhelm a system and ultimately

61
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:17,562
impact our users. Now one of the reasons

62
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:21,022
I decided to share this talk with you today is because

63
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:25,054
I want to dispel the myth that postmortem culture is only applicable

64
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:28,420
to big organizations or deep technical problems.

65
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,430
I think as long as one understands the basic framework,

66
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,642
they can use it to address a variety of failures for personal growth,

67
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:40,178
growth of others, encouraging accountability, sharing knowledge

68
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:43,654
and best practices, and documents facts for the long

69
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:47,554
term so others can learn from it. I know I've

70
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,746
personally used the framework to think through a variety of

71
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,450
tough situations in my personal life. Also,

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,386
when things didn't go according to plan. It can also

73
00:04:57,408 --> 00:05:00,426
be a very effective tool for leadership to be transparent

74
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,994
about popular decisions and document some rationale

75
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:06,110
behind their unpopular choices.

76
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,894
In almost all the cases I've seen, people really appreciate when

77
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:13,810
leaders lead by example and are transparent.

78
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,238
Now, introducing such a culture can seem intimidating

79
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:22,434
at first, but making this change incrementally is possible,

80
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:26,054
and one can gradually tune the process based on their

81
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,590
organization's needs. One of the best

82
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,094
ways to make use of this talk today is

83
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,534
to think of a recent high impact failure that you

84
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:39,754
experienced and think about how that situation was

85
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:43,958
handled. Then apply the principles and best practices

86
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:47,786
of blameless postmortem culture to that situation and

87
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:51,390
these imagine if things could have been done a little bit differently.

88
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,102
So what is things postmortem I keep talking about?

89
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:59,562
This is especially for newer folks. So a postmortem

90
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:03,630
is a written record of an incident, its impact

91
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,778
actions taken to mitigate or resolve it, the root cause,

92
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:11,454
and then very importantly, the follow up actions

93
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:15,006
to prevent the incident from reoccurring. Now,

94
00:06:15,048 --> 00:06:19,062
let's talk through a simple, high level template. The first

95
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:22,230
section is all about quick executive summary.

96
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,374
This can include sections like incident details which

97
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:30,374
could be simple facts such as incident date, postmortem writing

98
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:34,570
date, when it was published, and then who has access to the document.

99
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,266
Another subset of these exec updates could be

100
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:42,182
about the problem summary duration of these problem estimated

101
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:46,750
user impact detection mechanisms and resolution after

102
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,190
exec updates. These next section is background.

103
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,774
This is specifically meant for people who don't have a lot

104
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:57,074
of context around your postmortem culture.

105
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:00,610
Could be new employees or people who've just recently joined your team,

106
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,700
or people from a completely different part of the company,

107
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,426
or people who think your postmortem in

108
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:10,520
a way could be related to an outage they are dealing with currently.

109
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,254
This section is also important because one of the best practices is

110
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:19,418
that once a postmortem is written, ideally everybody

111
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:23,146
should be able to read it throughout the company. Next we go

112
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:26,602
into sections where concrete details are expected so

113
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:30,406
impact of the outage, root cause trigger and these recovery

114
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:34,570
efforts. After that, let's do some deliberate introspection

115
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,334
and we document lessons learned so things that went well,

116
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:41,902
things that did not go well and then my personal favorite is

117
00:07:41,956 --> 00:07:45,650
where did we get lucky? And things unfortunately happens

118
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,554
more than one would like. Next, we document action items and then what

119
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:53,250
we want to get out of it. One important problem

120
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,706
with action items is usually they're not very measurable.

121
00:07:56,898 --> 00:08:00,310
It's important that they are objectively measurable.

122
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,066
They have owners priority and some sort of a tracking

123
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:07,942
id. And then these last sections is glossary again

124
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:12,126
meant for people who don't have a lot of context about your postmodern

125
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,418
with respect, two terminology that you're using and may need a

126
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:19,110
quick reference in addition to the basic template.

127
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,960
Usually it's encouraged that you

128
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,262
over communicate in terms of making the other person

129
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:31,422
understand what your postmortem is all about. All of these sections need

130
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:35,106
careful attention and there are best practices around how to

131
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:38,546
handle each one of them. So now you may

132
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:42,434
be wondering that things sounds like

133
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:46,034
too much work and so do we need to write a postmortem

134
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:49,910
for every single failure? Well, the answer is no, we don't.

135
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,246
Teams need to define postmortem criteria before an

136
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:57,946
incident occurs so that everyone knows when a postmortem is

137
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:02,070
necessary. In addition to these objective triggers,

138
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,754
1 may also request a postmortem from another team if they

139
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,386
think it's warranted. Personally speaking, over the

140
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:12,846
years, postmortem culture become such an innate part of the

141
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:16,798
SRE culture that we organically know when we can expect

142
00:09:16,884 --> 00:09:20,334
one. Another idea could be to group

143
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:23,954
small incidents that have a similar in nature into

144
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:28,446
one postmortem for resolution rather than writing one little postmortem

145
00:09:28,478 --> 00:09:32,046
for each incident. Writing postmortem should ideally

146
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,874
be looked at as a learning opportunity for the entire company and

147
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:39,426
not as a punishment. It's definitely worth acknowledging

148
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:43,106
that a good postmortem process does present an inherent

149
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:46,694
cost in terms of time and or effort, so one

150
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:49,660
needs to be deliberate in choosing when to write one.

151
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,034
So the next question is, when do you write one?

152
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:56,090
Well, depends on your needs and circumstances.

153
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,540
One criteria fits all approach doesn't really work here.

154
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,794
For example, a team whose primary responsibility is ensuring

155
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:08,442
the reliability of a website's ecommerce infrastructure

156
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:12,126
will have distinctly different success

157
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:15,726
criteria or failure metrics than a team whose

158
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:19,106
primary responsibility is product development. The two

159
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:22,046
teams will also have a distinct set of personalities,

160
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:25,720
making incident management nuances somewhat different.

161
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,830
So some example scenarios could include maybe

162
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,830
business reasons where x numbers of users are affected,

163
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,814
y amount of money is lost in revenue, or there

164
00:10:37,852 --> 00:10:40,902
could be loss in user trust due to a marketing error,

165
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:44,598
or some other reasons. There could be product reasons

166
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,434
for writing a postmortem. For example,

167
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:51,054
a latest canary shows significant regression in

168
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:54,650
a metric. A risky change was pushed out two production

169
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,370
during production freeze. Or there could be people reasons.

170
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,326
So let's say a disruptive reorg impacted people's

171
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:06,654
careers. An improper project management

172
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,820
overloaded people for a long time.

173
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,294
What matters are that these criteria are defined

174
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,370
in the first place and periodically revisited,

175
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,974
so one knows when to escalate an incident and when

176
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,734
it becomes an all hands on deck situation. One can also

177
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:27,638
write a postmortem for personal reasons, for example, that travel

178
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:31,450
plan went completely awry or I'm feeling burnt out,

179
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,386
et cetera, in terms of defining a criteria for

180
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:38,938
your personal growth. Also, a solid understanding of your

181
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:42,526
own self will guide you, and then you'll know when to write a

182
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:46,654
postmortem. So, so far we've talked in detail about

183
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,606
what we should do. It sounds pretty straightforward. Have some

184
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:54,134
predefined postmortem writing criteria. If an incident

185
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:57,870
occurs, fill out a template, create a return record of an incident,

186
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,794
create some action items, and then magically all our problems are

187
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:05,814
solved. But is it really that simple to

188
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:09,830
answer the question? The next thing I want to emphasize

189
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,230
on is the importance of ensuring psychological safety.

190
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,502
Now, writing a postmortem just for the sake of writing a document

191
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:22,326
is not enough. In fact, if not written

192
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:25,770
well, it can be counterproductive to your culture.

193
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,314
It could lead to an atmosphere where incidents or issues are swept

194
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:33,840
under the rug, leading to a greater risk for your company.

195
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,222
So to make the best of postmortem culture, it's absolutely

196
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:41,310
imperative to keep them blameless.

197
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,522
So a blamelessly written postmortem assumes that

198
00:12:45,576 --> 00:12:49,022
everyone involved in an incident had good intentions

199
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,020
and did the right thing with these information they had,

200
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,854
it focuses on what went wrong instead of who

201
00:12:56,972 --> 00:13:00,486
did wrong. This is important

202
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:04,370
because basic human nature makes accepting failure

203
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,234
very difficult. Sometimes these mistakes can cost your

204
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:11,894
company millions of dollars or euros. And accepting

205
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:15,306
that something that did caused it can be

206
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,434
very embarrassing and distressing. For individuals in

207
00:13:19,472 --> 00:13:22,714
a very toxic organization, publicly acknowledging

208
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:25,710
mistakes can sometimes cost people their careers.

209
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,314
Now, all of these fears will make it pretty much impossible

210
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,954
for a postmortem to be valuable, fact based

211
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:38,286
and objective. Now, the best practice to combat

212
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,486
this fear is to keep your postmortems blameless.

213
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:44,986
But why? Now we has humans fear

214
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:48,194
public humiliation. Speaking up under normal

215
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:51,622
circumstances is hard enough. Speaking up under

216
00:13:51,676 --> 00:13:55,234
immense pressure, as in when an ongoing incident

217
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:58,650
is happening, is much harder, and people

218
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,518
generally tend to avoid the spotlight for the fear of being ridiculed.

219
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:06,762
Now, ironically, a crisis demands for someone to step

220
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:10,942
up, think differently, and also speak. Also remember

221
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:14,282
that perform postmortems are artifacts.

222
00:14:14,426 --> 00:14:17,360
So now we've increased the complexity of the problem.

223
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,790
Not only does one have to risk isolating themselves in difficult

224
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,780
circumstances, they also fear being documented in history.

225
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,938
So what if I make a mistake? Everyone will know.

226
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:33,602
Will I be fired? Will I not get promoted? Will my future

227
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,834
employees make fun of me? These are all very valid

228
00:14:36,882 --> 00:14:40,086
concerns. And then there's the

229
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:42,870
potential to curb innovation and autonomy.

230
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,078
Now dreaming big working on revolutionary ideas brings

231
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:51,802
a certain amount of associated risk, which may very well result

232
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:55,622
in failures. If a person doesn't feel psychologically

233
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,082
safe in taking calculated risks, they may never

234
00:14:59,136 --> 00:15:02,990
act on those ideas and then innovation will probably stagnate.

235
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,854
This also takes away from that person's autonomy has

236
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:11,870
they'll tend to just follow instructions from their sections or someone else

237
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,582
instead of being creative themselves. We cannot

238
00:15:15,646 --> 00:15:19,666
create future visionaries and leaders like things. Now it

239
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:22,914
may seem like a good idea to highlight individuals while

240
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:25,490
describing an outage in a postmortem.

241
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,394
Instinctively, it feels like we are assigning ownership

242
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:33,286
to someone, which may then motivate the individual

243
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:36,662
to take responsibility. But the big

244
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:40,686
risk in doing so is individuals would become risk covers

245
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:43,130
because they may fear public humiliation.

246
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,622
This can lead to people covering up facts. Risking transparency,

247
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:51,022
which could be critical to understanding, can issue and

248
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:54,334
preventing it from reoccurring. And when it comes to

249
00:15:54,372 --> 00:15:57,726
personal circumstances, blaming yourself for, let's say

250
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,480
a personal outage is not great either.

251
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,862
Have faith in yourself, assume best intent,

252
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,466
and know that you acted in the best of your abilities, in the

253
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:11,700
circumstances and the context around you.

254
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,598
Blameful behavior can be pretty detrimental from a

255
00:16:16,604 --> 00:16:20,914
people perspective, but blameful

256
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:25,158
behavior can be very problematic from business

257
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:28,426
perspective. Also, when mistakes are

258
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:31,978
hidden, systematic fixes are harder and problems

259
00:16:32,064 --> 00:16:35,782
are more likely to reoccur. Also, blaming humans

260
00:16:35,846 --> 00:16:39,686
sometimes tends to result in fire human as an action

261
00:16:39,718 --> 00:16:42,986
item. Now for a moment, even if we ignore

262
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:46,414
that that may not be the right thing to do. It still

263
00:16:46,452 --> 00:16:50,046
doesn't prevent reoccurrence of a problem. If the

264
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:53,906
system has set up to allow these human to make the mistake in the

265
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:57,534
first place, there's a higher probability that a newly

266
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:01,362
hired and less experienced human will

267
00:17:01,496 --> 00:17:05,206
repeat that outage. So blameful behavior is pretty

268
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:08,520
detrimental from a business perspective also.

269
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,534
All right, so we all get the idea of

270
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:16,134
blamelessness. Let's work on an example together and

271
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:19,610
see how we can transform accusations into simple

272
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,430
facts. So, in terms of this exercise,

273
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,570
remember to focus on what went wrong

274
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,766
instead of who did wrong. So let's

275
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,374
say there's a hypothetical incident, and then

276
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:37,470
there's a hypothetical postmortem that was written, and this

277
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,246
was noted as the root cause. So this says,

278
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:45,454
dylan, one did not both to set up alerting for our storage

279
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:49,490
cluster or check our hard drives manually in case of doubt.

280
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,134
Of course, we ran out of space and then this disaster

281
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:57,346
ensued. Now, maybe pause

282
00:17:57,378 --> 00:18:01,350
this video, take a couple of minutes, and then think

283
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,510
if there's anything wrong with the way this is written in the postmortem.

284
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,602
All right, I hope you've thought about it a little bit so

285
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,010
I can give my perspective here. So not only is this example

286
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,246
very blameful, where clearly one person is being scapegoated,

287
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:22,570
it's also quite dramatic. So phrases such as disaster

288
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,558
or of course, that happened add absolutely no value

289
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:30,394
to your document. What it does is erode psychological

290
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,986
safety and make your culture toxic. You can

291
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:37,602
be sure that, Dylan, one is not going to speak up when

292
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:41,374
another outage happens, and the company could probably lose

293
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:43,540
or out on some valuable information.

294
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,174
A better way to express the gravity of the situation would

295
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:52,514
be to gather facts and document them objectively

296
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:56,200
with metrics. So here's an example

297
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,890
of a more objective, blameless version.

298
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,986
So the hard drives in one of the trading storage clusters run out

299
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:09,450
of space, and this was not noticed due to a lack of alerting.

300
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,042
This led to trades from that cluster being redirected to other trading clusters,

301
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,994
which were also almost full. And an action

302
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:21,710
item that could come out of this is to set up alerting for this scenario,

303
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,326
and that AI must have an owner and some sort of a tracking

304
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:28,754
id. Let's move on to

305
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:32,254
leadership. Now, I'm assuming we're all leaders

306
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:35,506
here, so let's take a look at some

307
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:39,014
of the ideas we can propose and implement to

308
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,630
foster a blameless postmortem culture in our surroundings.

309
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,870
Now, one of the best things all of us can do is lead by examples

310
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,100
you has. Leaders can start writing a few postmortems yourself.

311
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,810
This will give you an opportunity to experiment with

312
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,290
what format or template works best for your.

313
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,594
This is also an opportunity to set the tone of the postmortem

314
00:20:03,642 --> 00:20:07,066
culture you'd like to see. Once you've

315
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:10,846
written with an artifact, share it openly, let the

316
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:14,434
readers digest the content of your documents, and then come back

317
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:18,290
to you with questions and feedback. This is another opportunity

318
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,170
to experiment with your postmortem format.

319
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,326
Now once people warm up to the concept and see you doing

320
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:29,240
the right thing, they'll probably be encouraged to do some themselves.

321
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,698
Now, once folks have accumulated a few postmortems

322
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:37,410
over time, you can use this wealth of knowledge as training

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,938
material for future leaders. One example

324
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:44,438
is an exercise called the wheel of misfortune.

325
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:48,710
Think of it as disaster roleplay in which a previous

326
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,554
postmortem is reenacted with a cast of employees.

327
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:55,950
Playing does as laid out in the postmortem.

328
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,414
The aim is to make the experience has real as possible and

329
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:03,906
make the educational portion of ramping up as fun as

330
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:07,662
possible. Now, if you or your senior

331
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:11,630
management think it's appropriate, you can go a step further

332
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,038
and create a culture of rewarding people for doing these

333
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:18,198
right things. So some examples could be

334
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:22,310
highlight well written postmortems in company or team meetings.

335
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,982
Reward closure of postmortem action items if

336
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:30,134
action items are documented but not acted upon,

337
00:21:30,262 --> 00:21:33,526
what's the point? Also acknowledge

338
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,940
that making systems more reliable is high impact work,

339
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:43,274
and then reward such work in your performance. Assessments regarding

340
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:47,070
postmortem owners as leaders can be very motivating.

341
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,102
Setting up the postmortem owner as the go to person for

342
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:54,546
resolving or mitigating a failure can be very rewarding for

343
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:58,420
some people. If your senior management is on board,

344
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,882
it is okay to even publicly celebrate a person who

345
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:06,690
actually was the proximal cause of a big outage,

346
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,258
but then who also acted effectively and sensibly

347
00:22:10,354 --> 00:22:13,746
to either escalate or troubleshoot or mitigate

348
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:17,750
or resolve that outage, and who honestly then documented system

349
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,050
failures that allowed them to make that mistake.

350
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,338
This is again to emphasize that even if it's clearly a person

351
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:29,146
who can be held responsible, that it was always a

352
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:32,526
set of conditions and system failures that allowed things to

353
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:36,510
happen in the first place. You can also celebrate people

354
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,310
for finding and fixing reliability bugs.

355
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,986
Another idea is to invite folks to talk about failures and

356
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:46,660
lessons learned on a high visibility platform.

357
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,478
This could help normalization of conversations

358
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:54,754
around failure. All of these ways are

359
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,454
some great examples to instill psychological safety in

360
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:01,480
current and especially newer members of the team.

361
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,478
You can do even more. So let's talk about that.

362
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:09,686
So remember, things slide we looked at previously. So now you've

363
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:13,718
done all this postmortem work, you're all experts at blamelessness,

364
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,370
and then you have a magically blameless orc,

365
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:21,386
but the work is not done yet. We still haven't completed

366
00:23:21,418 --> 00:23:24,666
the last step. We still haven't

367
00:23:24,698 --> 00:23:28,160
made sure that the same incident never occurs again.

368
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,190
Now, as a part of writing your blameless postmortem,

369
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,740
you documented many action items. So what happened to those?

370
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,266
Remember, the overarching reason we are doing all this work is

371
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:45,006
to prevent incidents from reoccurring. And if action

372
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,386
items remain unaddressed, you can be sure that incidents

373
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:52,114
are going to reoccur and maybe on a much bigger scale,

374
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:55,654
since complexity of our systems and processes is not

375
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:59,114
going down anytime soon. So in order

376
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:03,450
to do so, review postmortems and sections items periodically.

377
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,470
These action items can be around adding more monitoring, automated rollbacks,

378
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,686
automated release gating, or even more refactoring of

379
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,286
the existing code base. If a

380
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:20,234
company doesn't have preexisting tooling around postmortem action item

381
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:23,840
management, one can look at third party tools. Also,

382
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,354
what process you follow, how simple or hard it is

383
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:31,506
can depend on your team, but it's important that you

384
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:35,674
do it in the first place. Otherwise, what's the point of accumulating

385
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:40,194
these action items in your postmortem? Sometimes reoccurring

386
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:43,718
postmortem reviews can also give you a sneak peek into maybe

387
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:47,806
some themes that are emerging, and you can then combine those themes

388
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:51,930
into a bigger project and then prioritize fixes accordingly.

389
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,726
Now, with a growing number of postmortems being written every quarter,

390
00:24:56,918 --> 00:25:00,178
the next big stretch goal could be creation of tools

391
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:04,362
to aggregate these postmortems and identify common themes

392
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:07,630
and break for improvement across product boundaries.

393
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,886
One can work on machine learning projects where they

394
00:25:11,908 --> 00:25:16,370
can teach a model to preempt outages based on past patterns.

395
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:21,486
Encourage folks to keep their trans encourage folks

396
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:24,942
to keep their postmortems accessible by all.

397
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:28,822
As a default, this will encourage transparency and

398
00:25:28,876 --> 00:25:32,930
reinforce the concept of using failures or postmortems

399
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,560
as a learning opportunity for the company.

400
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,166
And then let's not forget that without intentional nurturing,

401
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:43,900
any sort of culture can ultimately fizzle out.

402
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,540
The breakdown of postmortem culture may not always be obvious.

403
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,034
Following are some common failure patterns and then recommended

404
00:25:53,082 --> 00:25:56,894
solutions that might work so lack of

405
00:25:56,932 --> 00:26:01,406
time quality postmortem culture time to write when

406
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:05,042
a team is overloaded with other tasks. The quality

407
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:09,454
of postmortem culture so prioritize postmortem

408
00:26:09,502 --> 00:26:13,342
work, track its completion and review, and allow teams

409
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,774
adequate time to implement the associated plan.

410
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:20,722
If teams are experiencing failures that mirror previous

411
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:24,390
incidents, it could be time to dig a bit deeper.

412
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,962
So consider asking questions like are

413
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:31,642
action items taking too long to close? Are we

414
00:26:31,696 --> 00:26:34,730
biased towards feature velocity over reliability?

415
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:39,180
Are the right action items been captured in the first place?

416
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,830
Or maybe the service is overdue for a refactor?

417
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,400
Next point is blameful language while speaking with each other

418
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,442
responding when someone uses blameful language can be very

419
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:55,774
challenging, especially if a person senior

420
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,946
than you is doing so. One trick is to

421
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:03,054
mitigate the damage by moving the narrative in a more constructive

422
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:06,802
direction, reminding them that investigating

423
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:10,486
the source of misleading information is much

424
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:13,990
more beneficial to the than assigning blame.

425
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,454
And these disengaging from the postmortem process is

426
00:27:18,492 --> 00:27:21,670
another sign that postmortem culture is

427
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,814
starting to fail. If folks seem content with

428
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:29,302
not discussing failures and maybe avoid the issue

429
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:33,530
altogether, it may be time to reinforce blamelessness

430
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,170
and ensuring that high visibility postmortem culture reviewed

431
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,830
for possible blameful wording.

432
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,570
All right, this brings me to my final slide.

433
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,682
In case you don't remember anything I said in the last

434
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:53,198
30 to 40 minutes, I hope these these key takeaways

435
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:56,438
stay with you. So number one,

436
00:27:56,604 --> 00:27:59,320
the cost of failure is education.

437
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,546
Number two, keep your postmortems blameless.

438
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:07,560
Focus on these system, not the people.

439
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,134
And then lastly, when written well,

440
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:15,378
acted upon and widely shared,

441
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:18,966
blameless postmortems can be a very effective tool

442
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:22,634
for driving positive cultural changes and also preventing

443
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:26,334
reoccurring errors. Thank you.

444
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:26,780
Thank.
