1
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:25,990
Um,

2
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,718
hello, everyone at Conf 42. My name is Cambodwai and

3
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:36,830
I am so excited to be speaking with you today. Today we're going to be

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,850
talking about how to build a sustainable accessibility program without wasting

5
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,326
a ton of time and money. And really, that this

6
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:47,960
is a smart business conversation. Let's get started here.

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,742
Look, I'll be the first to say disability and

8
00:00:51,796 --> 00:00:55,198
accessibility. Disability, inclusion. It's hard,

9
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:58,974
right? Even that word disability has some weight to it,

10
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:02,400
some connotation, and it may make people feel

11
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,746
uncomfortable on the inside. I want to say that's

12
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:10,514
okay. That's normal. It's not a bad word.

13
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:13,298
I think that's something that we all kind of get stuck on, right? We just

14
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:16,318
shouldn't even know if we should say the word disability.

15
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,414
But the truth is, it describes somebody,

16
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:23,574
whether it's acquired over time, something like a stroke or a car

17
00:01:23,612 --> 00:01:26,946
accident. Disabilities may be acquired in many ways, or it's

18
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:30,634
something that you're bored with. Maybe you had the cord wrapped around

19
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:34,026
your neck as a child when you were born, or you were born with an

20
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:38,102
extra chromosome. It's part of someone's identity.

21
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:42,110
It's kind of like being short or preferring video

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,806
captions or having glasses, which, by the way, is a disability as

23
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:49,802
well. It's okay to feel awkward or cautious

24
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:53,994
or maybe even ashamed when you're thinking your private

25
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:57,838
thoughts around disabilities. That's normal.

26
00:01:58,014 --> 00:02:01,346
We don't talk enough about it, and we don't want to offend people in

27
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:04,370
our daily lives. We don't want to say the wrong thing.

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,880
And that, my friends, means it comes from a good place.

29
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,566
Ultimately, though, it is that self consciousness that keeps us

30
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:17,106
from asking the right questions and therefore creating

31
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:20,422
an unconscious bias and exclusions

32
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:24,822
towards people with disabilities. Plus, nobody in our society

33
00:02:24,966 --> 00:02:28,794
really talks about disabilities, right? We normally don't learn

34
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:32,286
it from our parents. We don't talk about it at school, we don't go to

35
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:36,426
university and have classes on it. And plus, our HR departments

36
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,542
don't talk about it either. So my

37
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:43,626
goal for this presentation is to help two types

38
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:47,266
of people. Number one, if you are brand new to accessibility, if you've never

39
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:50,414
heard of disability inclusion before, I want to spark

40
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:54,050
some curiosity inside you. I want to talk to you about what the future

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,078
could hold and what maybe becoming a champion inside your

42
00:02:58,104 --> 00:03:01,606
organization would entail, and the possibilities that could come from

43
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:04,918
that as well. Number two, if you already know a

44
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:08,310
little bit of accessibility, if that's something that your organization has already

45
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,070
started, or if you yourself are a champion inside that organization,

46
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,754
I want to teach you a little bit of implementation techniques and

47
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:19,526
how to accelerate your plans going forward. I want to know what's

48
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:22,766
holding you back from creating a successful program.

49
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,806
Let's get started. All right.

50
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:29,790
In and over the next 45 to 60

51
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,614
minutes, my goal is to get you to believe that

52
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:38,158
a proper accessibility program is the key to being a differentiator

53
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:41,426
in your market. And I'm going to show you how we can do that

54
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:45,038
with a framework that will make it straightforward and simple to understand,

55
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:47,160
easy to achieve that result.

56
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,502
And now I'm really lucky. In the past nine years,

57
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:55,734
I've had some amazing opportunities to research

58
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:59,306
and run and practice accessibility programs within

59
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:03,398
large organizations like IBM, to speak at conferences,

60
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,570
major accessibility conferences, even like CSUN,

61
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,066
and go and help large organizations as well coach their teams

62
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,590
and employees who are already in the accessibility programs like VMware.

63
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,214
So I've been hosting a weekly podcast, Vodcast called

64
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:22,698
Normalize it, which speaks to the business of disability,

65
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:26,594
inclusion and accessibility. And I teach and coach people on

66
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:30,162
the same topics as well. But I started off much

67
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:32,926
like everybody else, right? I was ignorant,

68
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:36,454
totally ignorant towards what accessibility is, even how to spell it

69
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:40,214
right? Because everything for me started

70
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:44,082
with the handshake. Back when I was at IBM,

71
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:47,366
I was brought in as a junior developer to go work on an

72
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:51,110
accessibility project. We had a large banking organization

73
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,886
who had hired us to do something. Right, the typical analogy, nobody gets fired

74
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,554
for hiring IBM, right? In this project we had

75
00:04:58,592 --> 00:05:01,994
the client who was doing a lot of analysis and a lot of testing for

76
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:05,738
accessibility. We wanted to get on top of that because it was unacceptable

77
00:05:05,834 --> 00:05:09,338
for us to be releasing a product that had bugs contained

78
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:12,686
with it. There was a little bit of embarrassment. So I was brought in and

79
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,314
I read something called the web content accessibility guidelines,

80
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:19,874
the wikag for short. And this thing, when printed out, comes out to about

81
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:23,234
an inch thick. It's not a small document. I read

82
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,714
this, I was going through, I learned about it,

83
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:29,126
and I started to build accessibility into our

84
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:32,546
product. I started to fix those defects that the organization

85
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:35,862
thought were the first ones to fix. What was interesting,

86
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,786
though, is I'd never actually met an end user who

87
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:43,542
would benefit from my work around accessibility.

88
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:47,258
That wasn't until I met my friend Tom. Now it's important to

89
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:50,854
know that Tom is blind, and he travels around different IBM offices

90
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:54,382
to go and teach people about accessibility. When he finally

91
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:58,094
arrived at the Toronto office, my boss, who was a

92
00:05:58,132 --> 00:06:01,598
suave, kind of ex salesperson type,

93
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,510
have you ever had a boss like that, right? Walks around the office with a

94
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,066
popped collar. I know you have. I know you have. And he walked up to

95
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:11,346
Tom and his a type personality and stuck his hand in Tom's face

96
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:14,926
and said, hi, tom. My name is Jim. And there was this stare

97
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,570
down that happened because my boss,

98
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,426
Jim, had his hand stretched out, and Tom didn't

99
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:25,174
even know that hand was outstretched. I think I

100
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:29,334
died of embarrassment. I ran back to my desk and I walked, opened up YouTube,

101
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:32,540
and typed in how to shake a blind person's hand.

102
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,434
And it was really at that moment that I realized that this

103
00:06:37,472 --> 00:06:41,098
is all about people. Our products, our tools, the things that

104
00:06:41,104 --> 00:06:44,654
we build, the things that we work on are really only out there

105
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:47,774
to benefit people, right?

106
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:51,678
We want our product and service and technology and apps and all these things to

107
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:54,970
be used by as many people as possible. It doesn't make any sense for us

108
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,754
to build something that only works for a certain subsection of

109
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:02,354
the population. And by the way, if you ever want

110
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:05,838
to know how to meet somebody or greet somebody who's blind,

111
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:09,586
you can just say, can I shake your hand? And that'll cue

112
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:13,080
them up to extend their hand, and a connection has been made.

113
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,760
And if I could just make people see,

114
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,986
if I could just make people realize that people with disabilities care real people,

115
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:24,950
right? Then we would start to do this automatically.

116
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,034
If we could take out that uncomfortableness, that discomfort in thinking about

117
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:32,150
disabilities, then this, all of a sudden would start to become natural.

118
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,806
So the lesson here is that it's okay to talk about disability, it's okay to

119
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:39,486
ask questions, it's okay to be wrong, and it's also okay to

120
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:42,814
learn. So at that time,

121
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:46,434
I started to work on a framework, because in Canada, here, we are still so

122
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:50,114
much very compliant and regulatory based in

123
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:53,714
Canada. If you work in Canada, or if you sell products to Canada, you must

124
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:57,294
comply with something called AOTA, the Accessibility Frontiers with Disabilities

125
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:00,642
act. I'll get into a few more details as we go through the presentation,

126
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:04,534
but I was starting to be invited to all clients who had

127
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:07,654
regulatory buy in. That means airlines, that means banks, that means

128
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:10,986
insurance companies, transportation organizations, things like that.

129
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:14,426
They were starting to look for an accessibility tilt to

130
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:17,798
their projects. So this actually carried me throughout

131
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:20,974
my IBM career. I started to build a framework on how to

132
00:08:21,012 --> 00:08:24,670
apply a repeatable process towards accessibility.

133
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,094
So here are the three secrets to accessibility success.

134
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:34,010
Number one, stop the guesswork. How to make accessibility

135
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,762
simple to understand, quick to adopt, and easy to implement in as little

136
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:41,266
as eight weeks. So what does that mean? What if you

137
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,978
were confident to take the next step on your journey? And took out all

138
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:48,454
the guesswork that comes with starting a new initiative and were just given

139
00:08:48,492 --> 00:08:51,890
the right tools and the right vehicle to get moving in the right direction.

140
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,814
That's step number one. Number two, make you

141
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:59,354
say, wow. How a culture of dignity and

142
00:08:59,392 --> 00:09:02,970
delight keeps your best talent and employees.

143
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,202
What if you implemented all the best outcomes from companies like

144
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:12,046
Intuit and Netflix, PepsiCo, Walt Disney, VMware, Capital one,

145
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:15,518
Accenture, Slack, Mattel. Yes, even Barbie has

146
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:19,178
accessibility features and recognizes that disability

147
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:22,842
inclusion matters. Really, the list goes on and on and on.

148
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:26,350
And you create an organization that focuses on disabilities

149
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,390
inclusion and gives people right. People and clients,

150
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,700
employees that truly great experience. Get your people to say wow.

151
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,302
Number three, a $13 trillion market.

152
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:40,998
That's right, trillion with a t. How the world's best companies

153
00:09:41,084 --> 00:09:44,198
are leveraging accessibility and winning because of it.

154
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:48,070
What if you could establish a unique marketing position that

155
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,314
grows revenue and makes you stand out from the crowd? Because your competitors are

156
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:56,026
not doing this, by the way, and it could highlight some of

157
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:59,690
the best efforts that you've made and opens you up to an entirely new

158
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,326
market. All right, secret number one, let's stop the

159
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,926
guesswork. How do we make accessibility simple to understand, quick to

160
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:10,080
adopt, and easy to implement in as little as eight weeks?

161
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,090
All right, so remember I told you a little bit about that framework

162
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,158
that I developed while I was at IBM and started consulting with other organizations?

163
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:21,826
Well, how do we start to apply this in a

164
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:24,978
repeatable way? So, take out your pens and paper, because I'm going to walk you

165
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:28,546
through this framework. I call it the accelerated 180 framework,

166
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,854
and it's going to help you out with a bit more of a step by

167
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,160
step process. All right.

168
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,730
First, though, got to take a few steps back. Whenever I

169
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,690
show this slide, people always ask me, like, why do you have

170
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,522
pictures of two senior citizens on there?

171
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:49,778
Well, as we go through life, we start to acquire disabilities

172
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:53,098
right where we need glasses.

173
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:56,570
Arthritis sets in. We're not as mobile.

174
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,666
We're confined to our homes. Or maybe we have cognitive impairments

175
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:03,742
or disabilities that start to accumulate over time.

176
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:07,314
This is normal. This is natural. This is part of being

177
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:10,834
human. So when I was the accessibility lead

178
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:14,622
for IBM Canada, I was working on a project for bank of Montreal,

179
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:18,038
BMO apparent Canada. And accessibility was always kind

180
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,874
of approached in a haphazard kind of way, an ad hoc

181
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:25,110
kind of way. BMO blanket Montreal, at the time,

182
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,710
had purchased an accessibility audit for some of their

183
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,246
programs, some of their applications. And can you imagine if

184
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:35,158
you're a developer and all of a sudden you get slammed with an excel file

185
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,918
that has 800 defects on it, and they just didn't

186
00:11:38,934 --> 00:11:43,054
know how to figure it out. There was no implementation, there was no

187
00:11:43,172 --> 00:11:46,526
process, there was no structure in how to tackle that and

188
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:49,566
how to work on it as well. And it

189
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:53,198
sucked. I went to the 33rd

190
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:56,750
CSUN Assistive Technology conference. That's down in,

191
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,698
well, that was in San Diego, now it's in Anaheim in 2018.

192
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:03,102
And I actually spoke at that conference as well on colorblindness.

193
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:06,502
But what's really interesting is that gathering of so many other

194
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:10,306
accessibility professionals I got to meet and chat

195
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:13,682
with, talk to learn from chief accessibility

196
00:12:13,746 --> 00:12:17,538
officers, from some of these large organizations that I previously talked about,

197
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:20,454
including though, like Microsoft and Hilton, Slack,

198
00:12:20,502 --> 00:12:24,314
Adobe and Walmart. And these are all organizations that are leading the

199
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:28,170
charge for accessibility programs inside their organization.

200
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:32,298
And it's amazing. There are a lot of similarities

201
00:12:32,394 --> 00:12:36,442
between all these organizations and how they tackle

202
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:40,062
and apply accessibility. One of them, for example,

203
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:43,870
is this hub and spoke model where you have a centralized

204
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,158
team for accessibility in the organization, and they tend to, in quotes,

205
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:51,586
loan out their professionals to different parts of the

206
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:54,882
organization. Now, that works really well for large

207
00:12:54,936 --> 00:12:58,962
organizations, maybe that's not you, but even for smaller organizations,

208
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:02,898
having one, two or three champions who can go and consult

209
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:06,134
and are passionate about accessibility, are passionate about

210
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:10,122
helping people and disability inclusion, and they could be brought into other

211
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:14,038
projects throughout the organization, be it for HR or development

212
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:18,118
or procurement or any of these other types of processes. And what's

213
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:21,454
nice about this is that once you start to study and research

214
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:25,630
all these different patterns, a path and a plan

215
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,080
tends to be laid out in front of you.

216
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,550
So what is the framework itself?

217
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,134
So let's go through some of these, and I'll talk about

218
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:38,962
each point as I go through. So, number one, if you're going to apply

219
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:42,978
accessibility inside your organization, you need to know your current situation.

220
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:46,730
Right? What are the laws and regulatory considerations

221
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,450
for your projects? I talked a little bit before about AOTA

222
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,654
accessibility frontiers with Disabilities act. If you do

223
00:13:53,692 --> 00:13:56,630
business in the province of Ontario, up here in Canada,

224
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,270
you must be accessible.

225
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,174
Furthermore, there is the Accessible Canada act, the ACA,

226
00:14:03,222 --> 00:14:07,162
which is really coming into effect in 2035, and that's going to have a much

227
00:14:07,216 --> 00:14:11,002
higher prerogative for accessibility throughout

228
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:14,334
the country. Next up,

229
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:18,350
having an assessment, a maturity model assessment, to understand

230
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,870
every part of the business, every part of the organization, to understand

231
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,802
where they are in terms of accessibility. Now,

232
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:28,194
you may only be focused on products, and that's okay.

233
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:31,710
Are there checks and balances? Are there gates

234
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,794
involved in checking the accessibility for each part of

235
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:39,720
your process. That is all kind of considered in a maturity model.

236
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,022
Identify DEi initiatives. Now it's pretty amazing when I start to talk about

237
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:47,506
DEi, that this is the perfect place for

238
00:14:47,548 --> 00:14:50,714
accessibility to sit inside. Many people even will

239
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:55,078
change DeI to idea Ida,

240
00:14:55,174 --> 00:14:59,050
and the a includes accessibility in that conversation.

241
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,634
It's 2023. If your organization doesn't have a DEI

242
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:06,320
initiative, they're way behind the pack. Like, we've got to get moving on that first.

243
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,446
This current situation starts to form the

244
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:13,806
framework, starts to form the baseline towards what you

245
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:17,806
can be working towards, because there's no sense in shooting out in all different parts

246
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,266
of procurement. Let's go find some tools. Let's go do these

247
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:25,300
tests and audits if you don't even know where you currently are.

248
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,002
Next up, where's the destination? Where are you trying to go? Let's define

249
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:33,846
that future state so you can understand exactly where your

250
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:38,086
organization wants to go and where it should be. Now, every single

251
00:15:38,268 --> 00:15:42,038
country in the world has different laws around

252
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:45,206
accessibility. I talked to them a little bit earlier on when I talked about laws

253
00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:49,978
and regulatory if you're in the US, which you most likely are, section 508

254
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:53,114
is something that you need to pay attention to, as well as the ADA,

255
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:56,862
the Americans with Disabilities act. These both outline certain

256
00:15:56,916 --> 00:16:00,606
criteria and regulations and guidelines as to how to

257
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:04,538
make your software, your technology, and your organization accessible

258
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:08,574
for more users. You should be deciding on stakeholder

259
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:11,954
reporting as well. And I really believe that this is where a lot of people

260
00:16:11,992 --> 00:16:15,566
get stuck. They don't realize that stakeholders,

261
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:19,246
executives, c suite people, they need buy in

262
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:22,838
and they need reporting. They need to know what's the business benefits of

263
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:26,262
it as well. So you should be deciding on that early on and

264
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:29,642
getting feedback from that leadership team to understand what they want

265
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:33,642
to know about what they care about as well. And also building

266
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:37,542
that coalition. You can find people inside your organization,

267
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:41,386
peers and colleagues and allies to help you as

268
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:45,198
you're moving forward in the organization, to get your team members and

269
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,554
the rest of your organization to realize that they're not alone

270
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:52,206
in doing this. And finally, secure that buy in.

271
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,486
Prepare that executive presentation. Don't just go in there blindly.

272
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:59,762
Pull in and get buy in a little bit beforehand. Go for a soft close.

273
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:04,110
Have conversations with your leader, your engineering

274
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,130
team, your directors, your vps

275
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,814
of product engineering, maybe even HR, to kind of understand

276
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:15,654
and get an idea of where that presentation will land and

277
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:18,726
who care the best people to apply that for. And this,

278
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:22,406
by the way, can be applied anywhere. There's no sense in starting an initiative.

279
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:25,818
If you don't get a little bit of prior buy in before that, you want

280
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:29,718
to make sure you gather your timelines. Be very realistic.

281
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:33,134
Smaller organizations are a lot more agile, as we know. You don't need

282
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:36,682
meetings to start meetings. As anyone who's in a larger conversation

283
00:17:36,746 --> 00:17:40,254
knows, your timeline really needs to be thought

284
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,946
out. Well, I usually plan for a six to 18 month rollout whenever I'm

285
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:47,346
talking about this framework, and that is tends to be a nice

286
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:50,450
idea. But it's really important to know as well,

287
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,354
accessibility work is never done. Finally,

288
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:58,306
start to focus on a single measurable outcome that

289
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,494
you can do. There's no sense in calling and saying that we're going to make

290
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:04,934
the entire organization accessible. That's very

291
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:08,602
difficult to do. That is not really even a final goal. We can

292
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,814
really hone in on one specific part of the organization.

293
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:15,674
We can say in twelve months our HR department will

294
00:18:15,792 --> 00:18:19,686
incorporate accessible hiring practices. Or maybe our CI

295
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:23,642
CD continuous integration deployment pipeline will include some automated

296
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:27,482
tools to check for accessibility, and we're going to reduce

297
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,606
that defect count from whatever,

298
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,906
300 down to 80 within the next six months. That is a

299
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:37,298
measurable, attainable goal. I know what

300
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:41,150
you're probably thinking. This sounds pretty expensive,

301
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,798
right? For time and money to implement. And not going to lie,

302
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:48,770
that's probably correct. Every project, every new initiative

303
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,550
costs time and money. But I want to

304
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,246
talk to you about the alternative. What if you didn't do

305
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,854
this? What if you didn't apply this? What if you didn't start to consider this

306
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:01,498
now? Have you ever heard of Target? Of course you have. If you're in the

307
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:05,066
US large box store, right? Sells lots of products. In 2008,

308
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:09,062
they received a class action lawsuit because blind

309
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:13,262
users couldn't use screen reader technology, and they

310
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:17,182
claimed that they wanted to acquire the same information and

311
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:20,974
engage in the same transaction as are available to

312
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:25,294
cited use guests with substantially equivalent ease.

313
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:29,026
Now that's a pretty loaded statement. Basically what it means is

314
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:32,286
that we want equivalent access. We don't want barriers or blockers

315
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:35,570
or any kind of blocks to access

316
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,430
the same things, right? Even the checkout wasn't possible. You can imagine

317
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,462
you're trying to buy something, you add things to the cart, and then finally,

318
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,902
just before you're ready to purchase something, you hit the submit button,

319
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:50,566
you hit the buy now button, and that buy now button doesn't

320
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,340
work. That's how frustrating would that be?

321
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,754
So the suit against Target was

322
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:01,034
first filed early in 2006, and that Baltimore

323
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:05,114
based National Federation of the Blind, which claimed that Target contained

324
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:08,874
thousands. That's right. Thousands of access barriers,

325
00:20:08,922 --> 00:20:12,458
making it difficult, if not impossible, for blind customers

326
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:16,354
to use. That's bad.

327
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:20,174
It was a $6 million lawsuit.

328
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,020
That can get pretty expensive. So what was the action here?

329
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,922
They built an accessibility program. Without this plan,

330
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,282
without this rollout, none of this would have worked if they just started to audit

331
00:20:31,346 --> 00:20:34,674
and figure this out. Well, you don't even know where you are. You're not involving

332
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:38,706
the community. You're not getting feedback from users

333
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,674
who will benefit from that fix.

334
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:45,686
The program manager, who, by the way, I met at that CSUN conference

335
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:49,194
in 2018, he was talking about how he

336
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:52,998
had to hold off lawyers on one side, had to hold off lawmakers

337
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:56,206
on the other side, had to hold off his managers and his stakeholders on the

338
00:20:56,228 --> 00:20:59,546
other side because he didn't want to just do a bunch

339
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:03,742
of stuff. He wanted to roll this out with thought and clarity,

340
00:21:03,886 --> 00:21:07,342
because without a functional plan, they never would have achieved

341
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:10,706
success. And now Target goes and

342
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,514
speaks at CSUN. Target goes and talks about their progress towards a

343
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:16,610
more accessible, equitable,

344
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,534
inclusive organization. And now, look, they're even

345
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:24,738
using it as a benefit. Up on screen here, I've got their bullseye

346
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:27,160
view, which is their corporate website,

347
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,338
and it talks about how Target's inclusive costumes are back

348
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:35,414
with double the Halloween fun. This is reality.

349
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:39,386
This is real life. Here, look. They now have an accessibility plan.

350
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:43,482
They're committed to a web content accessibility guidelines, a Wakag

351
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:47,034
standard. They work with advocacy groups,

352
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:50,462
they work with people who are users of their

353
00:21:50,516 --> 00:21:54,514
products. They have an accessibility center of excellence, they have an accommodation policy,

354
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:57,730
and they're an inclusive work environment, which, by the way,

355
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,050
talk about a little bit more about that afterwards.

356
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,722
Secret number two, make you say,

357
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:08,226
wow, how a culture of dignity and delight keeps

358
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:10,870
your best talent and employees and clients.

359
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,790
So I used to not know about

360
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,354
or care about people with disabilities, either. All right, I'll be the first to admit

361
00:22:20,402 --> 00:22:23,706
that. Before 2014, before I joined IBM, before I started to pay attention to

362
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:27,434
this, I was totally ignorant towards the world of disabilities as

363
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,370
well. I didn't have any family members who had a disability.

364
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,090
I'm colorblind, but I never really thought of that as a disability

365
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,642
either. But with just a few adjustments

366
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:41,550
and few small changes to my mindset and approach to accessibility,

367
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,634
I didn't only make this easy, but I made it fun as

368
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:49,346
well. Right? If I could just get into

369
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,186
the habit of questioning what I did before I

370
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:56,258
released something, just for a moment, thought of if I was

371
00:22:56,264 --> 00:22:59,558
in a wheelchair, would I be able to access this if I had

372
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:03,058
a heavy cognitive load which, by the way, I don't

373
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:06,390
talk about it very much in this presentation, but in other presentations, I remind everybody

374
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,066
that we've all experienced a disability at some point.

375
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,446
If you're walking outside when the sun's shining down on your phone and you can't

376
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:17,020
read it, yeah. You've become temporarily disabled to

377
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,302
booking a flight or checking your transit times, things like that.

378
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:25,306
Or if you've had a heavy cognitive load, you're worried

379
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:29,006
about things at home. You just had a baby. You haven't slept very much,

380
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:33,054
by the way. They've even done tests to show

381
00:23:33,092 --> 00:23:36,818
that you can be drunk. And that's pretty much equivalent to

382
00:23:36,824 --> 00:23:40,626
the mental state of someone who is extremely tired. So you have no doubt been

383
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:44,354
disabled at some point before. So what if we could just think

384
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:48,166
of people like that? What if we could just acknowledge that one day we

385
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:51,560
will all also be permanently disabled through just

386
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,478
age related disabilities and we can start thinking about that a

387
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:59,078
little bit earlier. Why would it

388
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:02,098
be a problem to think about something at the end? I mean, that's really where

389
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:05,418
a lot of our problems start.

390
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:08,394
When at the end of the project, we're going to go submit code, we think

391
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:11,146
our project is done. Then all of a sudden accessibility comes in and says,

392
00:24:11,168 --> 00:24:14,954
well, you didn't do this, you didn't fix that. That's a feel bad. So lessons

393
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:18,842
to you all, think about this a little bit earlier in your projects,

394
00:24:18,986 --> 00:24:22,586
in your processes, and in your deliverables, because then you won't

395
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,810
have to worry about this so much at the end. Look,

396
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,706
if we can just get people excited about doing the right thing,

397
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:32,334
then disability, inclusion, accessibility becomes natural,

398
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:34,260
it becomes simple and becomes easy.

399
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,054
So really we're talking about breaking and fixing. There care only

400
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:43,862
two reasons that people and companies fail at

401
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:47,678
accessibility. That's it. Number one is attitude,

402
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:50,986
number two is expertise. That's it. So what

403
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:55,174
I do when I go and help organizations, I help them decouple

404
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:58,710
this negative attitude towards accessibility,

405
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,774
right? And again, a lot of these are just natural thoughts. This is boring,

406
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:05,646
right? Developers say, I just want to do my own thing. Stop trying to tell

407
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:09,294
me how to write my code. This takes too much work.

408
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:13,214
It's not going to work. And especially this is difficult when a developer takes

409
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:16,954
designs, takes patterns from a designer,

410
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:20,546
and those haven't been made accessible either. And the tester comes back

411
00:25:20,568 --> 00:25:24,034
and says, hey, you didn't make this work. He's like, I didn't even make this.

412
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:27,102
I'm just following what was given to me,

413
00:25:27,256 --> 00:25:30,694
right? We don't talk about those disabilities and thoughts of like who

414
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:32,840
cares about this doesn't really benefit anybody.

415
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,174
Instead, we need to decouple and break all those have

416
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:41,046
conversations around what that negativity is so that people realize that they're

417
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:44,346
not alone in those thoughts. And I start to attach it

418
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:47,274
to positive ideas of opportunity,

419
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:51,374
things around social justice. We want to live in a world where

420
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:55,658
justice is right. We want to live in a fair and equitable environment,

421
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:59,322
fair and equitable organizations and society

422
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:03,418
as well, right? Many people who care about accessibility,

423
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:07,318
many people who think about this a little bit earlier and are accessible professionals

424
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:11,106
do this because they feel like they take a stand. This is the

425
00:26:11,128 --> 00:26:13,986
right way to do things. This is the best way to do things. And it

426
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:17,586
is simply the right thing to do. Right. We can build a

427
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:21,190
better code base. If you're more an engineer or product person,

428
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,122
if you are building something with a standard which is following

429
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:29,158
the HTML standard is 99% of the problem. That's it.

430
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:33,162
If you start to follow that standard to the t and not add create

431
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:37,146
buttons that are made of divs and things like that, you care going to create

432
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:40,474
naturally a better code base and a better product

433
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:44,382
for people with disabilities to use, right? And not thinking

434
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,134
about only that I'm doing this for someone other,

435
00:26:47,252 --> 00:26:51,322
that we're doing this for ourselves, our future selves. If we want to continue banking

436
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:54,702
using the same applications that we're currently using or run

437
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:58,034
and use the products or services that we currently use, we got to start thinking

438
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:01,666
about this a little bit earlier as well. Number two, around that

439
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,926
expertise, removing those knowledge barriers.

440
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:08,582
Accessibility can usually and often think of this as

441
00:27:08,636 --> 00:27:12,454
this ambiguous, amorphous, nebulous kind of

442
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:16,246
target. I don't know where to go. I'm not sure exactly where

443
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,646
to proceed with this. I don't know where to get the knowledge. I don't know

444
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:22,186
where to get answers. This person is telling me one thing, this person is

445
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,814
telling me something else. What do I do? Right? I'll admit

446
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:28,566
this work is complicated and it can be nebulous,

447
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:32,234
ambiguous as well. So we need to attach

448
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:35,774
that to knowing exactly where to get that

449
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:39,562
knowledge. Building internal knowledge bases involving

450
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:43,738
people with disabilities to get their proper feedback

451
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:47,774
on the products that you're building. Because then you'll

452
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:51,058
understand exactly what it's like to have somebody use your product.

453
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:54,514
It'll start to make you think, because we need to start to make

454
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:58,054
this availability. You need to know exactly where to go, who to listen to,

455
00:27:58,092 --> 00:27:59,240
where to get more information.

456
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,506
So around that idea of clarity, getting clarity

457
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:09,320
of exactly where to go next is really, really important.

458
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,546
And again, I know what you're probably thinking, again, okay, but who is an

459
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,586
example of someone who builds this at scale? Well,

460
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:19,858
intuit, they own turbotax, credit karma, Mint,

461
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:24,270
QuickBooks, Mailchimp. Right? 100 million customers,

462
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,898
both individuals and organizations. Small businesses,

463
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:32,030
self employed individuals, not a small company. This,

464
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,646
what we're talking about here, is the same problem that Intuit

465
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,700
was facing back in 2015.

466
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,062
So the chief diversity, equity and inclusion

467
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:47,766
officer, she even has in her statement, which is right on the Intuit website,

468
00:28:47,948 --> 00:28:51,526
underrepresented groups. And that is

469
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:55,606
exactly what people with disabilities are. It's really difficult when

470
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:59,794
you have a statement such as this and such a strong inclusion

471
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:03,910
statement on your website to not care about accessibility.

472
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,174
I would challenge you. I would challenge you to go and look at your corporate

473
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:11,214
company website and see if there's anything on inclusion there. I will bet

474
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:14,718
you there is. I'll bet you there's a

475
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:18,606
diversity group. I'll bet you there's groups for families or things

476
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:23,178
like that. It's 2023. Organizations are

477
00:29:23,204 --> 00:29:27,234
paying attention to this. Accessibility goes hand in

478
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:31,298
hand with DEi. So what

479
00:29:31,304 --> 00:29:35,102
did they do? The global accessibility and inclusion design

480
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:38,886
leader for Intuit, his name is Ted Drake. He needed this built in

481
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:40,200
a certain way.

482
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,366
First, they built it into their tech, they put gates into

483
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:49,554
their processes so code can't be released. They included

484
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:53,706
it into their design systems, into how they write text on

485
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:56,922
there. And as you can see here, they have this even posted on

486
00:29:56,976 --> 00:30:00,346
their website as well. I love this accessibility inclusion. And if

487
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:03,310
you look at the four links below, we've got accessible content,

488
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,482
we've got alt text, antiracist language. Inclusive content readability

489
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:11,150
is down there as well. These are all guidelines on how to create

490
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,282
better experiences for, again, clients and

491
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:18,850
employees alike. They built it into their culture,

492
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:22,498
which speaks to this. And again, now all this culture of

493
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:26,230
belonging and all this culture of evolution is all on their website,

494
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,134
available to read. And they've made it public. They've made this absolutely public on how

495
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:33,894
to make their organization better. They went

496
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,778
from three people caring about accessibility to

497
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:40,998
now over 1200 accessibility champions inside that organization.

498
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:44,726
It's really hard to not care about accessibility

499
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:48,394
when everywhere you look, there's someone else who

500
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:52,442
cares about accessibility. That's called pervasive

501
00:30:52,506 --> 00:30:56,480
and that's called a pervasive organizational change.

502
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:00,814
It's pretty cool, too. Intuit made it okay to

503
00:31:00,852 --> 00:31:04,094
talk about up on screen,

504
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:08,430
I've got a picture of the Intuit CEO, Sassan Gudarsi,

505
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,674
and he talks about the mission to power prosperity around

506
00:31:12,712 --> 00:31:16,354
the world and doing things for their customers, that network

507
00:31:16,402 --> 00:31:20,274
of 1200 accessibility champions, it really goes beyond

508
00:31:20,402 --> 00:31:24,246
compliance. What we're really talking about here is the

509
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:27,926
future of work. What kind of organizations do we want to be a part

510
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:30,220
of in the future? Do we want to help build?

511
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,886
Look, they didn't say we want to give wealth or increase

512
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:38,310
wealth or things like that. They talked about powering prosperity. And prosperity

513
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,918
means different things to different people. And he didn't say just to

514
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:45,662
some customers or a small segment of the population. He said

515
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:48,000
our customers, all customers.

516
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,606
Accessibility is part of the daily conversation across the company at

517
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:55,906
Intuit, says Ted Drake. And when you can

518
00:31:55,928 --> 00:31:59,746
start to have this, you can start to really start to change the way that

519
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:03,186
your organization evolves. And by the way, they're not

520
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,450
perfect. Accessibility, like everything else, it doesn't matter what you're doing,

521
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,686
whether you're implementing a new Javascript framework and

522
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:13,142
stuff like this, the work is never done and we need to stop thinking about

523
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:17,110
this is a one and done exercise. They recently hired an

524
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,554
intern who is deaf, and he talked about how there were

525
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:23,530
no captions on any of the onboarding videos.

526
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,790
Well, they got that fixed. And this is valuable feedback,

527
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,274
having that conversation and not being afraid to give that conversation.

528
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:32,670
This really is a two way street.

529
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,234
All right, secret number three, this is a $13 trillion

530
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:44,462
global market and how the world's best companies are leveraging accessibility and

531
00:32:44,516 --> 00:32:48,274
winning because of it. All right.

532
00:32:48,472 --> 00:32:51,986
I used to also think that accessibility was just a nice to have.

533
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:54,846
Even when I just got started and I was doing some of the development,

534
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:57,846
I was fixing those bugs. Many people would come to me and say, this is

535
00:32:57,868 --> 00:33:01,554
just nice to have. There's no business benefits to considering

536
00:33:01,602 --> 00:33:04,694
accessibility. And at

537
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:08,614
that time I didn't really see any other company either. Large know,

538
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:11,450
maybe there's some nonprofits doing this,

539
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,758
or maybe there's the organizations like the Canadian National Institute

540
00:33:14,774 --> 00:33:18,026
of the Blind, the CNIB. Maybe they cared about it. But why does

541
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:19,850
that matter to large organizations?

542
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,278
Well, once I started to learn more about these opportunities, once I

543
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:29,338
started to dig in a little bit deeper, I found that there's lots of organizations

544
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:32,866
who were doing this and they were winning clients because of it

545
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:36,354
too. They were using this as a differentiator on

546
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:39,634
how to use a marketing term or how

547
00:33:39,672 --> 00:33:43,042
to set themselves apart. By the way,

548
00:33:43,096 --> 00:33:47,426
the US Office of Disabilities Employment Policy categorizes

549
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:51,314
persons with disabilities as the third largest

550
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,234
market segment in the US, after Hispanics and African

551
00:33:55,282 --> 00:33:59,082
Americans. The discretionary income for

552
00:33:59,136 --> 00:34:02,378
persons of working age with disabilities is

553
00:34:02,464 --> 00:34:06,106
$21 billion. And that's greater than

554
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,050
the african american and hispanic segments combined.

555
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,582
Now that's a market opportunity. We can

556
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:17,454
be differentiators. We can stand apart from the crowd, and this

557
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:21,534
becomes a positive feedback loop that works for us and

558
00:34:21,572 --> 00:34:24,630
defends us also in the future against legal battles. And by the way, if you're

559
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:28,178
an individual contributor, maybe you don't manage a team, maybe you

560
00:34:28,184 --> 00:34:31,586
don't really have any bind with the stakeholders. That's okay.

561
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:35,326
You're part of this conversation too. You yourself can make

562
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:38,886
this part of your own work. Become that

563
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:41,106
differentiator, become essential.

564
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:44,454
I've survived layoffs because I've cared about

565
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:48,478
accessibility and I was the only one who did. I was that expert

566
00:34:48,674 --> 00:34:51,770
and that became my differentiator. That's how I became essential.

567
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,494
So distinguish and differentiate. Market growth opportunities

568
00:34:57,622 --> 00:35:00,806
do exist for people who care and organizations

569
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:04,478
who care about accessibility. They care access to a broader market.

570
00:35:04,564 --> 00:35:08,702
One in seven people have disabilities around the world. This is not a small number.

571
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:11,630
They have access to innovation and talent.

572
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,130
Also talent retention. If your best talent

573
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,866
understands that they belong in the organization and there may be

574
00:35:20,888 --> 00:35:23,854
people who you don't even know have disabilities inside your organization,

575
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:27,302
someone may be sitting next to you right now and they care.

576
00:35:27,356 --> 00:35:31,298
Neurodiverse, that may be you as well. When your organization

577
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:34,758
cares about people, when they start to incorporate these types of

578
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:38,690
things, naturally your best talent will want to stay and you'll attract

579
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,940
better people as well. Once you start to fix things like the job application process,

580
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,030
there is opportunities to identify lost revenue.

581
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,698
Selling into government requires something called a VPAT. If you sell a product,

582
00:35:50,864 --> 00:35:54,250
a voluntary product accessibility template,

583
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,994
this is just a self assessment, a self testament to the facts that you've

584
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:01,502
assessed your product for accessibility and you can sell towards government

585
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:05,620
now. Also, higher education is now requiring a

586
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,262
VPAT in many snares as well and larger organizations.

587
00:36:09,326 --> 00:36:12,562
I know the bank that I just left recently, they would

588
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:16,226
ask for a VPAT as well. You're not allowed to apply to

589
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:19,880
become a vendor towards this organization unless you have that in hand.

590
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,758
We talked about this a little bit about some of the risks around compliance and

591
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:28,066
brings like that, but really understanding that risk assessment, what are the laws,

592
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:31,926
what are the penalties, what are the fines involved? If you do not comply,

593
00:36:32,038 --> 00:36:35,306
this starts to hurt your bottom line. But finally though, and this is my

594
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:38,620
favorite one, plan your success story, right?

595
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,226
Your opposition, your competitors are not doing this. Stand apart

596
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:47,322
from the crowd and like I said before, use this to focus on your career

597
00:36:47,386 --> 00:36:51,710
as well. You're probably know

598
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,570
this probably isn't worth the effort. There's no business gains for accessibility.

599
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,290
There's a small company that puts a lot of effort towards accessibility.

600
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,014
Microsoft probably heard of them before. Satya Nadella,

601
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:08,034
the CEO of Microsoft. His son was severely disabled

602
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:11,938
with cerebral palsy when he became CEO.

603
00:37:12,034 --> 00:37:15,286
This truly was a top down driver from the

604
00:37:15,308 --> 00:37:19,050
top to care about accessibility. As a result,

605
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,390
Microsoft president Brad Smith prioritized accessibility

606
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,766
across all products. He funded

607
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:29,430
the AI for Accessibility program as part of Microsoft's

608
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,738
AI for good initiative. That is a $25 million

609
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:37,920
investment over five years. That is not a small chunk of change.

610
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,154
Look at this. What the heck is this thing? This is the Microsoft

611
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:45,598
adaptive controller. And you start to see these cool little brings that come out

612
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:49,854
of Microsoft. Bryce Johnson is an employee. He invented

613
00:37:49,982 --> 00:37:52,898
this controller, and if you want to know a little bit about this,

614
00:37:53,064 --> 00:37:56,098
it's almost looks like a tablet. It's got two large buttons on

615
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:59,218
it, a and b buttons, a dpad, but there's

616
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:03,126
a bunch of icons near the top. And what that is, is those are

617
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:07,062
all inputs you can plug in, plug and play

618
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:11,078
devices of your own assistive technology. There's buttons

619
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:14,694
and tabs, sip puff devices just like they sound, eye tracking.

620
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:18,650
They can all go in there and create the inputs

621
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,690
for Microsoft. For the Xbox.

622
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,926
That's really cool. They've got seeing AI, which uses

623
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,878
computer vision, can speak the text as soon as it appears on screen,

624
00:38:28,964 --> 00:38:33,354
can even identify color. They've got automatic captions for teams. They've got accessibility

625
00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:36,898
checkers on all Microsoft 365 products.

626
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:40,574
Accessibility features an edge. I know a lot of people are like, who uses edge?

627
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:44,066
But fact is, when you start to think about an

628
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:47,394
organization like Microsoft implementing accessibility into all

629
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:50,918
their products, they've got a differentiator. I'm just going to show a

630
00:38:50,924 --> 00:38:54,646
quick video. This is a Microsoft video. My name

631
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,766
is Grover. Sean. My name is Ian. I'm Taylor. My name

632
00:38:57,788 --> 00:39:01,210
is Owen, and I am nine and a half years old.

633
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,190
So Owen was born with a rare genetic disorder called Escobar syndrome.

634
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:08,586
He's had 33 surgeries to

635
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:11,774
date. I love video games, my friends,

636
00:39:11,972 --> 00:39:16,094
my family, and again, video games. It's his

637
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:19,854
way of interacting with his friends when he can't physically otherwise do

638
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:24,010
it. What I like about the adaptive controller

639
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,874
is now everyone's companies. You can just say, all right,

640
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:30,660
that's that button. That's that button. That's that button.

641
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,974
Perfect. One of the biggest fears early on is how

642
00:39:35,032 --> 00:39:38,726
will Owen be viewed by the other kids? He's not

643
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:42,358
different when he plays. No matter

644
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:46,374
how your body is or how fast you are, you can

645
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:50,460
play. It's a really good thing to have in this world,

646
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,140
right? When everybody plays, we all win.

647
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,066
This is beyond compliance, my friends. This is differentiating

648
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:06,990
yourselves from your competitors.

649
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,218
I've got a friend at Microsoft. He's the director of product accessibility

650
00:40:12,314 --> 00:40:15,646
up here in Canada. His name is Dave Dame and he himself is disabled.

651
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:18,514
He has cerebral palsy and he says,

652
00:40:18,712 --> 00:40:22,146
we will all become disabled one day. Just some of us

653
00:40:22,168 --> 00:40:23,140
got here first.

654
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,014
So, quick summary here, three secrets to accessibility success. Number one,

655
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,854
stop the guesswork. Let's plan for and develop for

656
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:36,502
accessibility. Let's create a roadmap towards accessibility success.

657
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:39,846
Make it simple to understand, quick to adopt and easy to implement.

658
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:43,846
Number two, make you say wow. Create delightful experiences

659
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:47,082
for both customers and employees. And finally,

660
00:40:47,136 --> 00:40:50,640
number three, it's a $13 trillion global market.

661
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,390
Create and stand out from the crowd.

662
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,434
The world's best companies are already leveraging accessibility, and they care winning

663
00:40:59,482 --> 00:41:03,006
because of it. Nobody wants to be

664
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:06,558
excluded from anything. I want you to take a moment here to think about a

665
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,938
time that you were excluded. Maybe it was in the past, it was a

666
00:41:09,944 --> 00:41:13,410
party back in the days. Maybe it was an event

667
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,954
that you really wanted to go to and you're told you weren't supposed to.

668
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:19,320
Maybe it was a promotion. That's a big one.

669
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:23,554
And I think if we don't consciously think about the exclusions

670
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:26,818
that we create in our own environments, our own products and tools,

671
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:30,598
services, job descriptions, employment opportunities,

672
00:41:30,774 --> 00:41:34,506
then we can leave people behind. And nobody wants to do that. I know

673
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:35,900
nobody wants to do that.

674
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,626
One in seven people around the world have a disability.

675
00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:45,134
And this is from the World Health Organization. And this

676
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,470
includes people who wear glasses,

677
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,514
who have anxiety, who have long Covid, have experienced

678
00:41:51,562 --> 00:41:55,394
trauma, mental health conditions, who have experienced a stroke, who have

679
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:59,422
Alzheimer's, who have heart disease. It's veterans who have PTSD.

680
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:03,474
It's amputees. People, of course, who are born blind, who have become blind over

681
00:42:03,512 --> 00:42:07,110
time, people who born with hearing loss or

682
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,320
develop hearing loss over time as well.

683
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,320
This means that in a group of 100 people,

684
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,500
15 or so care going to have a disability. Something to think about.

685
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,102
