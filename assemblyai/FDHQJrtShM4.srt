00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,608
Hello and welcome to my talk. We can't all be Shaq.

2
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:24,116
Today we'll dive into why instant heroes need to pass the ball my

3
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:27,556
name is Malcolm Preston. I've been in the technology world for most of

4
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:30,790
my life, since my father bought a Xerox personal computer when I was a child.

5
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,496
I've held many different titles over the years, but all heading generally

6
00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:38,540
towards the same outcome. My passion is to make complex systems work.

7
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,136
Currently, I work at Fire Hydrant, where we envision a world where all software

8
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:46,044
is reliable. Fire Hydrant operates in the incident management space and

9
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,816
reliable software lines up perfectly with my other passion for getting a good night's

10
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:53,040
sleep. This talk will not focus on some specific

11
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,832
technical product we use or how we scale to accommodate a huge increase in customer

12
00:02:56,886 --> 00:03:01,900
traffic. Instead, this talk will focus on basketball.

13
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,456
Now bear with me. I know this isn't the topic of most tech talks,

14
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:09,248
but my hope is within a few minutes it'll become clear how incident response

15
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:13,012
and basketball go together like copy and paste. I enjoy

16
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:16,424
watching sports, not so much to root for a particular team,

17
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:20,296
but I enjoy watching how teams adapt and work together, especially when

18
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,656
they're facing adversity. I've often been intrigued over

19
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:27,236
the years why certain company seem better than others in various aspects

20
00:03:27,268 --> 00:03:31,176
of their operations, similar to sports teams at

21
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,868
a going away party for a job I was leaving a few years back,

22
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:37,404
the VP of engineering told a story I didn't even remember, but that I know

23
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:40,524
subconsciously shaped how I viewed my role in the team.

24
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:43,856
While sitting on a new hire orientation session toward the end

25
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:47,632
of my very first day at the company, an issue arose with some internal system

26
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:51,616
with zero context. I pulled but my laptop, figured out what was going on

27
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,816
and helped fix the issue. After that, every time there was

28
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:57,456
an incident, the VP said as soon as he saw my name in the slack

29
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,390
chat, he felt a sense of relief and knew we'd be okay.

30
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,124
My story isn't unique. In fact, most organizations I talk

31
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:08,328
to have a handful of people or teams who swoop in and save the

32
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:11,688
day when a technical crisis arises. When the 02:00 a.m.

33
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,564
Outage page goes out, they're the first ones to respond.

34
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:18,708
These nebulous heroes find the problem, determine the affected areas,

35
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:22,236
fix the issue, or know who to call to fix the issue. Wake up the

36
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:25,804
VP, draft messages to send to customers and other stakeholders, then create

37
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:29,308
tickets to address why things went bad. The next day at

38
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:32,748
09:00 a.m. They go back to the job they were hired to do. Their backs

39
00:04:32,764 --> 00:04:35,936
are padded and life goes on back to normal until the next

40
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:40,588
02:00 a.m.. Page I like to equate these people to Shaq.

41
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:44,668
Shaquille O'Neill is 7ft one inch tall and weighs well over 300

42
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:48,096
pounds. Any team he played for knew if they desperately

43
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:51,536
needed two points, they could pass the ball to Shaq and a thunderous

44
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:55,332
dunk was likely to follow. I'd wager most of you either know someone

45
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:58,170
who was a Shaq or you play that role yourself.

46
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
These incident response heroes aren't usually 7ft tall,

47
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,072
but when a moment arises when the team needs a quick victory, these people always

48
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:09,756
seem to come through in the clutch. If you've been this person at your company,

49
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:13,436
you know how good that can feel. You also know how exhausting it

50
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:17,640
can be. Why is this a problem? As individuals,

51
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,772
we bring our talents every day with a goal of some kind of personal satisfaction.

52
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,264
That satisfaction could be monetary compensation, pride in doing good

53
00:05:25,302 --> 00:05:28,784
work, helping the team, changing the world, or any other

54
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:32,640
personal motivation. A team brings these groups of individuals together

55
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,924
under some guidance with a goal of winning games while theyre together

56
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:40,244
in sports. It could be a year or a season in your company that

57
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:43,812
time can frame could revolve around quarterly goals or maybe

58
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,392
longer term projects. An organization continually

59
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:51,076
sponsors teams with the goal of repeating success on a long term

60
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:55,236
basis year over year. It's true when you have individuals

61
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:57,784
operating like Shaq, games are getting won,

62
00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:01,572
incidents are getting resolved, but are you truly setting your organization

63
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:05,310
up for longer term success by just doing it for them every time?

64
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,724
The problem for a lot of organizations is Shaq makes

65
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:13,100
dunking look easy, incidents are being remediate,

66
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,136
and nobody else is really feeling the pain, so much so that your

67
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:20,316
company might not think there's a problem. And without the tools

68
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:23,676
or headcount to make a sweeping change, it turns into a self fulfilling

69
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,916
prophecy. There's no great system in place, but you know

70
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,910
what to do, so you just end up continuing to do it.

71
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,276
This negates the need for a system and puts the onus track on you.

72
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,976
Even as an individual contributor, there needs to be an understanding of what

73
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:41,176
is best for the organization long term. While it

74
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:44,952
may feel good to be the center of attention and a key contributor to success,

75
00:06:45,086 --> 00:06:49,160
establishing long term sustainable processes will help the organization

76
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,764
in the future. I'd like to share

77
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:56,456
another personal anecdote about the time I got a new observability tool adopted

78
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:59,944
at a previous employer. As a company, we became heavily

79
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:03,216
invested in self hosting a NoSQL database I had

80
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:06,636
used that product in the past and became one of de facto resources

81
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:10,076
when anything bad or puzzling happened that might be related to that database

82
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:13,884
platform. At some point I realized I had become a bottleneck

83
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:17,028
in terms of support, and to be honest, I felt a little uncomfortable with the

84
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:20,736
amount of stress that brought knowing I'd be integral in just about any issue involving

85
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:24,132
these database deployments, which had proliferated to just about every

86
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:27,496
microservice we created. I researched and

87
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:30,792
advocated for a database monitoring analysis tool that could help

88
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:34,628
the rest of our teams self service and bring more reliability to the systems

89
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:37,844
that theyre were responsible for. When I was met with skepticism

90
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:41,196
around why we even needed a product like this, I realized no one

91
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:44,780
else thought there was a problem to solve, because every time there was an incident

92
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,016
Shaq in a pre Covid world, I often gleaned

93
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:52,980
a lot of peripheral information around what other teams were doing. By happenstance,

94
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,960
someone might want to introduce a new infrastructure component theyre weren't familiar with,

95
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,496
and they might ask for advice. Or I might hear about some upcoming change or

96
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:02,720
challenge just from casual conversation.

97
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,124
I'd say the vast majority of the service dependency matrix in my head at past

98
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:09,910
companies originated from water cooler talk.

99
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,940
In a past era, it might have been through smoke break conversations.

100
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,184
Unfortunately, in a post Covid world, most of us are working

101
00:08:18,222 --> 00:08:21,656
under further siloed environments just because we rarely see our

102
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:25,464
coworkers face to face, and in some cases, there's less communication outside

103
00:08:25,502 --> 00:08:27,820
of immediate work related conversations.

104
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,540
This facilitates the need to codify what incident responders do

105
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,952
and who should be involved in various scenarios. One heroes

106
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,440
knowing where all the bodies are buried, swooping in and saving the

107
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,032
day is becoming less of a reality. Times change,

108
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:48,080
technology changes, and platforms are becoming more and more complex.

109
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,556
What worked in the past doesn't always work in the present or

110
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:55,124
in the future. Sometimes Shaq gets

111
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:58,832
tired. Sometimes Shaq gets hurt.

112
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:02,288
Burnout is a real thing, and let's

113
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:05,896
be honest, sometimes Shaq isn't the easiest team member to get

114
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:10,104
along with. Kobe so

115
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:11,530
where do we go from here?

116
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,948
It's time to pass the ball. To get out of this cycle of heroes,

117
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:20,456
you as an individual have to commit to changing reliability culture

118
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:23,836
at your organization. I always recommend people start with

119
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:26,350
a few small steps and then grow from there.

120
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,480
First, if the contents of your company's service,

121
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,060
catalog dependencies, documentation, and incident management

122
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,920
communication workflow are all in your head, you're in trouble.

123
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,508
What happens when you're not around? Take the first step toward formalizing

124
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:45,888
an incident management runbook. This doesn't have to look like setting

125
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:49,270
aside a full day to write a step by step process. Instead,

126
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,156
take the start small approach of talking to yourself during an

127
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:57,256
incident. The next time you respond, start a thread in the incident channel where

128
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,108
you literally just think out loud, be over communicative,

129
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:05,210
and don't assume your teammates understand why you're taking the actions you sre

130
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,088
think in terms of I just got paged. What's the first thing I do?

131
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:13,150
Where are the places I look to check on the statuses of our services?

132
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,310
How do I know who to call when I discover what service is down?

133
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,784
How do I know how to revert the last deploy for that service? What impact

134
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:24,780
does this incident have on customers and internal teams?

135
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,650
What are my thoughts on how to fix this issue going forward?

136
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,208
These are all questions you're answering in your head in an organic way

137
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:35,988
because you're the one who knows how to do this. By documenting your process,

138
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:39,396
you're taking the first steps to getting that info out of your head and

139
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:43,376
eventually into an incident management tool or company wiki breaking

140
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:46,628
that silo. Step two,

141
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:50,696
you know who looks up to Shaq? Everyone. And the same

142
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:54,152
is probably true of you. Become an incidents commander and give the other members

143
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:57,816
of your team the opportunity to learn to expand their own skills and

144
00:10:57,838 --> 00:11:01,644
to bask in that hero's glow. A team benefits from players who

145
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:05,532
have differing specific roles and specialties, all working together under

146
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:09,544
sound coaching and organizational direction. The best responders

147
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:13,056
facilitate communication and collaboration, so the next time an

148
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,780
incident arises, instead of taking on the shack role, be a point guard

149
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,780
or a coach. Simply hang back, provide assists

150
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,368
and guidance, give people the info they need, or better yet,

151
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:27,696
help them figure out where to find it, and lend a hand when you're

152
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,188
asked. Once you've done this a couple of times, maybe miss a

153
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:34,656
game or two, see if not being on call as an option for the sake

154
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:37,690
of your own health, but also to help others step up.

155
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,416
Instead, work on a special project like taking the

156
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:45,690
initial efforts towards formalizing the documentation you started from the first step.

157
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,356
There's no better way to flag a weakness up the chain of command than by

158
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:53,176
demonstrating what happens when you're not there to fix things, and that's

159
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,540
a surefire way to direct some resources toward incident management.

160
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,688
Step three question the status quo. Let's talk

161
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:05,040
about the big o's on call and observability.

162
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,148
What does on call look like at your company? Are you alerting

163
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:13,116
on every down instance or only the ones that impact your customers celebrated?

164
00:12:13,228 --> 00:12:16,468
Are you using service level objectives, if not,

165
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:20,468
what's standing in the way of adopting them. Depending on how noisy your

166
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,336
alerting systems are, being all call for even a week might be a totally unreasonable

167
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,832
amount of time. What observability tools are you using?

168
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:31,476
Can other teammates easily find the relevant data they need to triage

169
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:34,708
an incident? Lastly, what tools

170
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:37,896
are you using to manage your incidents? How are incidents

171
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:42,408
declared and under what circumstances? Are you conducting retrospectives?

172
00:12:42,504 --> 00:12:46,300
And if so, how do you influence product roadmaps?

173
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,420
Why were any of these tools chosen? When and by whom?

174
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,450
And do these tools fit the way your team works?

175
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,936
We have to improve the on call and incident response experience for our engineers in

176
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,536
order to reduce burnout and retain our colleagues. We also

177
00:13:03,638 --> 00:13:06,884
want to be able to assemble a winning team even when the seven foot oneal

178
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:10,036
inch star is unavailable. This will allow

179
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:13,984
us to thrill our customers with the projects that directly impact revenue

180
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:18,200
producing products and features. Direct your hero energy to making the entire

181
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,200
process better, not just remediate ad hoc incidents.

182
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,456
These first steps sre all moving toward a common goal, and that's to move away

183
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:30,044
from the whack a mole style incident response to a more strategic and

184
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:33,464
holistic incident management. If you're playing the hero

185
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:37,164
role at your organization, you might be unintentionally masking the need

186
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:39,180
for better incident management practices.

187
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,704
This isn't your fault, though, and you're not alone. By helping

188
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:47,656
our companies shift toward a better incident management posture, we can improve

189
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:51,260
things for our customers, for our teammates, and for ourselves.

190
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,480
Thank you for joining.
