00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,558
Hi. Thank for taking the time to listen to my talk about how to

2
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:31,394
sell chaos engineering tooling into your company. My name is Andrew

3
00:00:31,442 --> 00:00:34,902
Benoit and prior to serving as a Gotomarket advisor for early

4
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:38,822
phase startups, I spent about a decade working for companies like

5
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:42,050
Datadog, Gremlin, harness, and Codecuff,

6
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,734
and working with customers to solve their reliability problems.

7
00:00:45,932 --> 00:00:49,126
Now, if you'd like to connect after the conversation, please feel free to

8
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:51,822
add me on LinkedIn in or you can reach out to me at the email

9
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:53,520
address that I have listed below.

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,774
Now, the goals for our session are pretty simple.

11
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:01,518
I want to make it as easy as possible for you to understand how to

12
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:05,358
get the maximum value out of your sales rep. Turn him

13
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:08,750
from a thorn in your side, potentially into an actual asset.

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,226
I want to coach you on how to lobby internally to your

15
00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:15,630
peers, understand when someone's truly a supporter or a blocker,

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,666
and how to proceed accordingly. I want to teach you how to avoid

17
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:23,030
a lot of the mistakes that I've seen project leaders make

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,026
in trying to get approval for budgetary spend and resources.

19
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:30,326
And lastly, I've kind of noticed a lot of the people that I've worked with

20
00:01:30,348 --> 00:01:33,994
that were volunteered to lead the initiative are

21
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:37,306
quite often not understanding that they're being

22
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:40,474
viewed as a potential leader for the future. Your organization is

23
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:43,846
trying to see how you serve as a public face, and they're

24
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:47,086
trying to see that you understand the business value of the

25
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,606
decisions that you make on behalf of the company. So I want to give you

26
00:01:50,628 --> 00:01:54,186
everything that you need to make a really cohesive ROI statement

27
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:57,746
to your leadership team. So that should an advancement opportunity come

28
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:00,754
up in the future, they view you in as good of a light as possible

29
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:02,660
and you're able to get that position.

30
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,302
Now let's kick things off with the fun part, the sales rep owner's manual.

31
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:11,926
And I use this verbiage very intentionally because I want to make

32
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:15,442
it clear, if you had a couple of calls with a vendor, congratulations.

33
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:18,440
From our perspective, you pretty much own us.

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,086
Now, I know salespeople get a bad rap, and I get it. Look at this

35
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,126
guy in this image. He looks like the bad guy in every 80s movie.

36
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:28,506
But there are a ton of misconceptions about how salespeople are

37
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:31,898
trained and how we're incentivized. And I'm hoping that bringing light to these will make

38
00:02:31,904 --> 00:02:36,014
you all feel much more comfortable in working with us. For one,

39
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:40,350
enterprise sales keeps in highly complex enterprise software sales

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,786
are some of the more seasoned sales reps you're going to work with. They're responsible

41
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:47,186
for bringing millions of dollars of revenue a year, and these jobs are really hard

42
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,546
to get in the sales world, and we are not trained to

43
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:53,790
never take no for an answer. Time and resources are limited.

44
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,458
Reps can have dozens of demo requests a month, and only a small fraction of

45
00:02:57,464 --> 00:03:00,518
those meetings ever actually go anywhere because it's simply not a

46
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:04,440
fit. The timing isn't right and it doesn't make sense to waste anybody's time.

47
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,234
Every week, sales teams have forecast calls with their leaders and effectively

48
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:13,270
have to explain in front of the whole team how their activities

49
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,610
are leading to revenue generation goals.

50
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,314
They're expected to be able to explain in great detail the technical fit,

51
00:03:20,432 --> 00:03:24,154
why the customer choose their own solution over others, who's involved

52
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:27,934
in the process, and what the timeline is. For example, if this goofy looking guy

53
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:31,454
here tries to close every project, but every

54
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:34,922
week it's clear in his forecast calls that he's just elongating engagements

55
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:38,994
that don't have any likelihood of closing because the technical fit isn't there or

56
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:42,786
he can't confirm a timeline or that budget is available. Well, he's not

57
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:46,398
going to have much fun in those forecast calls, and his sales leader isn't

58
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:49,234
going to give him much in terms of assistance for those engagements.

59
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,894
He's on his own and probably going to be looking for a new job pretty

60
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:55,586
soon. But if he has a timeline, the compelling

61
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:59,618
event can establish valid technical use case that differentiate versus

62
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:02,966
competitors, and it's clear there's significant budget. If those use cases

63
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:06,666
be proven out well, the sales leadership team is going to give him

64
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:10,618
and you effectively carte blanche on what you need to 100%

65
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:14,366
realize the value to make you comfortable in your spend meetings to

66
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:18,174
discuss and in some case negotiate roadmap for their executives one

67
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:21,866
on one technical sessions with end users. The world's

68
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:25,066
going to effectively be your oyster, and you'll also likely

69
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,706
get access to their leadership team. So if that rep, for example, leaves for

70
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,998
another opportunity, or you're just not establishing the rapport that you're

71
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:35,826
looking for, you'll have a backdoor and you won't have to start all over.

72
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:39,574
If you have a legitimate project and you've shared all the information you

73
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,966
need, you should feel 100% empowered to ask them for their

74
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:46,134
full effort too. For example, you shouldn't have to ever

75
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:49,754
write notes in a meeting. Ask them to take notes and summarize every

76
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:53,494
meeting, including who attended from each team, what has discussed,

77
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:57,514
and what the mutually agreed upon next keeps are. And that

78
00:04:57,552 --> 00:05:01,418
word mutual is important. Review those emails and feel free to

79
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:04,666
object in a reply if it doesn't seen that you're in alignment.

80
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:08,586
To avoid any long running confusion, nip it right there in the bud.

81
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:12,110
And lastly, as we're about to dive into more deeply in some of these later

82
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,570
slides, meet in person at the office whenever possible.

83
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,650
There's a very good reason why they're asking to do so, and it is in

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,294
your benefit. Now let's start on that topic.

85
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:27,874
Why does your sales rep always want to meet? Live zooms

86
00:05:27,922 --> 00:05:31,240
and calls are so much more convenient. Why not just do that?

87
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,170
Well, here's why. In the aftermath of last financial crisis,

88
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,614
a group called the CBB was flabbergasted as to

89
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:41,930
how, with such low budgets and high scrutiny, some sales

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,660
keeps were pretty much performing just as well as before.

91
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,226
One of the many key realizations they made was that high performing

92
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:54,382
reps in modern software purchasing cycles understand that

93
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:58,058
decisions are seldom made on a top down basis anymore,

94
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:01,834
in part because ceos, ctos, et cetera,

95
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:05,954
they don't want to be accountable if the purchase doesn't work out. But they

96
00:06:05,992 --> 00:06:09,746
likely also haven't been hands on keeps for years. So more than anything,

97
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:13,726
they value highly the opinions

98
00:06:13,758 --> 00:06:16,340
of their subordinates. Very much so.

99
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,894
What this means purchases have become very complex

100
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:25,250
election like processes which in an enterprise organization

101
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,278
can, including dozens and dozens of constituents with several differing

102
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:32,650
personas. High performing sales keeps know

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,038
how to identify and engage with each of these seven personas,

104
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:40,060
and it's one of their most important jobs to help you do so.

105
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,834
And that's really hard to do so on a Zoom call with cameras off,

106
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:47,406
or heck, even on. Let's remember, what's being said is usually a

107
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:50,926
fraction as important as how it's said, and not being able to see how

108
00:06:50,948 --> 00:06:54,138
it's being perceived by those in the room is a huge handicap for sales reps

109
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:57,774
as they work to really help you understand how important each topic

110
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:01,346
concern is. After all, haven't we all really been on

111
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:04,754
those calls with a loud voice? Isn't really asking questions that the whole

112
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:08,178
group finds important. By being there in the office live with

113
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:10,806
you during these meetings, your sales rep is going to be able to help you

114
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:14,370
validate your hypotheses on who belongs in each of these seven personas

115
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,846
and how to approach them, and how to nurture them into being allies in a

116
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:21,500
fraction of the time that you're going to spend without their help.

117
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,482
Now, before we dive into each of these personas, you'll notice I have

118
00:07:25,536 --> 00:07:29,926
three circled has mobilizers. Why that's important is mobilizers

119
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,486
are the personas that have the most significant influence in

120
00:07:33,508 --> 00:07:36,094
your company, likely due to their position,

121
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:39,834
perceived expertise, or their ability to really rally

122
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:43,398
support from their colleagues. They're proactive in identifying leading

123
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:46,894
strategic initiatives and opportunities for improvement.

124
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:51,042
They're skilled at building alliances and gaining buyin from stakeholders all across

125
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,430
your company. They've done this before and most importantly,

126
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,454
they're known for getting things done. They overcome obstacles, and they have

127
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:01,814
a reputation for making sure that their initiatives that they support stay on

128
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:05,046
track. Now let's briefly dive through each of these

129
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,594
personas and talk why some are mobilizers, why some aren't,

130
00:08:08,642 --> 00:08:11,100
and some extra nuance you might want us to consider.

131
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,286
Now, we'll start with a go getter. They're someone that's enthusiastic

132
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:18,986
about driving change. They're willing to take risks, and they're persuasive with

133
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:22,298
their colleagues in pushing for new ideas. If you and your rep can

134
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:25,454
get them the insights and data they need to show the benefits of change,

135
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,954
they'll get things done for you. This is similar to the climber,

136
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:32,858
but the reason the climber isn't immobilizer is their motivation tends

137
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:36,250
to be on more personal advancement rather than what's good for

138
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,614
the company. And let's face it, it's not really a secret internally

139
00:08:39,662 --> 00:08:43,458
or with leadership. They're, as a result, less likely to take risks that

140
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:46,698
would really hurt their upward progress, even slightly

141
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,746
so. And oftentimes they don't have nearly the internal

142
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:53,206
influence that go getters have. Some of you,

143
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:57,218
as we proceed, might be a little surprised that I have skeptics circled.

144
00:08:57,314 --> 00:09:00,940
I mean, after all, blocker isn't and aren't those kind of similar?

145
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,386
So while both blockers and skeptics may exhibit resistance to

146
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:08,826
change, blockers tend to be more dogmatic, you could say, in their

147
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:12,766
opposition, and they may actively work against progress for you.

148
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:16,622
Whereas skeptics, they're a little bit more open minded. They approach change

149
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:20,202
with caution, but they're open to dialogue and persuasion.

150
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:24,674
So has. Long as you get them the information they need to

151
00:09:24,712 --> 00:09:27,826
support why they should support you, you're going

152
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:31,634
to find that they're the most valuable purchase in your process.

153
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:35,154
They'll get everybody almost unilaterally to

154
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,800
really agree with you. Now,

155
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,090
with blockers, it's important to approach with caution,

156
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,994
depending on how much power they have. Internet. If you do engage,

157
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,934
though, address their concerns and points with serious empathy

158
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:53,174
and work to identifying common ground and mutually beneficial paths

159
00:09:53,222 --> 00:09:57,370
forward. Don't do anything that's going to risk putting you in their crosshairs.

160
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,066
So you all might realize now, why don't I

161
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:04,540
have friends circled here? I mean, who doesn't need friends in this world?

162
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,640
While friends may support you and have some role in the process,

163
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,874
in this purpose of this framework, friends don't really have the seniority

164
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:16,706
or influence to push your initiative forward. Spending a ton of

165
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:20,318
time with your friends when you're lobbying, it can be a real distraction,

166
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:24,546
as even if they vote yes, their vote won't be nearly as important as

167
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:27,060
that of a mobilizer Persona with more power.

168
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,794
So the last mobilizer Persona we want to address is the teacher.

169
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,906
Teachers have a wealth of experience and expertise, and they're pumped

170
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:39,746
to share with their peers what they're looking into. They're open to new ideas,

171
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,798
and they love staying up to date and engaging in conversation about current trends.

172
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:47,834
Much like the other mobilizer personas, they're highly regarded in the

173
00:10:47,872 --> 00:10:51,306
organization. If you give them the data they need to understand why this

174
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:54,080
should be a priority for them, they're going to support you.

175
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,606
So, as we conclude this slide, I want to share that the

176
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:01,950
biggest mistake I see by far is sales keeps and project

177
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:05,346
leaders avoiding the skeptic and just hoping they'll go

178
00:11:05,368 --> 00:11:08,818
away and instead spending that time with friends.

179
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:12,706
I mean, we all like hearing yes, hearing no. It can

180
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:16,834
be a little bit disarming. The problem with that,

181
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:20,370
and I've seen this in dozens and dozens of engagements,

182
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,958
is the skeptics in your they're going to get a

183
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:27,302
vote. And if you jumped around them and spent months and

184
00:11:27,356 --> 00:11:30,582
months proving out value has, I've done with several

185
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,980
prospects, months and months of proving out value,

186
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,666
all that work went down the drain. Because in the last minute, some of

187
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:42,426
these skeptics, which we actually persuaded later, after several more months and

188
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:46,218
coming to work with us and being on our side, those skeptics delayed

189
00:11:46,234 --> 00:11:49,966
the project because they felt like they were skirted around. So if

190
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:53,486
there's one thing I want you to take from this slide,

191
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:57,790
please have it be this. Do not avoid the skeptic.

192
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,254
Don't chase years, chase the confrontation,

193
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:05,726
and with empathy and logic and reasoning,

194
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,120
overcome why they should be on your side.

195
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,566
Now, let's continue the conversation on the most important points I

196
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:16,066
have in this presentation. Your goal, as you look to gain

197
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:19,926
internal support should not, and I repeat, should not be

198
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,354
to build a chaos engineering practice. After all,

199
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:26,874
you could have a chaos engineering practice and not do things right,

200
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:30,554
which, as we all know, could result in a pretty monumental negative for your

201
00:12:30,592 --> 00:12:34,014
company. Your goal is to make improvements that

202
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:37,802
drive your business forward. Focus on measurable and achievable

203
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:41,054
outcomes that your confident fault injection, as I like to call

204
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:45,154
it, will actually help you with things like increasing availability by x

205
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:49,410
percent, reducing downtime, or meantime to resolution.

206
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,946
I'd actually really recommend not using the term chaos at

207
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:56,798
all. Let me tell you a little story about why so one

208
00:12:56,824 --> 00:13:00,646
engagement a few years back was the very technical and

209
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:04,130
impressive group of engineers. These guys and gals were brilliant

210
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,926
and they had pull and had a super impressive POC where

211
00:13:07,948 --> 00:13:10,730
we found tons of bugs that would have made it for production.

212
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,446
However, they also loved the term chaos. Absolutely loved

213
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:18,490
it. They even had t shirts. Unfortunately,

214
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,538
during the approval process, we found out that pretty much none

215
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,200
of their executives did. Why?

216
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,358
Chaos engineering, thanks to marketing, has become a really,

217
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:33,274
really loaded term. There are so many misconceptions about chaos

218
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:36,302
engineering that distract stakeholders from what you're trying to achieve,

219
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:40,114
and in their case, that ambiguity resulted in the six month delay in actually

220
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,094
getting funding approved. In fact, even Netflix

221
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:46,900
doesn't use the term chaos engineering anymore for this reason.

222
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,174
On that note is this. The next couple slides are going to detail rather

223
00:13:51,212 --> 00:13:55,046
than make it its whole individual initiative and risk creating the perception, this is

224
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,854
a whole new thing that your teams have to do. I'd really recommend

225
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,774
viewing and presenting fault injection as a critical adjoining

226
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:06,326
portion of other initiatives that are already perceived as highly

227
00:14:06,358 --> 00:14:09,962
important. And the reason for this is simple. There are a ton

228
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,882
of things your company should do, but in reality,

229
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:17,326
let's be honest, time is scarce. Only the

230
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:20,720
most important things are actually going to get done,

231
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:24,874
and also a side benefit. By going into these more high priority

232
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:28,194
initiatives that are already established, you're going to get access to

233
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:32,114
a lot more mobilizers that maybe you wouldn't have met or interacted with

234
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:35,394
before, and you're going to have a great opportunity to making

235
00:14:35,432 --> 00:14:38,742
sure that everything is fully understood and that you

236
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:41,590
actually get budget as a part of their line items.

237
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,146
Let's start with the biggest one in my experience, the cloud migration.

238
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:50,298
The IDC estimates that orgs are going to spend over trillion dollars

239
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:53,674
this year on cloud initiatives and support services,

240
00:14:53,872 --> 00:14:58,060
and this is estimated to go up by about 15% each year.

241
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,494
If you're in a major enterprise organization, it's highly,

242
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:05,274
highly likely that this is your highest visibility and highest priority

243
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,986
initiative at your company. If things don't go well, your leadership

244
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:12,720
team and your company's stock value not going to have a fun time.

245
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,626
Rather than assuming that things are going to work as expected and rushing things out

246
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:20,226
the door this is a perfect opportunity for you and your sales rep to

247
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:24,334
highlight how critical fault injection can be in valuing that your resilience,

248
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,990
scalability, performance and recovery strategies work as planned before

249
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,286
you risk costly and embarrassing downtime. And the

250
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:34,674
earlier you find these issues, the easier and less expensive

251
00:15:34,722 --> 00:15:38,454
it'll be to fix them. Is your leadership team really willing to

252
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:42,022
risk messing up one of their most important initiatives? I'd wager

253
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:43,980
probably not, if you frame it this way.

254
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,454
Now, I'll start off this next slide with a bit of a self deprecating

255
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:52,086
reality I had recently in my three years of selling fault

256
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,726
injection, I'm pretty sure I made more money for Datadog than I made in

257
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:59,310
my three years actually working for them. I've been in

258
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,274
countless game days with brilliant engineers, but I'd still need a few dozen

259
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:07,134
more fingers and toes to count how often we thought things were performance expected,

260
00:16:07,182 --> 00:16:10,866
as long as certain metrics weren't surpassed only to learn that,

261
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:14,654
yeah, things still weren't fine because we weren't collecting nearly

262
00:16:14,702 --> 00:16:18,134
enough metrics to truly understand when things would go haywire. And we

263
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:22,194
only knew that because we tested before we went live. And that's

264
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:25,894
nothing to be ashamed of. It's actually to be expected, especially when

265
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:29,558
using brand new cloud and container services that your teams have never used before.

266
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:33,146
Jobs are hard if you aren't validating on a

267
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:36,886
repeated basis that alerting thresholds don't need to be adjusted with new releases,

268
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:40,454
and you're not collecting all the metrics that you need to truly understand the impact

269
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:44,442
of specific performance issues, especially when oftentimes those additional

270
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:48,078
metrics are free and just need to be configured. Are you really getting the

271
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:51,454
most out of your observability spend? Couldn't you just make

272
00:16:51,492 --> 00:16:53,940
a minor change and get a lot more value?

273
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,446
Another couple of use cases I've seen be really valuable to tie

274
00:16:58,478 --> 00:17:02,542
onto are making Dr. Not a disaster

275
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:06,642
and education budgets. So many

276
00:17:06,696 --> 00:17:10,566
of the banks that I worked with, I effectively found they realized that

277
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:14,130
their engineers were not meeting Dr. Protocols and standards.

278
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,894
They weren't testing to see that things worked has expected by

279
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,800
using a cloud and platform agnostic fault injection tool,

280
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,154
you're good to go. It makes it way easier if we have

281
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,426
things that we want people to do, we want to make it as easy as

282
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,106
possible to do that and using updated tooling and modern

283
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:35,934
tooling can be a great way to make disaster recovery way less

284
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,594
painful. So it's actually done. In education budgets,

285
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,634
I actually sold an almost six figure deal to a customer that

286
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:47,522
didn't even actually plan on making chaos engineering mainstream across

287
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:51,202
their different teams. They actually wanted to use it with their

288
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:55,086
interns, hundreds and hundreds of interns every summer.

289
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:58,818
They wanted to effectively show them how all the different components and

290
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:02,454
the systems are going to work work. So they had no plans to even

291
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:05,974
go on production or even use on a large scale. They just found

292
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:08,834
it as a key part of their education curriculum.

293
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:12,234
Moving forward now, on top of tying to other high

294
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:15,914
priority initiatives, this slide also shows a fairly easy way to show

295
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:19,466
value by quantifying how much adding another nine can have on

296
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:23,654
your bottom line. In this fictitious example, I use $5,000

297
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:27,706
as the cost of downtime per hour, despite my research showing that the average

298
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:31,214
for major enterprise orgs is as high as 9000. My reason for

299
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:35,358
doing so as we all know, these numbers can get a bit squirrely sometimes.

300
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:39,426
If you get too aggressive on these estimations and a block or a skeptic comes

301
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:43,742
in the fold, you really risk losing credibility. However, if you're conservative

302
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:47,494
in your estimates and can still show a huge savings, that's pretty

303
00:18:47,532 --> 00:18:50,678
powerful. This is admittedly pretty simple,

304
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:54,870
but if you'd like a more comprehensive calculator complete with far more information

305
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,006
and variables, I definitely recommend checking out the

306
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:01,174
new harness chaos engineering ROI calculator that I worked

307
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:04,458
on was over there. And while you're at it, feel free to tell um and

308
00:19:04,464 --> 00:19:07,706
the chaos native team that I say hey. The next thing I

309
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:11,738
really want to emphasize is the importance of coming up with an implementation plan.

310
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:15,118
The reason being is fairly simple. Your leaders are going to

311
00:19:15,124 --> 00:19:18,494
want to seen that you've put serious thought in this. The last thing

312
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,826
they want is more shelfware. Be sure to include what applications

313
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:26,594
and years you'd like to start with and what the business impact would be if

314
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,906
they participate, what metrics are used to track success and

315
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:33,582
what internal resources will you need. Also, what adjustments

316
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:37,810
to incentive structures need to be made to incentivize participation.

317
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,894
Also, the more you know about your use cases, the better

318
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,490
likelihood that you'll be able to negotiate an advantageous deal with a vendor.

319
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,030
While most I've seen are charging on a per service level

320
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,678
basis with x amount of tests per service included,

321
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,282
if you have a ton of services but only want to test them

322
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:59,926
a fraction of the amount that's included, it's highly likely

323
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:03,486
that you'll be able to negotiate a heavy discount and greatly reduce the

324
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:06,430
likelihood of only using a small portion of your entitlements.

325
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,086
So, to conclude our time together, remember your sales rep when

326
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,206
used correctly, and as long as you don't feed them after midnight or get

327
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:18,174
them wet can actually make life a lot easier. And you'll likely find their

328
00:20:18,212 --> 00:20:21,834
help really valuable when navigating through your company's internal politics,

329
00:20:21,962 --> 00:20:25,398
especially if you're able to provide the answers their leaders are looking for. Show the

330
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:29,014
deal is real, and most importantly, stick to business value

331
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:32,754
and kill the chaos buzz. Trust me, I've done hundreds

332
00:20:32,802 --> 00:20:36,486
and thousands of these engagements. Now it seems it'll save you

333
00:20:36,508 --> 00:20:40,406
a ton of time and heartbreak. Thanks again to Mark and Miko for

334
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:43,606
putting on such a great event, and to you all for tuning in. That's a

335
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:47,078
wrap for today. Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me

336
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:48,530
an email if you'd like to continue the conversation.
